So just running through my LinkedIn here, we&#39;ve been trying to use my LinkedIn account for company marketing, essentially post regular content that will be valuable to our customers.
And if you go to post, you can see, um, there&#39;s videos, there&#39;s images, and I&#39;m also, have carousels that I&#39;ve done.
And this is actually a really good example of the branding that I&#39;m looking to, uh, this was designed by a freelancer.
But you can see the colors and everything. And then, often, there&#39;s also an ending image at the top, at the end.
Uhm, I also sometimes post photos, uhm, that is showing more personal stories.
But, essentially, what I&#39;m going to do is, I&#39;m going to set up a, this, I&#39;ve set up this page, this, uhm, task list here, and when I have an idea for a project, or I can go through my notes and try to gather them, I&#39;ll put it into the idea, section, and, uhm, we can use this to track, uhm, projects that
you&#39;re working on, and essentially put this into in progress, and then when it&#39;s ready for me to review, I can use it here, And that&#39;s it.
And once I approve it, I&#39;ll put it into ready, and then I&#39;ll schedule it, uhm, I might even, I might even get you access to the tool that I use for, uh, publishing this, uhm, and I&#39;m not, uh, I&#39;m thinking about putting all ideas in here, even the ones that may not need designs, that&#39;s using video, So
that it&#39;s centralized, uhm, and see, we&#39;ll see if this method works. And I created a couple of different fields here.
One is we can use it to assign it to each other. Um, the date is, I guess, um, when it was added.
and then this one, I actually have a, a attachment here that I added, and this is, uh, a, a little mini brief.
And when you work on a design, you can share it as the URL here. This supports attach, uh, comments and notifications.
Um, so we can toggle back and forth easily. And, um, yeah, thank you for that. I&#39;m, I&#39;m totally, um, open to anything that will work.
You know, we don&#39;t have to, uh, use this manually. So, if feel free to, um, uh, make suggestions and I can use a workflow that works better for you.
And then, uh, once we establish a process, we can think about how we want to, um, um, expand to other team members.
So, for example, Katie. Is, uhm, also someone that is actively pro, uh, posting online for the sake of building up her brand.
And when we build up our brand, we&#39;re also going to be, hopefully, attracting other individuals, uhm, that will want to buy the system.
So, but, we can focus on people. Myself, and then, establish the brand and the process, and then see how we can help others, uhm, I will also get you an, access to our Canva account, so that you can use that, uhm, the other tool that I use is called, uhm, called, And.
Uh, Super Grow, so, uhm, I will, uhm, I&#39;ll get you in, uhm, into our password management tool and then give you access to this.
Uh, this allows us to schedule posts and get this out. Uhm, Sylvana used to help me with this, but these days, uh, we&#39;ve shifted her focus to sales and management.
So, we&#39;re, we want to use this for different designing and or publishing. Um, this might be something that is helpful.
One of the things I really like about this is their AI tool. Um, so I can take any video or article and then have it draft.
A post for me, uh, which I can take care of and then I can put that as drafts in here and then it would, um, be something that, yeah, actually this, this actually might work better.
Think about it. We can put this in here. I can put drafts in here and then essentially you can look at it.
I didn&#39;t say what image do we want to put in here, uh, add, and then we can use to schedule and it automatically publishes to LinkedIn.
Um, and if this works well, um, we can add other team members in here and have one central place to manage this.
Um, all right. again, I&#39;m trying to squeeze in, uh, this in between my other, other work. Uh, so what I really am hoping to do is get you oriented to all of the, uh, things that I&#39;m, I&#39;m hoping to publish and then, um, give you the creative freedom to create designs and later on you can even.
Go ahead and publish it and on, on a schedule that you think it&#39;s good. Cause, uh, I know that I get pulled in several different directions and sometimes this falls apart and the company gets a lot of value from me posting because I&#39;m connected to a lot of medical education leaders.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e3adcf74e48748998b9e4f22039029fe</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Using LinkedIn for Company Marketing 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Clara.

Right now, this is not available on the site administrator page, but we can and add permissions to grant that access if this Report will help, uh, address the problem.
So one of the things that you can do on this report is select one or more sites. So what we could do is give site level access to different administrators and then automatically have these selected, so when you scroll down, it&#39;s going to show all the students that are scheduled to come there.
So if I change the date range, it&#39;ll show you all students that are scheduled there. This also includes an Excel export that has contact information for the student and all the details that they need to, uh, uh, be aware of, like the, the, uh, site administrators.
Uhm, there is also a way to filter by individual students if you need to. So that may give them a cleaner way to look at this data.
Another thing that we can consider is a report that&#39;s currently not activated. And that is this page, which you can access, uhm, this is a, I&#39;m not sure if you actually can access it, uhm, it is something that we built for our, uhm, residency programs, and it has a way to pull in all schedules from the
system and then be able to search for it. The reason that we haven&#39;t released it for the student side is because it&#39;s meant to look at all schedules, and also access, uh, be access, uh, accessible without logging into the system.
But if the view works, we can potentially add more permissions here and make it, uhm, available to the students. Uhm, the, main thing that we can do here is, you know, really dive, let&#39;s say if I want to search for Thrive, it will show me all the schedules like it does from the Site Rotator report, but
in a calendar view or timeline view. And I can dig into it if I want to put to a specific rotation.
And see all the assignments there. So those are a couple of views that may help. I looked at the mock-up that you shared also, and that&#39;s something that, uhm, we can also explore, uhm, but giving access to an existing page would be easier for, uh, for us to get this out there, uhm, and, uh, one more
thing that I would want to discuss further is, right now in your mock-up, you showed having a corporate partner as the parent, and then subgroups for each of the practices.
I believe when we set this up, I&#39;ll show on the Sites page, we have, uhm, the parent or the Thrive or whatever the corporate partner name is.
It&#39;s simply added as a name of the, uhm, site as a prefix. We&#39;re not, we don&#39;t have any database. Record that we can use to group create those subgroups.
If we need to do that, we may want to explore. There&#39;s an employer field. I think we briefly talked about it when we initially implemented metrics as a potential.
Solution. Uhm, but currently that employer field is not used on the schedules page. Anyway, I wanted to. I wanted to send this over to you to look at 1st and then we can hop on a call and maybe run through the.
The different options.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cd10a1acfeab4a6f955bdceaa54b76d1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>System Updates and Enhancements 💻</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So, running through these, ah, quickly. This one, nothing to do. This one, nothing to do. This one also is done.
So here, we were gonna, add a create event button, so you can just take a look at this to make sure that you&#39;re good with how it shows up.
This one has nothing, nothing here. I&#39;m going to put this actually, Back to candidate for now.
Oh yeah, so this deactivation one, what we want to do is, when we deactivate a user, we show the modal with a bunch of things that they can do.
At the bottom of the comment field we also want to show this as a deactivation reason and a comment field.
So that is optional. The comment is optional. The reason would be, um, we can make it, um, we can actually add a setting in the institutional portal to make this required or not.
So if it&#39;s required, then each person will be required to put this in. We can actually add a setting in portal to make this required or not So if it&#39;s required, then each person will be required activate the user, or they want to cancel.
This one, nothing. So, for this task, we want to simply update the specs to make sure that it&#39;s clear. That this functionality already works, if the program type equals GME, you want to make sure that it&#39;s worked for UME.
Uhm, so for this, this functionality, add a way to bring up a modal when you approve or reject, so that they can add a comment.
A comment will be optional, and then, uhm, if a comment is added, we want to show that on the student portal, I mean on the user&#39;s portal when they are reviewing it.
So I think the first thing to do is just kind of look at, submit a request and approve or reject it, to see how it currently works.
I&#39;m not sure if we currently have a comment field. Uhm, and then, we want to be, if you, if you, if you, you want to have an edit function, so they can fix any changes, any, any mistakes that they want to, uhm, or you can reject it.
And then if you do approve or reject it, you want to have an undo button so that you can put it back into the pending status, uhm, to correct any mistakes.
Uh, nothing for here. So, for this one, we want to do that on the company portal, like we have here, but also on the personal, I mean, on the institutional portal, under system setup permissions, they have a roles page, and we want to have a little disable email notifications checkbox.
So, even if you&#39;re creating this roles on the company portal, or doing it on the institutional portal, we have a way to disable the checkbox.
And then if it&#39;s, if that checkbox is turned on, then all email notifications will be disabled. This one I&#39;m going to take care of.
So, for this design on the block schedule audit report, uh, what we want to do is make sure we use a little checkbox, oh, I think it&#39;s already on.
Checkboxes. So, you have it, uh, already using checkboxes. We also want to apply that to the action column so that if you want to select multiple actions and search, it&#39;ll, it&#39;ll show that on the bottom.
Uhm, so, on the edit demographics page, when you are … selecting, uh, uh, adding a user, we can have a check for duplicates button.
It&#39;ll bring up this modal, where … you will see any of the search results for the first or last name that matches.
And if they want to affiliate that person, they can go ahead and do that right there, or they can close and create, create the user.
And this is for the … showing the sys section number and class number. I want to show it at the bottom in one line.
Uh, but it only shows up if they have the data. If they don&#39;t have it, then it doesn&#39;t show up.
And we want to show this on the admin portal. As well as the personal portal, uhm, if it exists.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b2528a4982994a93a9ba1ecc0e0d773c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Exploring New Tools and Techniques 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>Record this as I&#39;m playing around with this, uhm, uhm, playing around with the cursor and trying something new.

And if something good happens, I&#39;ll share it. I have a new merge request that I pulled. Uhm, and I wanted to analyze some of the pages that we had redone recently and see if I can create a list of standard bootstrap tags.
and CSS. So Rio had sent me this list here, so I&#39;m going to take a this and then for this exercise, I&#39;m going to use the normal mode and not the agent because I&#39;m researching and the other thing is, uh, when you&#39;re using the normal mode and not the agent, you can use different models and for something
like this where it needs to figure stuff out. The OpenAI 01 model is probably going to be better because it&#39;s better at reasoning as opposed to when you&#39;re writing code, uhm, the Claude 3.5 SONNET is what&#39;s recommended.
And that works with the agent. I believe we&#39;re at four.
Oh, and I, asked it to ask me clarifying questions at the end. I&#39;m just going to find, if I can find the, uh, new UI kit.
myself, myself, Actually, let&#39;s do this.
Uhm. Let it find out using what&#39;s in the system.
So I&#39;m putting in, uhm, work in sprints to analyze it because this will likely be a big project.
So if it tries to do all of it at once, the result is not going to be as good. All the pages .
. . . . Alright, so, provided, uhm, so I had given a list of the pages, but I forgot to want to make sure it doesn&#39;t get lost, so I gave it some of the later page, one of the, some of the newer pages as examples.
So I just want to save this as cursor rules.
Let&#39;s go back to our other model. Now I want to try something on the performance page, which is, does not, is not very standardized.

Yeah. So, uhm, in the future, you need to help prioritize with the team. So Mike and I usually are the ones that are going over this, but this comes from a whole bunch of people and I&#39;m usually the person that&#39;s deciding whether or not something should get done.
And I&#39;ll kind of talk out loud what I&#39;m thinking. Um, so for this one, for, for example, I&#39;m looking at, yeah.
Oh, I thought you were, okay. And you got a three now, okay. Alright, whatever. Alright. So, I mean, this isn&#39;t like burning desire, I&#39;m sure.
This is nothing nobody&#39;s waiting on. Yeah, so, essentially I&#39;m on the design board on JIRA. So, design board has three, three columns.
Um, candidate is where we&#39;re putting anything that we&#39;re, that&#39;s, uh, in the near future. But I&#39;m trying to cut this down because we have too many accumulated in there.
So this is like the design specific part, so this isn&#39;t like where all the shit is going to go. Yeah, pre-Augustan, this is where basically it&#39;s my, it&#39;s me deciding, um, what should be done then, but it also has other stuff that Mike has worked on with Maria or, uh, Chris, but ultimately.

If you are, this is not referring to a specific module of metrics. This section on our homepage is referring to different segments that we serve, um, undergraduate medical education being medical schools, and then graduate medical education being residency, and then um all these other type of programs
, and then eventually clinical practice, which is meant to capture the needs of a practicing physician or nurse. So this is uh yeah, exactly as you have described here.
Uhm, so this area is really not a our primary focus right now, but the platform has always been built in a way that it can be used both for the trainees as well as our practicing physicians.
And you can set up metrics with different set of roles, different set of permissions, and it can be used for a practicing physician.
We have one institution that recently purchased it for managing the credentials of the practicing physicians that are also involved with the residency program.
And the primary focus here is actually is for the entire management of that individual. So, for example, if we go into Metrics, they can use our requirements module to onboard a faculty members to collect various paperwork when they first hire them.
This includes certifications. Medical licenses, CVs, this can be collected in a streamlined manner and be stored in Metrics with expiration dates with alerts for when those documents are expiring.
And when they need these paperwork, we can also pull it up, uhm, they can pull it up pretty quickly. We also have the ability to generate employment contracts, so if the hospital has a standardized contract, they can put that into the system and it&#39;ll generate it.
We&#39;re also planning on expanding that to send that document out for signature if they need to. Uhm, so, uhm, in terms of vision for this product, uhm, for customer retention, we&#39;re looking for lifetime, forever, uhm, you know, our platform is sold as an annual recurring contract and and when we onboard
a physician, uhm, actually let me, let me, uh, be specific here, when I&#39;m talking about metrics as an enterprise solution, that&#39;s our approach.
These practicing physicians, uhm, that will be using metrics are using it within the context of their organization. We currently don&#39;t have a mechanism for them to have their own data outside of metrics.
Uhm, we had, uh, ideas in the past for creating like a personal version of metrics that allows them to take that data with them, but it&#39;s not something that we have worked on.
Each of our clients are purchasing the, each of our organizations are purchasing the platform and then their physicians will be using it when they are employed at that organization.
And we only sell this as recurring revenue as a SaaS model, so they pay based on the number of learners they have.
And faculty licenses are typically free if it&#39;s in, if the faculty is using the system in the context of a residency program or a medical school.
But if they&#39;re going to be using it for managing faculty paperwork, then they would pay less. per user license. So the, yeah, the current value is for this particular budget, this is not this, we don&#39;t have too many, I think we have one or maybe two that is using it for clinical, um, workflow.
And it&#39;s really because we haven&#39;t really focused on that, um, in terms of marketing and trying to sell for that market because it&#39;s more of a developing need, because in the past there wasn&#39;t really any need for a software for faculty and institutions weren&#39;t willing to pay for it.
Um, but the accreditation requirements of the residency program and medical schools makes it required to have something. But we&#39;re starting to see more competency-based faculty management too, and I think that&#39;s also where metrics can offer value.
And then if they&#39;re already using you for residency, it&#39;s an easy add to sell to them, um, the faculty module.
But, yeah, so we do all of this work for performance evaluations, um, easily doable using our evaluations module, like we do for residency.
We can do tracking, reporting, um, we can also do um, using a curriculum module, we can have a training content.
One of the things that we currently don&#39;t do is, um, self-enrolling courses, it&#39;s something that we&#39;ve, it&#39;s on the roadmap, but we haven&#39;t done that.
Quality and accreditation compliance, so we have a built-in module called projects that allows them to build quality improvement and research projects in directly in metrics.
Care and, um, care outcomes tracking and reporting. This is a bit of a stretch for us, you know, we currently don&#39;t, um, this is outside the scope of what we would want to do, like we don&#39;t want to get into the realm of clinical patient data, metrics always always, uh, wants to stay focused on providing
technology for the health professional, um, we don&#39;t want to get into the area of HIPAA and patient data, um, um, that, that really should be a separate, separate tool, but where it may overlap is let&#39;s say a physician wants to do a research or a quality improvement project to improve patient safety,
they may use our product to track that project and then document it as part of a scholarly activity. Um, pricing model is pretty simple.
Um, but it is bought by the institution. So, if an institution wants to purchase our platform based on the number of users they have, um, we would come up with a proposal and it&#39;s a bit of a complex sales model.
process with discussion on how many users, what modules they need, and then, um, we would come up with a annual subscription rate based on that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7bb10332a6e44c34bda5347b349bcd67</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Exploring GPT Engineer and Superbase Integration</pre></td><td><pre>And that&#39;s been really successful, since then I&#39;ve now running about four to five projects in GPT Engineer concurrently. Um, and as mentioned before, working with my co-founders to actually make products that we&#39;re launching as a start-up and a bit separate to doing B2B more B2C.
Needless to say, being very locked in with GPT Engineer, and it&#39;s enabled me to work with some really great cool clients really quickly.
We&#39;re now working with Dewipes, um, from the States to help them build their products. And I think this meme, like, generally helps give me, give you guys the idea of the feeling most clients have when I show them GPT Engineer.
They&#39;re amazed at the speed that you can build things with, and they&#39;re also very quick and happy to hand over the budget.
Um, to build, to build out stuff, they immediately see the value, uh, uh, of using it. And I, I think it&#39;s just worth mentioning that this tool really is kind of a game changer because every dev that I&#39;ve shown it to, they&#39;re able to build stuff in days now when it would have taken them a month.
And they always say that, they&#39;re always like, wow, that was so quick. This would have taken me, like, you know, a lot longer than, than I thought it would be.
Anyway, I&#39;m going to jump into some quick demos, um, just of some stuff that we&#39;ve built over the last couple, couple of months now that I think are a great kind of demo of what, what&#39;s achievable in, um, GPT Engineer.
So, first of all, it&#39;s really easy now for us to be able to build tools to organize our own work.
Um, and I can build stuff that&#39;s very specific to what my company&#39;s doing, you know, uh, the meetings we have, the projects and tasks we have, even building out our own kind of dashboards for reporting.
So, we can very easily see what we&#39;re working on and what, what needs to be, uh, achieved. generating data reports, and then enabling my team to also leave stand-ups really easily as well.
Internal tools are just one part of it, but also building stuff for clients. Uh, in this demo, I&#39;m going to build our, uh, workspaces for a compliance company that we&#39;re working with in Texas.
They weren&#39;t satisfied with the tools they were using to communicate with their clients, so we built them these custom workspaces that allow them to organize their tasks with their clients, files, uh, etc.
We&#39;re using Cicabase, which is really, really easy and, uh, and useful process to go through. Obviously, the benefits of using custom code when you&#39;re building this stuff for your clients is you can build them cool stuff like admin dashboards, so they can come in and edit this data really, really easily
. A lot of people might say, well, GPT engineer isn&#39;t that good at design. Uh, one of the, uh, experiments that I worked on quite, uh, early at the beginning was how can we build sort of like these really nicely designed landing pages or websites that would be able to go on, uh, websites like awards?
I think that, uh, just by feeding and good prompting, you can get GPT engineers to build out a lot of cool, uh, features that can make your front-end experience, uh, easier.
quite exciting. Uh, simple hover effects, text, uh, having a bendy line when you hover over it. Uh, sort of nice, um, carousels to hover effects to, to just about anything.
Um, and I think with the right prompting and the right descriptions and telling exactly what you want, you can very easily get, uh, quite a high, uh, level of production, uh, value and quality.
Finally, um, not just trying to sell my time, but trying to win back some time as well. Um, and we&#39;ve been able to successfully start doing that by building our own products as well.
Uh, this is Renamify. We built this with about four weeks from GPC. And what it does is it allows you to upload a file of, um, a folder of empty, of photos, uh, that you&#39;ve taken on your camera, for example, and AI will scan the content, rename them, and then you can download that content again.
Uh, you also have the ability to store that, um, store that stuff on, on the backend. I&#39;m And needless to say, adding Stripe, uh, user profiles, and just about everything else, uh, was a really simple, uh, process with GPT Engineer.
So, you know, everything from authorization to adding Stripe to stuff, uh, everything else, uh, with GPT Engineer really is a, you know, a two-minute process.
Rather than, uh, a ten-minute. I think that is it in regards to, uhm, demos and everything else. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions or, or move on based on what you guys have got for your presentation.
Super exciting. Thanks a lot for sharing, Harry. And maybe, like, one, one question already, and we&#39;ll, like, get into more in the Q&amp;A in the end, but, like, how has, like, I mean, if you think about, like, the capabilities of GPT Engineer, like, a few months ago, and, like, the evolution and all the
super-based integration, like, how has that changed, like, what you can do and are doing with the tool? Uhm, yeah, that&#39;d be super, super curious to hear.
Yeah, I, I think, like, the, the main thing is, like, the level of entry to build these solutions. Uhm, beforehand, there was a lot of fiddling, a lot of, like, twiddling your thumbs, trying to Google how the hell do you connect this, how the hell do you connect that.
Now, with the super-based integration, if, uhm, you haven&#39;t seen it already, it&#39;s a button, connect your account, and, and you&#39;re off.
Being able to have the front-end builder now understand your databases, understand your tables, uh, it makes the process a lot, lot easier.
Uh, in, you know, seven months ago, the app was pretty unusable commercially. I think that now, uh, if you&#39;re not using it commercially, you might, you might fall behind.
Like, do the AI cogeneration things are here, and I think a lot of people are, like, adamant that they&#39;re, they&#39;re not real.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/07a1d72dea4b4561922afa17a4665d79</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Overview of the Faculty Dashboard and Medtrics Functionalities</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a quick look at the faculty dashboard and what are some of the functionalities that Metrix offers.
Right on the home screen, you can see any upcoming events. You can use these date fields to switch between, ah, any date or ranges that you need to see events for.
Right in the middle, any evaluations that was recently assigned that you still have to complete. And at the bottom, there are announcements.
These announcements may be sent to you via the dashboard or via email. On the calendar page, we have the ability to see the full academic calendar.
You can also sync this with our external devices such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft. When we go to the Evaluations page, there&#39;s going to be a few tabs that you are going to have at the top.
The first is the For Me tab. This will display all of the evaluations that you have to complete for students.
And, on this page, you can, uhm, click View, see who you&#39;re evaluating. It&#39;s either clinical or, uh, rotation or clinical.
And then, fill out all the details and submit at the bottom. You can also use the Save Draft button to save the draft if you want to come back to it later.
The About Me tab will show you all of the different, uh, evaluations that were, uh, done on you by other individuals in the platform.
So this is where you can see your feedback, uh, from students or other faculty members. If your school or, uhm, hospital is using a, uhm, review tool, then if you need to review some of the evaluations or documents that were sent to you by, uhm, as part of their coursework or rotations, you can see that
in the review. Otherwise, you&#39;ll mainly be using the For Me and About Me tab. One thing I also want to point out here is, at the top, there&#39;s also a Submit As Unable To Assess.
If for some reason you cannot complete this form because you did not interact with the student, you can click this button to submit.
the form. One more thing I want to point out on this page is, ah, the Schedules, ah, page. If there are, uhm, different schedules that are published to you.
That, this is where you&#39;ll see them, uhm, this could be included student schedules or if you are working in different, ah, rotations and covering, uhm, ah, different clinical experiences, you may have these schedules, ah, up here on the Schedules page.
Otherwise, you&#39;ll otherwise, the main page that you&#39;re going to be going to is the Calendar and the Evaluations page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9e4719c7f9a747f38b66c62e4f57ed3d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Metrics for Clinical Practice 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Wanted to take a few minutes to go over this ah, these set of questions before our meeting. Uhm, figured it would be easier for me to explain some of this in a video and then we can dig into it in more detail during our call.
Specific specifically, uhm, I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re referring to this clinical practice ah, uhm, item here. This, these items here are not necessarily modules.
These are different ways that, uh, different market segments essentially that we, that we serve or are planning on serving. And it&#39;s essentially a different way to use the system.
Metrix was built in a way that it has functionality that can be, um, used for, for, uh, different types of, um, it can be custom configured to work for different academic programs or different types of, um, um, specialties.
So, this clinical practice is really referring to using metrics to manage the, uh, the, uh, professional requirements of a practicing physician.
or nurse. Um, most of this is going to be using the same modules that we have that is being used for the residency, but it&#39;s going to be used by the faculty.
So, let me explain what I mean by that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b011338b45d141ac9e1832d68f509fd7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Optimizing the Clinical Schedule Process</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so in this, uh, update, we&#39;re gonna be making a few changes to our lottery page, uhm, so the lottery is on the left menu under schedules, so let&#39;s start with main changes, schedule.
So first thing, left menu, The left menu, we&#39;re going to, uhm, rename Lottery to Optimizer.
And on this page, uhm, we&#39;ll have new optimization button. We won&#39;t be doing the global. This is manage global constraints in this task.
So you can ignore that. And here we&#39;ll have name status, data table with name status. Details, role, important dates, action.
And action will have a drop down with different options. So, when I click new optimization, it&#39;ll bring up this window.
Uhm, and, uh, this window, I&#39;m gonna go through it using this UI. Uhm, the other one is not fully updated yet.
Here, I can choose an academic period and then it&#39;ll let me select one of the existing block schedules. So, remember that Metrix has block schedules under the schedules page on the clinical side.
It&#39;s clinical schedules page and it lets, lets you select one and then continue. When you press continue, you can give a name for the optimization, capacity collection date, capacity collection close date, preference collection open date, preference collection close date, the optimization date.
optimization run date, uhm, see it. So the capacity collection date is going to be the date that we&#39;re going to allow, uhm, different, different site coordinators to enter the site capacities.
preferences is going to be the students enter the preferences, uhm, and then select, how do you want to define your, uh, capacity, only by site, only, uhm, only by block or both by site and block, and we&#39;ll talk about that a little later.
Then we have a role selector for selecting one or more roles, graded course rotations that you can select and search and you can add these, and the count that we&#39;re seeing here is the number of rotations that are linked to this graded course rotation.
So if we go look in metrics for each rotation, we have a mapping to the graded rotation, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re showing.
And I click Create, and once it&#39;s created, I can click Edit Status to change the statuses. Um, this is not showing all of the columns we want to, uh, Stick with this design that we have here.
Um. And then. ehm, ehm, ehm. The statuses that.
That&#39;s it. What we&#39;re going to have is, uhm, uhm, configuration. That&#39;s going to be when they do the setup. And then there&#39;s going to be capacity collections, preference collection, optimization, and, And, uh, review schedule.
It&#39;s going to be review schedule stage. And the final, um, uh, status is going to be, um, schedule finalized. So, they can use this button to update the status.
When they click the Manage Capacity one, it&#39;s going to take them to a page where they can enter, um, the capacity.
And it&#39;s going to look like this. So we&#39;ll have, Graded course rotation showing up. And it&#39;s going to show whether it&#39;s a required course or, uh, or elective.
And then you can click to expand this accordion. We&#39;ll skip this Manage Course Constrain section here. And then underneath that graded course rotation, it&#39;s going to list out every site that has a relationship to this graded course rotation.
And the way that it, It works is each graded course rotation here is linked to a rotation, and that rotation is linked to a site.
That&#39;s how we get this data on this page. Um, and then you can, uh, we can ignore the hub for now, and then there&#39;s a capacity field.
Um, and then we have students currently scheduled, um, here, which is supposed to show. Any students, um, I mean, let&#39;s see, we&#39;ll skip the student schedule for now, and we&#39;ll add that later.
Um, so, when you click on the greater course rotations, it&#39;ll expand and show you all of the sites. When you click on a site.
It&#39;ll expand and show each rotation, and then it&#39;ll show all the blocks from that block schedule we selected. So, if we go to clinical schedules, a clinical schedule.
We&#39;ll have blocks on it, and when we created that optimization, we had chosen this schedule that we want to optimize for, and it&#39;s simply pulling up these blocks that we have on there.
And then, umm, rotation, internal medicine. So these are all the rotations that are mapped to this site. This site is mapped to this graded course rotation, and these are all the blocks that are on the block schedule that we chose.
The optimization. Here, I can enable or disable each block, and if it&#39;s enabled, I can set a max and a min.
I can also come up here and set the maximum capacity for each. Umm, site. So remember, when we created this, umm.
Up. out. I had- I can choose whether I want to define it by site, by block, or by site and block.
So in this screenshot, what we&#39;re doing is, I&#39;m hiding or showing the ability to set capacity based on that selection.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3ebfeb8b2c224df9bd530fb31f296d05</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Decision Making Process Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>Is that, uhm, in terms of, uhm, eh, the, uhm, the team&#39;s decision to not move forward with the Switch, is that, how much, well, if it was due to pricing?
I think we did play a part of it, not, uhm, I mean, we did the set pricing, but Yeah, I mean, but, yeah, I mean, it did come up, and it did cause us a whole lot That wasn&#39;t, like, the focus, per se, uhm, I don&#39;t think that was, I mean, it was a factor, I mean, everybody, you have to consider prices,
but I don&#39;t think it was a huge, huge thing. Uhm, because what you offer, I mean, you get what you pay for a lot of times, so we, we do see the value that you, you know, offer, so, but I wouldn&#39;t say that was, like, a killer or anything like that.
Okay. In, in terms of, uhm, if there, uhm, is there any, uhm, anything, like, in terms of, uhm, because I remember us, uh, spending, uh, quite a bit of time on the, the clinical, or the reporting side of things and how it was, it&#39;s not, it wasn&#39;t only the, uh, the time, it was not getting the quality
of the data, uh, from, you know, uhm, because, and I&#39;m, and I&#39;m mainly asking, you know, for my own sake of, uh, you know, understanding in the future for other conversations that we may have or even with other institutions of if there&#39;s a way that we could, uhm, uhm, communicate the value better to
the team to, uh, because I, in, in, in, redistribution of the work is important, obviously, so that work gets done.
It&#39;s better but I feel like, yeah, with the technolo-, with the better technology, that is also, that&#39;s going to go so much further if you are going to be building new processes.
Right, and then, and also, you know, when we communicate with 145, obviously, I mean, obviously it creates a, yeah, so then they, you know, they counter, right, and then they, well, let&#39;s do this.
Here&#39;s what we have to offer. Let&#39;s, perhaps, uh, revisiting, uh, the processes or look at maybe the future that you&#39;re not using, or how can we improve it, and how that we&#39;re with acuity, we have a bigger team.
So they also have to have, uh, a response, you know. Okay, got it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That was another factor where the kids kind of create this urgency on their part to say, hey, well, we want to keep you.
So what, what can we do? Where are we lacking? Okay. And then they. . . And then the conversation becomes okay, well, this is why we&#39;re looking out for this is what has happened.
Um, and now, of course, you may anticipate, they want to revisit these things and . . . No, that&#39;s, that&#39;s very helpful. It&#39;s, I mean, I, and I actually think that, that is the right approach, because .
. At the end of the day, uh, we want to have a long-term relationship with organizations, and the, the, uh, the organization should be ready to switch.
You know, you don&#39;t want one or two individuals to make a decision and move and then everybody else is . And they go, why didn&#39;t we do this before?
And then, then, then it becomes a struggle to implement new processes. So, uh, I, I think it is good to, um, have that conversation because I, I actually thought that may have happened already when we started discussing it because you mentioned that they, they were, um, you guys were talking about looking
at the analytics and. And they had, you had to pay for a software software system. Um, do you look at the, so I thought maybe this, this internal discussion with the, the existing vendor has happened and the, that option has been exhausted.
Um, so since it hasn&#39;t happened, I think it&#39;s a good thing to, um, have and see if there is, um, something that can be done.
And then maybe we can have another conversation in six months and saying, is this something that you have got the help that you need and are you happy?
If not, do we want to have another meeting? Yeah. Yeah. No, when they presented us with the analytics piece and then just the, and I will say for that piece that they had to offer, that was very.
I think how much it was, but it&#39;ll leave you on the bus. Like, no, you know what we like, what it does?
Well, some people liked it, some people did not, but the majority did. Um, but for the price, it was like, uhh, we&#39;re not gonna, we&#39;re not gonna do that.
I see. And I think that was the emphasis on some stuff. You know what, because they gave us this, we was equipped.
with. Yeah. Yeah. And then during the course the process and looking at other vendors and then, and then talking to 145 and then.
And then they&#39;re like, hey, well, let&#39;s, let&#39;s wait and let&#39;s just talk about this. Yeah, yeah. And then, and then out of the team, yeah, we wanted to make sure that everybody was comfortable with the move and that we had, um, buy in from everybody.
Um, but we were not a hundred percent, not everybody was 100 percent, but there&#39;s that with the others. Yeah. y&#39;all.
You know, so it was just an ongoing conversation. And in the end, it was, if I did, you know, on this, with POD.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, for me, that&#39;s, this is helpful feedback because that is not something that I typically ask, uh, organizations when we have these kind of meetings about whether.
by the whether you had talked to your current vendor and explored what options you have because I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s, that should be part of that procurement process because you don&#39;t want to go through all the planning and then have that conversation and then then have the team members say, hey, let&#39;s
revisit at that time. So it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a good thing that you&#39;re doing it for us. It&#39;s something from, uh, I&#39;ve learned something that I can do in the future with other institutions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0f0e73abdb2a48b0bbffd10262f4b867</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Enhancing the Lottery Page Features 🎉</pre></td><td><pre>On this page, uhm, when I&#39;m on the create site fields, when I create a site field, I want to add one more checkbox that says include include, uh, field in optimization export, similar checkbox, include field in optimization export, and then what we&#39;re gonna do is, on the lottery page, we&#39;re going to
be adding a download data button, and this is is going to show four different things that you can download, each with a separate CSV.
First one is gonna be sites, and umm, it&#39;s going to show site code, which in the back of the site ID, site name.
And any columns that have check box enabled for including data with the optimization data. So any custom fields that have that&#39;s enabled, it&#39;ll be included.
Download CSV, it&#39;ll show that. For subjects, this is, uhm, going to show a list of all of the rotations that is- So you&#39;ll see it with the optimization.
So, if I go to the Lottery page and- Go to Lottery. click edit, we have a bunch of sites that are included here.
Any site that&#39;s included will have rotations linked to it. And that&#39;s what we are exporting here with the rotation code.
It&#39;s basically to make that decision. Rotation name. Uhm. Actually, uh, in the final version we&#39;ll just call this rotation to make it clear.
And then site code. And, slots. 7 So slots are going to be coming from.
I know it&#39;s been bad. Here, you have slots getting added with start date and end date. And uh. So I&#39;m going to see if I can think of this support as well.
And, Um, we currently don&#39;t have, um. I&#39;m going to show you Thank you, bye.
We currently don&#39;t have, uh, block i, uh, block names, so we can just show this as, uh, start date and end date.

Let&#39;s go back Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a4cbe859f16c45a38e38d60d1226034d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sales Meeting Insights and Training Strategy</pre></td><td><pre>I accidentally closed that last one, but if I go to this sheet you can see I have one for questions, question asked by response, answered by title, meeting, a link to the meeting, and then second one is going to be for insight.
Same concept here, so if I look at this example, analyze the sales meeting and compile a list of questions that were asked where each question provided a concise answer, name of the person, and then I paste into the transcript in there, and what it did was it pulled out each question, who asked it, who
answered it, and then a concise answer. So if we do that for a lot of the sales calls from last year, we&#39;ll have a lot of insight into things that people are asking.
Okay. All right. And the second thing that I want to do is pull out insights that we can use for training, and for that I used this prompt where it said use the transcript to generate insights that can.
Create, that can be used to create a challenge, used by a challenger salesperson in future meetings, provide examples how to use it and prepare about a call for each insight.
So it did that, but then I was more more specific asked it to give it a topic, a challenger stage topic.
So this way, it&#39;s always going to give me responses in a specific format. So the first prompt at the top is for questions, the second is for generating these insights.
And what I like him to do for the insights is basically put this into a separate column. Challenge your statement.
So that this is something that he will run through every single major sales meeting that we had and we&#39;re going to keep doing this going forward also.
Some suggestions for you to set this up for him. Instead of giving him the prompts, it&#39;d be good for you to try this out yourself and then generate two GPIOs.
GPTs for him. Or you can do one GPT. And so like for example, let me do it in the web browser.
So, if I make a GPT, I can do something like this. account at a SaaS business. You will be given transcripts, sales conversations, or sales demos.
When provided with a transcript, ask which of the following. You should do, one, track, answers to, insights, and then, if, is selected, do the following, analyze the entire transcript.
All questions that were asked for each question. For each question. And. So that would be the first one. And then essentially do the same thing for the second one.
And you can try this. Try this out, make sure that it works, and then we can get him started. And what I&#39;m hoping that we can do is use this to train different team members on key things to focus on during the sales process.
So this document is already in the sales drive, I&#39;m going to send both of them to you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5bab83f300c347a2bf557529c277ec19</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating a Compelling Document for Healthcare Professionals</pre></td><td><pre>This, ah, page, ah, that tells a story, and it&#39;s going to, it&#39;s going to be one of the first pages that a customer sees when they open up this document, by the second page, is going to tell the story about metrics.
And at the top, we want to highlight our mission, which is to create an engaged healthcare workforce to save our lives, and the, ah, what we want to do is showcase this, and then, also, underneath that, have a little blurb that says, every person in healthcare, I mean, every person needs to end up in
a hospital or in a doctor&#39;s office at some point. What we want to do is ensure that the doctors, nurses, and, professionals that are working in that hospital is maximizing their time for patient care and not spending their time learning software or, uh, or struggling with, with, uh, uhm, uh, technology
. So, that&#39;s going to be where this arrow is going to be pointing at a little blurb, and then, underneath that, we want to showcase our team photos because we want to come off as a people-oriented company.
Uhm, and then, below that, we want to also highlight our expertise as a company and, and showcase that we have individuals on the company that are, uh, have multiple years of experience, uhm, practicing in healthcare or working in healthcare, uh, uh, administration.
And then, next sec, two sections is about our past and then our future. This section is going to showcase a timeline.
We don&#39;t want to do it this, this, the same way because we don&#39;t, we&#39;re not going to, it&#39;s not going to be interactive.
We want to show how, uhm, we&#39;ve been around since 2013, uh, have a few milestones and, uhm, and then leading up to today.
And then this will give, this leads to our future. What is our three year goals, five year goals, 10 year goals, 20 year goals.
And what we&#39;re trying to do is paint a picture of a company that has been around for a while. You know, we have a track record of being in the market for 13 years.
We&#39;re not a startup. And we also have a long term vision for the company, uh, of what we want to accomplish.
So if a medical school dean or someone is looking at it, I want them to take away our mission. The fact that we&#39;re a people-centric company, they&#39;re going to have a lot of individuals that they&#39;re going to be able to connect with and get value from when they choose to work with us.
And the fact that, uh, we have a strong past and a, a long-term vision for the company. And at the bottom, we&#39;re going to show that we&#39;re made in Philadelphia because initially we&#39;re going to be sending this to Philadelphia-based, uh, medical schools.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6c543f08d7344d5cad458b0058bafb5b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Extracting Sales Call Insights for Lei</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Shruti Wanted to send you this video so that you can work on a project for Lei Given that he doesn&#39;t have any knowledge base articles to write.
I want him to spend some time helping us with extracting useful information from our sales calls in the past so the First thing I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to add you to attention and when you create your account Don&#39;t use a Google sign-in simply create a password for now, and then once you log in You&#39;ll
have access to all of the old calls And then you can we can also share your password temporarily with Lei So that he can access it and then once he&#39;s done with this project You can change the password For what so when he when he&#39;s in here The actually Um, I might be able to I&#39;ll do that myself I said
i&#39;ll send you the password that you can use instead of us adding another account for now and once he&#39;s in here what I like him to do is Uh, we have 800 calls from the past Year in here And I like him to go into here and search for anything with the word consultation or demo Uhm, actually the best thing
is uhm hide external calls and then scroll Uhm, scroll through it Cause there are things like uh You know what?
I think it&#39;s gonna be more difficult for him to do that If he simply scrolls If he for anything with consultation or demo That will give him most of the demo and meetings that we had And once he has one of those calls, what I&#39;d like him to do is Let&#39;s say if I open this up There&#39;s going to be A little

So, going through, uhm, the current setup that we have, when you create a new issue, we have three different types of tasks that we can create.
There&#39;s feature, there&#39;s bug, and then there is, uhm, a task. If you go to feature, it has a standard template for the summary, uhm, the story points.
We also have a list of clients that we can choose, so which client requested the feature. Uhm, list of modules, and then we also have a template that we use, and then if I do feature, I mean a bug, similar.
which is a different template, but just like a similar approach. Essentially, we want the URL where the bug is happening, a loom video explaining what needs to be done, and acceptance criteria.
Uhm, and then we also have certain, you know, things like, uhm, story points is required, and then we also, and then in the planning session, uhm, let me see, oh, the planning, we can skip for now.
Skip this. Skip this for now. And then on the board, we have set it up as three different boards.
Um, the design board, we have all of the, uhm, backlog items. So this new is all the new things that have been added.
Uhm, then we have design candidate. These are the things that we picked out for us to work on over the next, uh, short term.
Uhm, in progress is for what we&#39;re actually in the process of designing. Then we have design review for the UI.
We have team to review and, and, uh, finalize design. Then once designs are ready, it goes in design ready. And then, uh, these are tasks that are ready for the upcoming sprint.
For the actual development team board, we have to do, in progress, needs changes, review, ready, and done. If something is put into review, it actually has several sub, uh, CAS statuses.
We have QA1. First, manual test, QA2, second, manual test, code review, and then ready. If something is, there&#39;s a bug, we move it back into needs changes, and then it goes through, uhm, the second round of, uhm, when you put it back into needs changes, it shows up back on the development board for the
developers to work on. So that&#39;s really our current process, uhm, uhm, it would be ideal if we can, uhm, set up linear so that maybe we have the engineer monitoring, and then we also have QA, and then we have, uh, design teams, and, uhm, tasks move back and forth depending on who is, uh, which status
is it. And then we also want to have that standardized list of, uh, clients and standardized list of modules, which I can get to you.
It would also be, uhm, well, yeah, I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s good, good for us to start.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d3d421695f794e959547faebabdc7259</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding User Functionality in Metrix Platform</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the user&#39;s functionality in our Metrix platform. So, first thing is, um. We have four different types of users, and we categorize them as user types.
And these four user types. Are faculty, staff, resident slash fellow, and student.
And each of these types have a separate portal that they have. And these are personal portals that allow them to do certain tasks, whether submitting evaluations, submitting case logs, viewing their schedules, and so on.
If you have a. The faculty logging in, they&#39;ll be directed at the faculty portal. Their student logging in, they&#39;ll be directed at the student portal.
These user types, um, are fixed, and they cannot be, uhm, added again. You can&#39;t add any more user types, so you can&#39;t remove these.
You can&#39;t park order it into the system. Within each of these user types, you can create various roles, and these roles can be customized by each.
Client. So, for example, if you are a medical school, you may have students that are MS-1, MS-2, MS-3, MS-4. If you&#39;re a residency program, you may have residents that are PGY-1, PGY-2, PGY-3, and so on.
So, the roles, uhh, are customized to each client&#39;s needs, the user types are fixed and tied to portals. When you create a user, you can give them A affiliation with a, uh, one or more departments.
These, in metrics, we call them programs. These, uh, departments, the, the user typically will have, uhh, a primary department of affiliation, and that&#39;s their primary affiliation, and then they have, they can have additional secondary affiliations with other departments.
So the idea here is, let&#39;s say I&#39;m a surgeon, and, uh, I&#39;m gonna be affiliated with my- my surgery department, but I may also work with the emergency room, and I can have a secondary affiliation with the emergency room- emergency room department.
Then, uh, users also have a profile photo, uh, different and fields for capturing various information such as first name, last name, first name, middle name, last name, title, uh, previous name, email, secondary email, CC email, office phone number, personal phone number, work phone number, pager.
Umm, identification number, social security number, or SIN number. And then they would also have a home institution field, which is a drop-down.
And they list out all of the different sites that are in the platform. It&#39;s-it tells, uh, determines which, uh, hospital or, uh, university they are enrolled in, or if- employed by.
They would also have an activation date. That would be the date that they are able to use the platform and email notifications are working from that day onwards.
There&#39;s a class of year or this would be the expected graduation year. Birthday field. Uhm, for a place ethnicity with a list of ethnicities, gender dropdown field, marital status dropdown field, address one or address two with cities.
State, zip, country, and then a second address with address field one, address field two, city, zip, state, country. A, additional in for, uhh, uhh, long text field, the languages field, emergency contact info section, with ability to capture first name, last, uh, name, phone number, uhh, email, and
relationship for two emergency contacts, and then. Within the users field, you can also create custom fields, so, essentially, they can go in there and create, uhh, .
. Short text fields, or long text, or just, just say, text fields, uhh, multiple choice, or checklist. And when you create those fields, you can determine whether it&#39;s editable by the end user, or is only an admin fee.
And if it&#39;s a, uh, when you create a field, you can also say which user types it&#39;s available to. Another thing, uh, uh, for these earlier, we talked about affiliations, primary.
Secondary affiliations, uh, when a person has a, is, um, a user can have a status of whether they&#39;re active or inactive in the system.
And in addition to that, they also have an active or, inactive status for affiliations. If a user&#39;s affiliations are all inactive, then their user status is also becomes inactive.
If an affiliation, if at least one affiliation is active, then they&#39;re also becoming, active. Uh, users are also invited into the platform.
So, we track whether a user has been invited and not invited, and it&#39;s the last time they logged in. Uh, we also wanna store where the user elast- was in the platform, so they log back and again, they&#39;re taking to that same page.
For users, uh, we also- that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/61e5b1b5eef243cba0f1005dc13b4e87</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Requirement Management with Tags</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So what she&#39;s talking about is on the institutional portal and the admin portal, if you go to requirements and go to templates, when you create a requirement, it&#39;s going to show up on this active and inactive list.
Problem is, if places like Garnet that have has, like, 30 different items for onboarding. And then let&#39;s say they have another 30 items for, um, offboarding, then everything shows up in this one long list and it gets very confusing.
So I, um, had a similar, uh, similar challenge that I was trying to solve where they may have residents that are starting, which has one set of onboarding and they may have medical students with another set of onboarding items.
Some items may overlap. Um, so what I was thinking is, we can solve this using a tags feature. So, When we create a, um, um, a task here, we can also have a way to tag it and it&#39;ll show tags in a separate column and let&#39;s say we want to assign all of the ones, um, all of these assignments to a specific
individual or a group of individual, we can have a way to say assign requirements and on that page we have a way to select a tag.
Um, and all requirements that are tagged with that will be assigned in one batch. Um, so that they can have as many tags as they want, and then it&#39;s a way to group or categorize these items into their use cases.
So they may have one for onboarding, one for off boarding. Um, one for residents, one for students, and some of the students, one will overlap with the residents.
Um, and it kind of had the same approach with user groups. Remember we added a way to tag. Umm, groups, group tag.
This let them, um, use these groups in different ways. And we added a way to manage tags at the top.
So the same, same idea. Here. I think that will help solve the problem for them. And then even on the status page.
We could add a filter for a tag and it automatically selects all the requirements that meet that criteria. And then on the assignment.
And page. Same thing. A drop down. Do select the tag. One or more tags.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9e92cb30d2d349c695da8e232ff54636</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>AI-Generated Evaluation Forms for Medical Residency Programs</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so what I&#39;ll show you is, uhm, uhm, is the ability to create these custom GPTs. So, if I go in here, when I, when I&#39;m logged in, I click this button, my GPTs, it&#39;ll show you the GPTs that I&#39;ve created.
And then one of the GPTs in here is going to be the ACGME Milestone Evaluation Generator. And this one I&#39;ve I wrote this for one of the webinars, but the idea behind this is I can upload, I go to ACGME&#39;s website and I go to my milestones, and milestones by specialty, I can download any one of these PDFs
and let&#39;s say cardiovascular disease. And on the milestones page, it gives you the milestones for cardiovascular. This is showing you patient care.
This is the first sub-competency of patient care and the different levels. This, this GPT is, is built in a way that I could download this and upload this PDF, and then I can use this PDF to generate PROM, I mean generate a PROM evaluations.
So, the way that, if I, I&#39;ll show you what the actual code looks like, or the PROM looks like, so it says, pretend to be an experienced residency program director.
You&#39;ll be provided with PDFs containing ACGME milestones and asked to create evaluation forms. So the task is to first extract the subcompetent competencies, draft the evaluation questions, create clinically relevant questions as concise, unless otherwise specified, draft 10 Likert scales, and then include
one comment question at the bottom, map those questions that you write into those subcompetencies. So it&#39;s supposed to do all of this.
So, for. For, um, Monterey, they have, so if I go to the Monterey, um, let&#39;s see, I go to the drive folder, client onboarding.
Mm. On boarding projects, University of Monterey, and then, um, client upload folder evaluations. This will give us all of their different, uh, specialties.
Okay. And then, what we want to do is create- We create evaluation forms for each of these, because they want to start from scratch with new evaluation forms.
And instead of waiting for them to write it, we&#39;re gonna use AI to write it, and then have them just review it.
Yeah. So the way to approach this is, let&#39;s say I&#39;m working with cardiovascular. of your vascular. Disease. And I&#39;m gonna just go into the ACGME&#39;s website and just download the ones that we need.
Yeah. Cardiovascular. I&#39;m gonna do emergency medicine. Save that. Pediatrics. And then pediatrics subspecialty because anytime.
time. You have, uh, Pete&#39;s ICU or something. It&#39;s a subspecialty of pediatrics. Um. So, um, Let&#39;s save it.
Then we have internal medicine and OB-GYN. So, internal medicine. And, uh, stretch tricks. And gynecology. So, what I think that something, this is something you can work on over the next couple of days.
Um, it, and, and something like this, um, I&#39;m also like this. So, we had a non-boarding peeling. Now- And we have tasks for the on-source onboarding meetings.
And, um, what we can do is, um, have Katie add these to the current sprint. Okay. So this way, it&#39;s, uh, um, it&#39;s not, it was not determined last week during when we sprint started.
Yeah. But we&#39;re gonna have to add it for this week. Um, so the way that I would approach this, again, this is completely new methodology.
So we&#39;ll have to, if you have any problems, we&#39;ll have to troubleshoot. Yeah. And, hey, how you doing? Yeah. Can you in touch?
Yeah, I can do that. Thank you. Just need some more time. Oh, okay. Just tell me your last name. Chariot.
Let&#39;s see. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So, so let&#39;s say I was, I&#39;m gonna work on the internal medicine one.
Okay. What I would do is come in here and, Download internal medicine milestones, and then attach it.
So, attach. Internal medicine. And then what I can do is, uhm, I will be, I will need to create evaluations for internal medicine residency.
Program to evaluate, uhm, different residents of all academic levels in different clinical.
settings, on their competencies. These will be completed by faculty members at the end of a rotation, Uh, create a list of evaluation forms.
Would be. Cover. over. Years of training. So, this GPT was built to dump out one f- form. But what I&#39;m trying to do now is, uh, I was gonna give them one form on the call.
That&#39;s what I told them, but they were saying how they need to have different forms for different settings. So if they&#39;re doing an inpatient rotation, they may want to do a different forms in an ICU rotation, then an emergency retis medicine rotation.
So I want to see if the AI can 2. 3. Come up with the different types of forms that we need.
Okay. And then if it gives me those forms, then I can say, create the first one, create the second one, create the third one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bf00ee167bab40eb957c47eb01367785</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design Workflow Overview</pre></td><td><pre>We&#39;ll have a quick review of the design board and how to use the different columns. Anytime we have a new feature task being created it&#39;s going to end up with the status of new.
This is going to be the, essentially serve as an inbox of anything that is created during the week. And then we&#39;re going to review what&#39;s in new and assign an impact level or refine the impact level and effort score which is captured in this, in these story points.
Then it&#39;s going to either move forward into design candidate if we&#39;re going to be working on it in the near future, in the next three months if it&#39;s a project that we want to release in the next three months, it&#39;ll go into design candidate.
If it&#39;s something that is lacking context, so for example, every, uh, new feature that&#39;s added to the new column should have a loom video.
If it doesn&#39;t have a loom video, it goes to needs context so that the person that added the issue can watch and provide more information.
If it&#39;s something that has enough context and we decide that it&#39;s not going to be a priority for the next three months, then it&#39;ll go into the backlog.
So every issue, uh, from here, we have the capacity to transit, transition to the backlog and it falls off the board.
we&#39;re going to review the backlog and pick out things that we want to work on and put it into candidate.
So once an issue is in candidate, this is something that the designers, uh, mainly Mike is going to start working on the design using the loom video and he&#39;ll put it into in progress once he starts.
Once it&#39;s in progress, it&#39;s going to be, uh, not be discussed in the meetings, um, until it gets to the design review phase.
The design review is going to happen during the UX meeting on a weekly basis where we go through each of the items in here and make a decision on whether it&#39;s approved or not.
For specs and ready to be, uh, added to the upcoming sprint, or if it&#39;s something that goes back to in progress for it to be, uh, tweaked up.
And each UX meeting will involve reviewing this, uh, design review. That&#39;s the agenda. And then, um, secondary last, uh, agenda item for the UX meeting would be to provide feedback on any items that are in new to make sure if the, uh, the team has, uh, trouble, uh, assigning a priority to this during
the regular weekly review. But the main item that we&#39;ll be focusing on is going to be this column, which is a design review during the UX meeting.
Then during the sprint planning meeting, the agenda will be the upcoming sprint and going through and picking out items for the next sprint.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7a8c3348ef1a4b759ab5dcba59b552a2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design Workflow Updates for Lottery Page 🎨</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So, I had a, uh, I had a look at the, uh, design that you had sent me through GBC Engineer, and I, uhm, the, some of the, uh, workflows, I understood, some of it I wasn&#39;t really clear on, uhm, so I wanted to start with a wireframe to explain the, uhm, uhm, what I was thinking, and then then
you may be able to incorporate what you worked on into this, or vice versa. So, starting with the lottery page itself, we, don&#39;t, uhm, want to redesign all of it, because then it&#39;s just going to take a lot longer, uhm.
So, I, I took a screenshot from there and added some notes here on this video. For example, for statuses, we can use a bootstrap label, uhm, use green bootstrap label for closes with date and time.
Uhm, I want to completely get rid of the faces functionality. From the front end and the back end, because I find it very annoying and useless.
Uhm, instead, keep it simple. So, and also, instead of lottery, we call it, we&#39;ll call it optimization and then say it new optimization.
And it brings up a model, just like the ones that we have right now, but instead of, uhm, uhm, what we, the thing we&#39;re gonna give it a name, and I have two open date and end dates here.
This first capacity Any collection open date and end date is the same. It&#39;s going to be for them to collect the capacities for each of these sites from different hospitals.
And then there&#39;s a preference collection open date and end date. This is the existing functionality where we, uhm, have the, you know, Rio called it open date and end date.
I was being more specific because that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing is letting the students enter the preferences. And instead of the run date, call it optimization date.
Uh, select roles to include. It&#39;s going to be the drop down where they can select the roles. Uhm, here we also have, instead of them having to manually create these blocks, they will have a drop down where they can select one of the block schedules in the system.
And then, down here, it&#39;ll say, how will capacity be determined? It&#39;s going to be sites, blocks, or both sites and blocks.
So, right now, in the existing lottery, we let them define it by blocks. So, you can say, start date, end date, and then you can say how many students are allowed.
allowed to be in there. Uhm, but, for some of our clients, they define the capacities on the site level. So, it says, NYU can have 50 students.
And then, down here, we could, uh, we&#39;re going to keep the same site selection functionality that we already have. Then, that will, they&#39;ll click save, and they will create it, and they&#39;ll show all the details on this table.
And then, instead of the phases, we&#39;re going to have three, uhm, buttons here, uhm, manage capacity, update pre-fills, and collect preferences.
So, manage capacity will bring up this page. Which is the lottery blocks page, and here, uhm, what I have here is site A, B, C, D, and then you can click to expand it.
And it will show the list of rotations that are going to be at that site. And, uhm, site administrators, which, whatever, it&#39;s coming from the site&#39;s record.
And then you can see block. So, these blocks are coming from the block schedule that you selected. Remember, in the block schedule, in the current functionality.
You can create blocks. So, when you&#39;re clearing a new optimization or a new lottery. It&#39;s allowing you to select one of those block schedules.
And then, this allows us to have these blocks already displayed on the page. When they get here, and here, I could click on, if, let&#39;s say I chose sites as the capacity is being determined, then I would only see, min and max being defined on the site level.
If I chose blocks, then I would not see min and max for the site, I would only see the min and the max for the blocks.
And then, if I chose both, then I&#39;ll see what I&#39;m seeing here, which is min and max for each of these.
And I also have a batch update, but, but here, so if I choose a bunch of these and say batch update, I can put in the min and max and it&#39;ll set it for the whole, all of them.
And then the pre-fill page, we want to use the existing functionality that Rio has built. It works, uhm, the only changes that we want to make here is when I am putting, I can click on edit.
I can people into the blocks and then I can see who I have added, so it&#39;s going to say five people added and it&#39;s, the cell is red because I am over capacity.
This is showing the min and the max, I&#39;m over capacity. This is, uhm, I am under capacity, so I guess yellow, and then I&#39;m, if I&#39;m within the capacity, then it&#39;s green.
So this is existing functionality, the only thing that we&#39;re changing. is the color coding and showing the names right on the page.
Right now Rio only shows five students, but it doesn&#39;t actually show the name, last names of the people. And the other thing that, uhm, I was trying, I didn&#39;t finish this, was viewing the preference.
So on the student side, we don&#39;t really have to change anything, the existing preferences, page really works, uh, works well.
But on the admin side, we don&#39;t have a way to view the preferences that was entered by the administrator, sorry, by the students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/17119d8ae48443e5b96cde5f266c19fd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Course Page Updates 📝</pre></td><td><pre>Hi everyone, I&#39;m going to go over this new course page, made some updates to it. The first thing I want to cover is the layout.
So you can find the course, courses, uhm, board under growth ops, and there&#39;s a backlog section, then there&#39;s this column.
For milestones, essentially, any course that we&#39;re working on will have one task in here. That&#39;s for the parent milestone, and then there&#39;s going to be subtasks.
And as those subtasks are ready, it&#39;ll be moved to to-do. And then I&#39;ve created three columns for the, uh, uh, three people that will help with the review and, uhm, and, uh, uh, essentially review and add additional resources to these, uh, uh, course sections.
So, the first, just do one more thing here. I&#39;ll do one more here at the end.
And, essentially, what we want to do is go through a process where Tammy can look at it first, open it up, read through it, and as you&#39;re reading through it, I recommend And, looking up any additional, uh, information that, that is not clear.
So, this is basically something that was generated with the help of AI, but it may not be perfect. We want to make sure that if there&#39;s additional information that&#39;s, that&#39;s not that can be, we can add here, it&#39;s going to help us, uh, improve this training course.
So for example, as I was going through it, I found a YouTube video that will be a good addition here and I put that in here.
And if you want to make any changes to this, you can also use AI to do that. Where, explain this, summarize this, uhm, or you can even go.
So, for example, we can do that to enhance this, uh, copy. And, if you feel like we could, uhm, use a table or something in here, uhm, you can insert table, if you, if you like.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/89186b956200455d84b1ea8f51407a4e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Enhancing User Experience with Metrics.ai 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike.

. That way, there&#39;s less clicking involved. And the other thing that we want to be able to do is click all of, uh, click a bunch of them and have a batch Metrics.ai button that&#39;ll bring up a multiple modal where they will have a few check boxes to select what changes they want to revise.
So for example, fix typos, fix incomplete sentences, fix, uhm, uh, uhm, fix, uh, uhm, uhm, remove nicknames. So those are the things that we can have it Change, uh, update.
And then the other piece of this is, uhm.
We also want to have a little tooltip that shows what the changes were. So a tooltip will say, what are the AI edits?
Uhm, and then we can also show, sentiment as positive, negative, uhm, or neutral.
And uh, I think for that we can just have a little bootstrap badge of red, green, blue. Uhm, or grey.
And then if you hover over that, it also shows elements contributing to the sentiment. And, and sentiment can also be a checkbox that comes up in the modal.
For what they want to, uhm, run the AI for. Uhm, actually, it might even be easier if they have a little button at the top that says, uhm, Configure AI Assistant.
And in that, they could, uhm, Specify what things do they want to use, whether it&#39;s fixing typos, fixing grammar, fixing incomplete sentences, and, uhm, Uh, uh, sentiment analysis.
So they, they configure all that, and every time they run the AI, it&#39;s going to update that for each comment.
So I think this is something that we can do, uhm, separately.
separately. The grades part, But the comments, we&#39;ll do that part of the same task.
And then this also looks great. So, uh, I think what we need to do for this particular task is break this up into, uh, into like where it would go in the system and use like a Figma design to show that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/00afe1e26b6c4d9abd2719a62e363a13</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>App Update Feedback</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m looking at the app and in terms of the UI, it looks a lot cleaner and thank you for all the updates that you have made.
One thing that I noticed is when I&#39;m logged in as one of the institutions, I&#39;m able to We&#39;ll see. all of the users in the app, even the ones that are not, um, part of this institution.
so we should only be seeing users that are part of whatever, like right now, if I&#39;m logged in as Harvard, then I&#39;m able I would see myself, but if I add other people, then those individuals will be visible, but they would not be visible to administrators of another institution.
Um, so that was the one of the main things that I noticed. The other challen- thing that I&#39;m trying out here is, I&#39;ve loaded this book into it, it&#39;s a pdf.
It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried something this big, it&#39;s a very large text book. And then, I asked some questions, and one of the things that I&#39;ve noticed is, uhm, so I go down, so like, I was asking it to create a quiz.
Instead of doing that, and then once it&#39;s done, I got, uh tried doing it again, it did something strange all of a sudden.
It started responding in, looks like Arabic. And then I tried answering that, and it says, give me this formatting error.
I need to watch my hand while I&#39;m doing this to Down here. Yeah, like that. Push it in It&#39;s smooth.
I see you. I put it on there. So this is what you do when you go down. That&#39;s mom. Do you want to go down?
So I wonder, maybe I&#39;m not setting up the number of uh Oh, maybe it&#39;s the message history. But I, I still, I&#39;m not sure why it turned into Arabic.

So right now if I go to our current fields, if I select something I can simply click this to clear it, an X, but here if I select something, I have to go click the drop-down and select this, which is a lot, which is not ideal because it, it adds to it.
an extra click and then finding this option to be able to clear it. And for the graded course rotation, we should allow for multi-select.
The groups doesn&#39;t seem to be working. And then uhm. For has objectives, yes, no, uhm.
I think a a uhm Another way for that we can do this with less options here will be Only show courses With and then we can have two chapters check boxes so that it shows objectives and then sessions.
So essentially only show courses with and it would show objectives and then the second. So if they turn on one objectives, it&#39;ll show all the ones that with this one.
And if they check the second one and also show so it can. It&#39;s basically two check boxes instead of six radio buttons and they can just toggle it on and off.
That would simplify this and we can put that as a. Uhm? Uh, on the left side. It would also be ideal for us to have a clear button so that we can clear all these options.

And currently, when we import that, let me just make sure that, when we import, uhm, It&#39;s going to contain, ,rotation name, start date, and end date.
But, when we look at the evaluations that are imported, it&#39;s not getting associated with a block schedule or a user schedule.
So, we&#39;re, they&#39;re simply seeing the rotation name, and the rotate, uh, graded course rotation that it&#39;s linked to. But we actually, actually need to have in the system is a corresponding user schedule record that this evaluation is associated with, because if, uh, if the student completed this rotation
last year, they need to know that. So, what we want to do is add a column here. Called block schedule name, and, uhm, when we import, and I would also add the rotation code for, for, uh, completion sake, which would allow them to define this, not just the rotation name, but also the rotation code, uhm
, and, when we import this, what we want to do is, whatever the schedule name is, we&#39;re going to attach, we&#39;re going to create a, a user schedule assignment that is linked to that schedule, which in the back end is called program schedule, and then using the start date of the rotation, we&#39;re going to
select which block to link it to, because the relationship between the user schedule to the program schedule is using a block.
User schedule is linked to a block, block schedule is linked to a program schedule. So, if we look at the start date, we&#39;re going to use that to pick which block it is, and then, once we have that block, actually, the other way, actually, we&#39;re gonna pick the, we&#39;re gonna, uhm, program schedule first
, because we need, because each block is linked to a program schedule. Iimport, we parse through that, the data, select the program schedule, then, using the start date, we pick the block within that program schedule, and then, we select, we attach this rotation to that program schedule and it will be
at the block and put it the start date and end date into that user schedule. That essentially would schedule that rotation, and we can leave that as an unpublished schedule and use and create that link between the evaluation assignment and that newly created rotation assignment.
Uhm, so then we will be able to show the dates for these rotations. Uhm, to show that in a diagram, when we import, we want, what we want to do is create this.
But to create that, we&#39;re going to use the block name. The schedule name that is on the import file. Find that in the system.
Use the start date of that rotation, which is also on the import file. To pick the block. And then, attach a new unit.
User schedule assignment to that block. And then, create the evaluation assignment that we want to import, uh, and response. And that is going to be linked to this newly created user schedule.
That&#39;ll give us the full data necessary to have the schedule. And the evaluation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4c8a75dfbf394c07a78a13e2b24b6597</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Enhancing Document Editing and Approval Process</pre></td><td><pre>Both of these, uhm, StudentView and the AdminView, so the first thing, uhm, uhm, I think it&#39;s, I think, I, I, for this one, uhm, this is also like 90% there, so.
Well, depends on how we approach this. I&#39;m thinking about how to simplify this. So at the top, let&#39;s start with the top here.
Instead of Program, we want to use a template filter here. So we will show the slide. We will that is available in the system.
For Groups, it&#39;s fine, we also want to make sure it&#39;s searchable, like the existing fields. Statuses, fine. Users, we&#39;ll have first name, last name and role listed here with searchable.
and then for, Down here, uhm, when you are, when we are editing the document, uhm, I don&#39;t know if uhm, well, I think we can add the comments functionality, but we also want to add a way to add.
edit the source data. So, for example, these notable characteristics were pulled from some field in that user&#39;s demographics. So, if a user, admin goes in here and changes this letter, then that original data is still showing the wrong information.
So, to avoid that, what we can do is do something like this, where it will show those original fields on the right side, and they can go in there and make edits.
And when they&#39;re done with those edits, we can have a button at the top that says Regenerate Letter, and it&#39;ll regenerate the letter with the new source data.
So that way, everything is clean. Uhm, we can also, we can still have the comments, so it will be, uhm, update, uhm, source fields as one tab on the right side, and the second tab can be for comments.
Uhm, and then for comments, we also want to have a way to, uhm, nah, I think we&#39;ll leave that for now.
Uhm, so, if it&#39;s on the admin portal, update source fields, and the comments, if it&#39;s on the student portal, just the comments is fine.
And then the approved, uh, document, I don&#39;t think we should introduce that yet, because we only have a one way, uh, a way to set statuses.
So, if I&#39;m approving it, what I will be doing is moving it to the next status, and someone else may be approve it, and they move to the next status, because there may be multiple approvers.

Is that scheduled in advance or does he have a calendar? And I&#39;m asking that because my schedule varies. Okay. Okay.

Like, how does that list translate to, like, uhh, me ordering food? Yeah. No. Yeah. out. Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay.
Umm. Umm. Umm. Okay. No, nothing else. I&#39;ll see you in the next video.
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a while thought our plan. In terms of the mobile app, uhm, is that the uh, So, one of the things that I use now regularly is, uh, the, uh, Peloton, uh, I mean, we have the Peloton, uh, the, the threat on the bike, and I&#39;ve also been using the Peloton strength app.
If I want to, Uh, what I really like about the strength app is it allows me to, uhm, it&#39;s very easy to use it intuitive and, like, quick for me to log things in there.
Um, is what I found with a lot of the, perhaps out there, when it comes to logging, it&#39;s a pain in the butt to, like, sit-click in there and type in, like, every single weight.
Um, the Peloton has done a really good job with the how easy it is to enter. Is there a, you guys?
I think with, uh, any other workout apps like Peloton, if I want to do, uh, workouts from there and then having it sync.
Yeah. up. Yeah. Yeah. No. No.
Yeah. Or, like, I mean, I&#39;m- I&#39;m asking the tech questions.
I&#39;m a tech person. It&#39;s like, uh, so if- if I&#39;m getting a prescribed, uh, workout regimen that&#39;s personalized to me, do I still need to type in what I did?
Or can I- it just has it loaded so that I can just say I did it? Yeah. No. No. No.
Yeah. I mean, I&#39;m mainly looking as like, uh, logging has been a big weakness of mine. And I, because it&#39;s just tedious to do.
And, uh, if it would have been, uh, if you don&#39;t already do it, it would be nice if in the app, I open it up.
And it already has it. What is the, what I, what I should be doing? And then I can adjust it if I didn&#39;t do it, or if I did more or less, instead of having to enter everything manually.
Because if you have ten different workouts, each of them have reps, each of them have weights. It&#39;s a just a lot of clicking to get it done.
And for me, that&#39;s been always been like a problem that I just get frustrated with, like, having to do that in between the workout.
But it would be nice if it&#39;s, here&#39;s what the coach said. And I&#39;m going to do that.

I looked at this issue with Tammy. Wanted to explain what is happening. Uhm, when we are importing a evaluation response, so when I click here, and import this, the import itself has the rotation name, but we are not creating schedules for this import.
Uhm, I don&#39;t know if this was something that we didn&#39;t do as part of it, or is this something intentionally left out.
I&#39;d have to talk to our team to see, uhm, the reason, but essentially, we have the rotation record, we have the dates here, but the dates are not getting populated into metrics, because in order for that to happen.
We have to create a scheduled rotation that it&#39;s connected to. Right now, what happens is it imports it, and then the imported evaluation has a relationship between the assignment, and the actual rotation record, and the rotation record, like this one here, has a link to the gradebook rotation.
That&#39;s why, on your email, you&#39;re seeing the rotation But, there is no schedule. So the question is, uhm, do you need to create all of these in these schedules when these, uh, uh, old responses are getting imported or is it sufficient to just have the rotation name?
Uhm, if it&#39;s sufficient to have the rotation name, then you can continue importing. If it&#39;s a requirement to have the standard name, the start date and the end date, then we could do an update where we, in addition to the rotation name, we also add a column for schedule.
Then, you would then create a schedule, uhm, and that schedule will be something that you put in here.
So, for example, you put an MAP-NE 2024 as, in the, into the column, and then when the import happens, in addition to importing the schedule, we&#39;re also creating an assignment for this evaluate T.
to be scheduled to that rotation with the start date and end date, and that scheduled rotation is getting linked to that imported response.
Then, when you&#39;re looking at the response, it&#39;ll show the dates, too. So, let us know your thoughts, and, uh, we can, uh, move forward appropriately.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/95f7494850654899a9383d2510960922</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Document Management System Enhancement Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>This is also looking great, uhm, the, at the top of the filters, uhm, we want to have groups, we want to have, uhm, statuses, users, so the users we want to show first and last name and the role that we have already have there, uhm.
And I&#39;m assuming, uhm, you&#39;re trying to make Maria happy with these ES, uhm. But instead of program, we can do a template.
It&#39;s a document template. Uhm, so I do like the four year review and MSPE, uhm. What we.
So. When we are previewing. Editing regenerate all of this is uhm so uhm.
I&#39;m going to comment on this. So this is this is great. I I think we could, uhm. This is really exactly what we need.
The only thing that, uhm, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ready to do this. But I&#39;m going to approve document because we only have the statuses drop down, uhm.
If we want to do approvals. I think we get to keep it simpler.
Instead of, uhm, approvals, uh, we can just have a way to up, update the status from one thing to the next. So, uhm, so that, uhm.
They can basically create a bunch of statuses and then when this person reviews it, they will update the status to the next status.
And, so we can just have a drop down at the top. The other thing that, uh, we want, we can add here, and I think the easiest way to do it is basically have two tags.
Uhm, one for comments, the other one for update, uhm, update source, uhm, update source fields.
And, uhm. And it would essentially show a bunch of fields and, uhm, let me show you what that may look like.
So, similar to something like this, on the right side, so it&#39;ll show different fields, so these are the fields that pulled in data to create this letter.
So, it&#39;s gonna basically list out different demographic fields, so that if they need to fix a typo, they can just fix it on the source data.
And then, it would update the information in the letter. Because otherwise, if they make the changes to the letter itself, the original source data, where they pulled this from, may be out of sync.
So, if we have to have this update source data, uhm, section, they can just make the change, and then regenerate the letter, and it will be all in sync.
So, going back to the document. I don&#39;t know where it is because I got too many windows open. So, update source field and comments, uhm, and And then if they change the data, we could also have a, button that says regenerate letter and then it would just basically regenerate the letter from, uhm, from
scratch and show the new changes. With the comments on that, we should be covering, all of the scenarios. And then, we could also use the, uhm, actually for the students, we could just leave it just comments.
We don&#39;t want the students to edit any source data. Uhm, we...admins can just look at that comments and make comments. But, it&#39;s the changes if they need to.
But, one of the things that on this page, we also want to show if there are any errors. Uhm, like how many, uh, comments there So that way, if they need to review something, they can go in there and, uh, uhm.
You know what? What?

So with that collapse button there or expand and collapse, we can move this down into the actual container in the card so it&#39;s not in the header.
And when it comes to searching I&#39;m not sure how difficult it is. If we simply let them search anything in the here, so if I start typing the uh the name of the group, I mean maybe not the name of the group because you can&#39;t see it, um but the type code um then they can just search it for anything and
filter by them. If it&#39;s easy, otherwise, if it&#39;s not easy, then we don&#39;t have to do that. Um, but one thing I did want to note was for session type, in our, in the curriculum setup, under session types, they have a way to define colors for it.
It&#39;ll be nice if we can use a bootstrap tag and use the same color they have defined when we show the type.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fdaa8b5a93174c3b8aa8a3e125078150</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Case Logs Overview (Everything except site level permissions + ICD Codes)</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this, uh, video, we&#39;re going to review the entire case logs module. I&#39;m not going to show all of it.
Some of it, such as email notifications and things like that, I&#39;m going to explain. To provide some context, let&#39;s start with, uhm, what this module is about.
What this to do. So, case, cases, or case logs module is what we call on the interface. Behind the scenes, it&#39;s called, uh, there&#39;s, it&#39;s called procedures.
because, When we first built this module years ago, it was built for the residency programs. Residency programs mainly log procedures.
And then when we started working with medical schools and veterinary schools, they have students that are logging not only procedures, but also diagnosis.
So the patients that these students see in the hospital. So we renamed it to cases in the interface, but behind the scenes, the models, I believe, are still called procedures.
So I&#39;m going to summarize this here. So case logging. All right. Let&#39;s see. Lock. Okay.
Cases. And cases have templates. And then templates.
Uh, there&#39;s also diagnosis lists and procedure lists.
Okay. Then, we have custom fields, and we have pre-built fields.
So, and we also have email notifications, and I believe we have SMS notifications, because if one&#39;s failed, I&#39;m not, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working yet.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s, it&#39;s been working. Uhm, and if we also, in the future, we&#39;ll have push notifications, email notifications.
Push notifications includes ability to, uhm, approve case logs without logging in.
Alright, so. Going into the system Under cases And, I&#39;m going to go through this In a, there are two different ways that our customers are using this module The older way that hospital clients are using it Is, uhm, if I go to a place like kp.metrixlab.com And I go to one of these templates You&#39;ll see
here, we have different templates that they have created for each of the different procedures they have to log. And when they create these procedure templates they define the minimum number they have to do, whether or not there needs to be And each procedure has a separate template.
The reason that we initially did it that way is because when we, when they submit these logs, there is something called minimum performance level.
and depending on what the minimum performance level is, and it says minimum required for credentialing, after they have completed x number, so after they have completed five cases, that the faculty member says they have performed without any assistance, then they&#39;re considered credentialed.
If they&#39;re considered credentialed, then they can supervise other, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, junior doctors to do that procedure. And in our system, uh, we have a page where they can go in there and look up a resident.
And see whether or not they&#39;ve been credentialed, and if they are able to do that procedure, uhm, on their own.
This functionality is the original way to do it, and there are clients that are still using it. Since we started working with medical schools, what we have done is, we have created something called Diagnosis Lists and Procedure Lists.
So we go into the, uh, these two tabs, and we can go in there and create a category. So the category has a category code or ID and name.
And then, once you have created a category, you could go in there and create, put a, put diagnosis with a code and a minimum a number into it, then you can do the same thing.
So we&#39;re defining that these are the procedures and these are the, uhm, diagnosis that we want them to do and how many of each of those we have to do.
There&#39;s a bit, there&#39;s a way for us to deactivate these if we don&#39;t need them. So there&#39;s an active and inactive status for.
Uh, diagnosis and procedure lists. So to recap, we have the ability to categorize diagnosis and procedures with categories having code and, uhm, a name.
We also have a way to, uh, create, uhm, procedures. Procedures with code, procedure name, and a minimum number.
We also have a way to create diagnosis with a code, uh, diagnosis name, and minimum. And then we also have a way to activate and deactivate procedures and diagnosis.
One thing to note here is the way that we are more often using these categories is to put them into rotation that they&#39;re going to be completing it in.
I think there may be a value in the future for us to link these categories to graded course rotations.
So in the gradebook setup, we create these graded course rotations, and if we put a relationship between the category and a graded course rotation, then we know which of these procedures and diagnosis is tied to a particular course or rotation, and then there&#39;s a value in doing that.
And keeping track of that, that&#39;s a nice to have. And then we also at the top for procedures and diagnosis, um, we have a way to import them into the system using a CSV.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a6042413c64749d080b7f50a251e000a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Custom Fields and Document Generation for Medical Schools</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so if I go to our server, we&#39;re gonna pick up on the institutional portal and we&#39;ve already have pre-loaded all of the the, uhm, merge fields that we think we need.

Uhm, one of the first things is custom fields. So, we want to make sure that we capture, ,custom fields that allows us to import a bunch of these demographic information into the system.
And you can see, we preload a bunch of these already, like MSPE score, uhm, we have noteworthy characteristics. Characteristic one, noteworthy characteristic two, I&#39;m going to also add noteworthy characteristic three.
Customized long text field for student and allow students to edit it. And then I&#39;m going to edit this first one to long text.
So, custom fields. Like we talked about last at the retreat is basically a way for people to enter information about a student that is beyond what we provide out of the box.
And they can add additional information. But this custom fields is also. We take data from outside of metrics like, um, what are the courses that they taught?
What are the MCAT scores? We can do a import and populate those information into metrics, and then, uh, then these custom fields are available to be used as merge fields for the document generation.
Uhm, so, so custom fields we define, then we have to make sure that every custom field that we create, we also create a corresponding merge field.
Because, actually, we automated that recently. It automatically, if you make a custom field, it would automatically make a corresponding merge field.
So we don&#39;t have to do that each time. Uhm, so. Then, what we do, we would do is go into the actual document template, and we&#39;re going to create an MSPE template.
So I&#39;m going to just. Let&#39;s Google for, actually I&#39;m going to go to, I have a MSPE template on this server that I&#39;m just going to copy.
The end. MSPE template. Select all. Copy. New template. Call this MSPE template. I&#39;m going to make this available to the School of Medicine since this is going to be for medical schools.
It&#39;s only for MS force because MSPE letters are only generated for the graduating class and I have not created a document type, so I just need to go back and create the document type.
So, I&#39;m going to create a new document type called MSPE letter and use only for student personal documents. It&#39;s not required and only one document per user, and then I will go to here.
So when we are creating the template, we&#39;re going to give it a name of AAMC. MSPE template programs. We&#39;re choosing to school of medicine role.
I&#39;m going to choose MSP, MS4 since it&#39;s only for fourth year students. Um, document category, we choose MSPE letter, which is meaning that once a document is generated, that&#39;s where we&#39;ll store it as an attachment in the student profile.
And then, do you want full editing permissions? Yes, we want the deans to be able to edit these letters after they&#39;re generated.
Then on the next page, um, what fields do we want to include? and I&#39;m just going to select. All of the ones except for the ones that we use for the contract.
So contracts and date, we don&#39;t want to start date. Really want to get rid of this page, because it&#39;s completely unnecessary that, Alright, so, now that we have that, uhm, I&#39;m going to paste this letter here.
And you can see it already has these things filled in, but I&#39;m just going to replace it with some merge fields.
So, for example, this one here, I copied it from a different server. Uhm, on this letter, there is some pre-filled merge fields, but it needs to match perfectly.
So here, I had to use the word, the pound in front of it. I just need to make sure that&#39;s correct.
And then, as we go down, there&#39;s a bunch of these fields. Uh, matriculation date, expected graduation date. I don&#39;t see that.
Okay. So, and then, but anyway, like, you kind of just update it based on what new fields you have.
So you the, this is an important thing to note here, uhm, the insert block. So, in your MSPE letter, you&#39;re supposed to show all of the grades that you got for your clinical rotations.
This includes the scheduling information, the, ah, the locations that you went to, the dates, the grades, and the comments, and the chart.
But if you think about it, a student will have, in a, in 30 or 6 or 7 core rotations. We don&#39;t want that to be added to the template one by one because they might do it in different order.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/162ee6119c184d54a2c2d61f870dfac6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Generating LinkedIn Post Ideas 📝</pre></td><td><pre>Let&#39;s pull up, uhm, attention for the, the demo that we did with, uhm, actually, Fathom, I think it was in Fathomware.
And it also doesn&#39;t need to be, like, others should be adding ideas. So far, I&#39;m the only one that has added stuff there.
Uhm, if I&#39;m going to be creating all ideas for product and for marketing, this is going to be a very slow and painful process.
Uhm, so copy transcript. I go into AI and say, this is a transcript and this can be turned into a GPT of a sales call we had with a message.
Medical School. It included all of their deans and provided an overview of the platform. review this transcript. and create 10 ideas for LinkedIn posts in the format of text, post carousels, and, uhm, infographics.
So, this would, last time I did this, I actually put in context of, uh, the, the messaging. Also, I said I want to have, uh, a post about, uh, in a, in a storyboard.
Storytelling format. Uh, I&#39;m, I&#39;m doing this quickly now just as a example. So, refine this. These are, educating. So, once I have decent ideas, then what I do is, Okay, but how do you know those ideas are decent?
So, this is, this is, uh, what I don&#39;t have time for. I need the marketing people to figure out if it&#39;s good ideas or not.
Yeah, so just give us the idea and we&#39;ll tell you if it&#39;s good. I don&#39;t know the idea, man. Like, No, just, just change your very first prompt to give me 10 post ideas with user stories.
So, And then that will be exactly what we need to make a good, But, but you&#39;re asking, what I&#39;m trying to do is teach you how to do this so that you can do it yourself.
Yeah, and I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;ve walked, like, you&#39;ve walked me through this and I can&#39;t do it myself, but when you give us this, what am I supposed to do then?
I, I, this was, the goal of this whole exercise is for you to observe and learn how it&#39;s doing so that I&#39;m not doing this.
Okay. So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been telling you the other day. It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t want to be doing this. I want, we, every day that I&#39;m doing these meetings, we have transcripts of it.
I want the marketing people to be able to take that and turn it into, uh, things. And I, and I want to do that for you, which is why I haven&#39;t actually said at any point during this conversation that you have to do anything.
You&#39;re the one saying that you have to do stuff. I&#39;m saying- But you&#39;re, yes, you did. You said go in there and write the user story and the idea.
I&#39;m saying, if you have, like, I can put ideas in there, sure. I, I&#39;m totally okay with doing that and I will do that.
But I&#39;m just saying that with the things we have in backlog right now, I&#39;m pointing out the confusion we&#39;re having with how these things were entered in and how they should be entered in for this process to work properly.
Okay, so, so here&#39;s what we can do. We can, uh, skip over whatever&#39;s in there that you guys don&#39;t have an idea of what to do.
And instead, go ahead and create it yourself. What I, the end result that I want is I want to be able to be posting three LinkedIn posts.
on my LinkedIn every week. So, but, like, the reason I&#39;m adding this here is it&#39;s not really getting done if, like, uh, I&#39;m not adding it.
So, as long as you guys want to do that, I&#39;d rather be focused on sales meetings and training meetings. Uh, but, you know, you have not really done LinkedIn posts before, like, you, that is, like, I&#39;ve been doing LinkedIn posts for a year.
So, there&#39;s, there are certain, uh, style that is being, that I, that I usually write in, and there&#39;s certain, uh, style that goes into LinkedIn posts.
So, the reason I was putting some of this together was because it&#39;s, it, there&#39;s a learning curve to writing LinkedIn posts.
So, if I&#39;m, if, if I&#39;m not going through that training of how to write these LinkedIn posts, it&#39;s, it&#39;s going to end up being like a blog post or something.
And, and I don&#39;t think the, the style that we&#39;re using on the company portal is the best way to write LinkedIn posts.
Okay, then, then, if, if you want it to be in a particular style, just use ChatGPT to put together a style example for us to always reference.
To make sure anything that we create is in that style. Yeah, so, we could do that. Instead of writing the posts, the, the, the posts for each item itself.
Okay, so, let&#39;s summarize, uh, what we&#39;re gonna do. So, uhm, what, and I already have that GPT that you have, should have, have access to, that I went over in that previous meeting, where.
I don&#39;t think I do. It should be in the company one. What is it called? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s see.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4c9824c8bbf14603bd6af9005a038675</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Engaging LinkedIn Posts 📸</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, everyone. I wanted to create this video to show you how I put together today&#39;s LinkedIn post. PJ had mentioned that there was a clip that was pulled out of the episode with Sarahi.
So I went in here and I found this clip. And one of the things that I did was I first listened to it.
And I noticed that it&#39;s a really good clip talking about our people, process and process. And platform methodology. In a recent webinar, we had put together this slide that highlights this process, this methodology.
And I wanted to use this image when I was speaking about it. So what I did was I went into this tool called VEED, imported that particular, uh, clip, and then I simply took a, a screenshot of this and I cropped out this section.
And I went into here and I pasted it in here, and then I went to the shape, and I put a shape behind it, that was just white, so that it, it, uh, uhm, if I take that out, you can, you&#39;ll see that, you can see through the, so I put a shape back there, and then I simply had it show up three times, each
time I met, talked about the people, process, or platform. And one of the things that Veed is doing also is creating the subtitles, and I&#39;ve noticed since the last time I used Veed, they have improved their subtitles so that it&#39;s not, uh, directly generating the subtitles with all of the flaws that you
have when you say something, so it actually cleans it up and makes it so that it&#39;s easy to read. to follow, so if there&#39;s ums and other things that you&#39;re saying, it removes it automatically, so it&#39;s really a, a clean subtitle.
And then for the style, I used a simple style that I have here and then exported it as a file.
So once I&#39;m done with that, then I wanted to put together a post for LinkedIn. So for that, what I did was I simply took, uhm, the new Mac, uh, OS, includes the ability to dictate and try to transcribe notes directly into notepad.
So what I did, I described the onboarding process. You can see enterprise on, uh, software is difficult. And then I talked for a couple of minutes, got this transcript and I went into.
Not drive, chat GPT and use my.
I got to use this one, I think. So if you&#39;re on GPT four, you can use the app symbol to pull up GPTs.
And I went in here and I pasted this transcript and had it write that post for me. Once I got into LinkedIn.
I uploaded the video, added the text, and clicked publish. One of the things that I did when I uploaded the video was I disabled the auto-generate subtitles functionality in, in, uh, LinkedIn.
Because I don&#39;t want LinkedIn to add subtitles on top of what I&#39;ve already created. So I was, I hope that was, uh, helpful.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e3859a137abc44128e31aa1d6f872e9a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Strategic Business Analysis Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>AltaMed, gone. ARH, I&#39;m not, they&#39;re not strategic. Let&#39;s see. AUC, uhm, AUC is one of, AUC and Ross is one of those, and RossVet, I&#39;m not going to consider them strategic from my perspective.
They are strategic for the company. But I&#39;m not, like I know that Chris has a handle on them, it&#39;s uhm, so not, I&#39;m gonna, uhm, I wonder if it&#39;s, if it&#39;s worth us putting that on here, because I think it may be, it&#39;s okay for us to put that now, but I, I, yeah, we&#39;ll take it out, like, like you and I
can, like it&#39;s, this is more of a personal strategic thing versus company. I&#39;ll put it somewhere else, but for now, that helps me understand this a little bit, because I was like, well, wouldn&#39;t that be strategic, like, if we want Chris to know forever?
So, the personas and the, like, mapping thing that we&#39;re gonna do, segmentation, segmentation stuff we&#39;ll do separately, this is just like us trying to figure out what are the ones that we, you know, folks are handling.
I don&#39;t want to talk to you to make sure he&#39;s not missing meetings for, Gotcha, so this is mostly for, like, your involvement.
No, I mean, there&#39;s a reason why I consider a certain one of these strategic, and I want Shruti to help manage, because I, like, there are certain ones that I, like, personally oversee, because of his impact, or because I feel like they&#39;re not, getting the attention that they need.
So, for example, AUC is strategic for the company, but I&#39;m not concerned about AUC, because every week Chris meets with them, and the Talim is always going to bring AUC, and Ross, and Ross Met, to the top of the list.
They&#39;re getting attention, like Chamberlain, on the other hand, is strategic for me, to my perspective, because a Talim doesn&#39;t prioritize Chamberlain.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1dcd34d4413a4919a54f226784f4ebaf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Merge Fields in Document Generation</pre></td><td><pre>On the Institutional Portal, we have the Documents Module, and the Documents Module is something that we built several years ago as a way to generate contracts for Kaiser.
And it&#39;s essentially a module that allows you to create these merge fields, and what we&#39;ll do is go through each of these merge fields.
So, merge fields are supposed to be similar to, like, I got the idea from Microsoft Mail Merge. If you go into Microsoft and you want to create an envelope, you can put in a merge field and then say, uhm, here&#39;s the envelope, first name, last name, address, and then you can import a list of addresses
and it&#39;ll populate it with those addresses so that you can print out labels and things like that. Same idea here.
You can say, I want to create a new merge field, and this is going to be a, uhm, text field.
Oh wait, sorry. I&#39;m not mirroring, hold on one second. Okay, so essentially, uhm, under doc image, in the institutional portal document, uh, uh, we&#39;re going to have merge fields.
So there are five different types of merge fields. So a new merge field, first one is a text field, which means that if I put this into a document, and I&#39;ll see you and then one of the administrators in the program portal is given access to that template, and you, uhm, have this field on that document
, they&#39;ll be able to type in whatever they want. It&#39;s just basically a text field that they can fill in. You can, You could also give it a select field.
A select field is basically giving them a drop down to pick something from. Uhm, so, for example, in a, in in the world of, world of contracts, you may say one of the select field is going to be, a list of titles and, and, for example, Kaiser, they would have a title field called, I mean, a select field
, PGY1, PGY2, they just type it in as these, these, uh, drop down options and then when it&#39;s any time a letter is getting generated or contracts was generated, the administrator will be asked what do you want to populate into this field?
And they can select PGY1, 2, 3, or 4 and when they select that, in the contract, it will say this is a contract for PGY1, residence, it will just populate it with PTEP, that text.
So the difference between a text field and a select field is text field, they can type in whatever they want.
And select field is also a text, but you&#39;re pre-filling it with options. Then a second type of. Select field is a dependent select field.
So, uhm, the idea of a dependent select field is you can have a second text entry that is getting added to this document, but.
It&#39;s entirely dependent on what you selected first and you cannot, as an administrator, you won&#39;t be able to manually pick what&#39;s on here.
So, this was mainly something I came up with at that time for contracts. So. So, you have a PGY1 has a different salary than a PGY2.
So, if you have the administrator of an internal medicine residency program may choose PGY1 when they still generate the contract.
And then automatically, it&#39;s gonna select, you know, $70,000 for their salary. So, you&#39;re not letting the administrator manually pick the salary.
It&#39;s something that&#39;s locked down across all of the heik&#39;s, uh, Kaiser departments. And they&#39;re simply saying, what, what trainee are you generating this contract for?
And what, what role are you gonna pick in the first field? And the second field would automatically be selected. And you can see here, if I choose dependent, I can say, which, is a dependent field, which is a dependent on.
Umm, and so if I go into Kaiser, for example, I&#39;m gonna go to kp.matrix.sg, and I&#39;m gonna log in, and if I go to their contract section, n h 0 3 and the institutional portal, merge fields, and, let&#39;s say, salary.
Edit, and you can say yes, and it&#39;s dependent on level, and then add values. We&#39;ll show you. So you say, if I choose this value, what is the dependent value?
If I choose this, what&#39;s the dependent value? So this function, The personality is really not used in the world of MSPE, uh, but it&#39;s mainly what&#39;s created for the sake of, uh, contracts, um, where you do not want each coordinator, uh, have, like, they have 200-some-a-coordinator across different- hospitals
, there&#39;s, uh, a lot of room for error if you&#39;re ha-manually plugging these in, they&#39;re not lawyers, they shouldn&#39;t be doing- they do- but they can&#39;t- they know who they&#39;re generating the contract for, and they just pick that and it automatically gets populated.
Yeah. I have one question. Yeah. Um, so, like, I&#39;ve realized that when we demo for the MSP module, we do say that they can, you know, add their own, uhm, fields.
So, of course, it tends to- and, like, have different ones, or are there, like, uh, a set of reloaded, uh, fields that we do for them?
Or is it only, like, talking to them and then adding the- the- Yeah, so that&#39;s a good question. So, for the MSPE, um, yes, we- so I&#39;m on a server called Ateneo.
This is a brand new server. You can see there&#39;s already 60 fields that are already preloaded here. So, uh, so the- these are preloaded.
Uhm, but yeah, for- for- for contracts, they- they would be mostly creating these as needed. Uhm, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so, yeah, go ahead.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6703f51c747e46828f57a9c1760b0577</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calendar Syncing and Troubleshooting Tools 📅</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, PJ, uhm, I figured it&#39;d be easier to explain it. Uhm, what you&#39;re as- I mean, there was two questions that you had asked.
One was about the calendar syncing to an external calendar. And then the other one was about whether there was tools to troubleshoot.
Both of those are good questions. The main point I&#39;m trying to make is, umm, the way you word those questions, umm, it- it came off a little bit as you&#39;re trying to poke holes at their product.
Umm, rather it&#39;s- you&#39;re gonna have a bigger impact on them. them. . Umm, realizing the problems for themselves, uhh, rather than us being so direct at pointing at their software.
Because if we try to point at their software and try to poke at- people are more likely to get defensive, umm, and defend their decision at whatever product they have, than for them to realize it.
So, for example, umm, ins- It&#39;s, Instead of asking, does the software- does that, you know, is there a way for it to sink with, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, ask the question in the context of a process.
You know, uhh, so how do uhh, uhh, you know, do the students have the ability to uhh, uhh, view their- The schedules from their- the mobile phones, or uhh, uhh, uhh, are there- is there a way for students to keep up-to-date, uhh, on real-time changes?
So it&#39;s- it&#39;s not necessarily asking about software functionality, but it&#39;s looking at it from the end result of the- of that.
The- the impact. And then, uhh, she may bring it up. Yeah, this is something that, uhh, they&#39;re not able to do because of the problem with the syncing, but then she&#39;s bringing up the software problems and she&#39;s realizing the issue rather than us trying to be, uhh, poking holes at it.
So the second one- I would word it as, you know, when- when you have, uhh, when there are, uhh, problems, uhh, how do you typically, uhh, troubleshoot, uhh, how do you- what&#39;s your process for, uhh, dealing with, uhh, scheduling issues, how do you go about making those changes?
So, they- I&#39;m hearing the same goal of extracting more information about how do they fix the thing, but I&#39;m not directly asking, does the- is there troubleshooting tools in their- in their software?
Um, so it&#39;s mainly using language that is more- control and process oriented so that, uh, they&#39;re the ones that are realizing the flaws.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/060c04f10080497b95ee754b407db2b9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Linear App 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll briefly go over how to use Linear, so linear.app, and once you log in, you&#39;ll see a list of issues that are in to-do.

We check for the data integrity and make sure that all of your coordinators are provided with real-time feedback if something needs to be corrected to make sure that the data is accurate.
For example, we test for things like making sure the EC-FMG certification date is correct. We make sure that all of the graduates at foreign medical schools have an EC-FMG certification date entered.
If there are errors within the data, we notify the coordinators so that they can correct it. And then the finance department can also review the errors and make sure that it is corrected before the data is exported from Metrix and sent to CMS.
We check for bugs. Uh, data problems and we also make sure that we automatically slice the data for, uh, compliance, meaning if you have residents that are going to different sponsoring institutions for part of the day, we&#39;re able to capture up to an, uh, down to the hour.

And I&#39;m assuming we can, we&#39;ll be able to edit this in the CRM later. For this video here, I sent you the, um, the Vimeo embed code.
What we&#39;re mainly trying to do is make it look clean so that it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s a YouTube video that&#39;s embedded there.
So I think Vimeo will allow us to do that. So we can put that there. And then underneath it, we want to- show, um, the name, the role, um, and the institution that Mitch works that.
So it&#39;s going to be the quote, a testimony like this. And then underneath it, we want to make sure that it- we have his name and- and, um, uhm the name title and, uh, uh, institution name.
And ideally, uh, can also show the institution logo. So it&#39;s a small thing that shows up at the bottom, similar to how we have it for other testimonials.
Uh, let&#39;s see, where do we have that? Like this here. But it would also be nice if we can show the, the logo.
Next. Next, umm, by the way, the logo can be optional if this school doesn&#39;t want us to use the logo.
Umm. Then we can also remove the request a consultation button. And then for this timeline, we want to add a final one.
That is, today. So this way, we have the pass, and then it&#39;s also a final one. That&#39;s for, umm, the present.
Because otherwise, a couple years from down the road, this will look very outdated. If we have a today one, it looks like we&#39;re always up to date.
And, for the scoreable pets here. Oh, by the way, when we put the titles up here.
For. The people. We can do it similar to the way that we have it down here.
Where it&#39;s. Umm, all capital and. Cleaner. Well, actually, you can decide. It&#39;s either one of these works works well.
Anyway, for the advisors, uh, section, um, pet advisors section, we like to have the six here, but also have a arrow, uh, to scroll.
So if we add more, it doesn&#39;t look overwhelming with a whole bunch of animals on the website, but we can still scroll to the right and see them.
So those are all the final tweaks for that we need to make for the website, and then we should be able to close this out.
And then the, uh, the, uh, the next project that we want to work with the, you want is you can see, like, how the header and everything, um, is slightly different than the other pages.
We want to update the branding to align with this new about us page. Uh, so the look and feel overall to align with, uh, what we have here.
We&#39;re not gonna have time to re-write me a copy, but it&#39;s more of general, general design.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e0c67006b7b14542a9b1d585cc1a31d2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Using GPT Tool for Google Sheets 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>So here is the GPT tool that I used.

So you&#39;ll see extensions here and then GPT for Sheets. Open that up. And then. What I did was I added our API key into it.
So set API key. I added it for us so that we can use our API key. There&#39;s also you gotta pay for it.
So you can. I just been buying. Credits as we need it. And once this is enabled. I can go in and paste equals GPT.
And write that prompt that I sent you. So this is all. Functional as soon as long as this panel is open on the right side.
Couple of problems that I sometimes happen is if it&#39;s not working. If you&#39;re getting some errors. You can try refreshing the page.
And see if it works. There&#39;s a couple of times where it still didn&#39;t work and I. I had to basically create a new.

I want to go through these issues that were reported and, and, uhm, summarize what may have caused the problems and what are some of the things that we&#39;re doing to address them.
So, this first one here, where we are having an issue with some of these rotations being scheduled from blocks 9 through 10.
to 12, we went in and reviewed the source data, uh, that was submitted, uhm, for the site availability. And the reason is it is getting scheduled for these blocks is because the spread, uh, the spreadsheet had availability listed for these blocks.
So, for example, I just filtered for a couple of these, uh, courses, 770, 771, if we look at, you know, these, uh, sites, there are, uhm, Availability is listed as available to schedule, available to schedule.
If we cannot have, these rotations take place in these, uh, blocks 6 through 12, you want to make sure that these are marked as, uh, blank.
Uhm, let us know if we simply can clear out all of the, uhm, Availability. For blocks 5 through 12 for these courses, uhm, and we can just do a mass change.
The only thing to keep in mind is, if there was already pre-fills or requests that were made for these availability, then those will be ignored by the optimizer.
Uhm, second item here is, there were, when, ah, there were some blocks, sorry, some sites, uhm, that did not have hubs defined when we ran the optimization, and there was actually quite a few of those.
And then, what we did today was, went back into Metrix and pulled another export, and we realized that there were a lot more hubs, uhm, updated onto sites.
So, basically, we ran the optimization with an outdated export from Metrix. Before all of the hubs were categorized into the, eh, eh, eh, before all the sites were categorized into hubs.
So, pulling a, a new export today, we were able to get more of those hubs, uh, uh, filled out. And hopefully, that&#39;ll take care of some of the, the problems that you saw.
For example, I think there was one thing student that had a rotation in Indiana and another one in, in, uh, New York.
I think that was happening because not enough hubs were defined and that student was getting scheduled into, uhm, rotations that were outside of the hub.
Next item here is the hub capacity. We did not implement this into the rules, uh, when we ran that optimization because we had a note from one of the meetings, uh, one, or an email that said this was no longer needed.
This may have been a misinterpretation on our end. Um, please let us know if this is still needed. We can go ahead and, uh, implement it.
Uh, right now it&#39;s only checking the site capacity. Uh, if we need, if we need to implement it, what we will do is use the hub capacity that was provided and then implement it so that each- hub has a maximum number of students, um, per block, um, and ignore the site capacity.
This last one here, um, where they were- um, students that are assigned to the same hub, um, sorry, uh, to the same site, duplicate sites for the same courses.
Uh, this is also a rule that was not implemented for- I think there were three of the courses that we cannot have, um, the same site for, um, for the same So, we&#39;re, we&#39;re essentially going to, uhm, apply this rule so that the same site is not used for the courses that shouldn&#39;t have the same site.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/27ab287572b041dab403b1356e0a72d3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metric&#39;s Gradebook: Revolutionizing Medical School Education 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Metric&#39;s Gradebook offers a centralized solution for medical schools, and Metric&#39;s, Metric&#39;s Gradebook offers a centralized solution that allows the students to see their preclinical and clinical grades in one location.

Even more powerful is when Metric&#39;s is utilized for the MSPE letter creation. This allows schools to take those grades from the Gradebook and dynamically generate various charts and histograms for the MSPE letter.
Metric&#39;s rotation grades in the Gradebook also allows the schools to capture preceptor comments and then also have revised versions of it if something needs to be modified, such as fixing typos or gradients.

So what we want to do with this particular task is let&#39;s, there&#39;s two components to it. One, I think we can make this easier to work with, with use, in your BSN one, I think you&#39;re expanding and collapsing it.
So we don&#39;t need to do all of the ones, things that you had there, summarizing a bunch of them and stuff like that.
Just give them a way to expand. Expand and collapse, it&#39;s, they&#39;re just going to see the actual questions and answers, the form, the form.
Yeah, yeah. And then, um, we also want to show the, the actual form name right now. We don&#39;t show the form name.
Okay. Um, and then the other piece here is the more important thing for this particular one is, right now, we are doing this using those rotation administrator permissions.
So the rotation administrator permissions are set up using the rotation record, and you&#39;re saying you&#39;re the rotation administrator. What you need to do now is apply the same thing for the course director permissions.
So, in Metrix, under curriculum, we already have course permissions called course director permissions. We&#39;re going to add a checkbox that says allow course directors to view evaluations, uhm, that were submitted for their course.
And we&#39;re going to have rotations that are linked to graded course rotations, and curriculum courses that are also linked to the same graded course rotations.
This means that, So you have, you have, uh, rotations under, uh, that&#39;s, that&#39;s mapped to graded course rotations in the gradebook.
And then you also have curriculum, rotate, uh, courses slash rotations that are mapped to gradebook course, yeah. So that&#39;s how, that&#39;s how the curriculum has, so like they&#39;re two separate things that are yeah like these two are not No, they&#39;re not connected to each other.
They&#39;re not related, like you don&#39;t have to take one and take the other, like, No, no, so the rotation, let&#39;s say cardiology, under system setup rotations, you&#39;re, I mean, under schedules and rotations, those are rotations that are offered at different hospitals.
So they&#39;re site-specific rotations. In the curriculum, you&#39;re saying, what is, what are we going to teach in cardiology? You only have one version of that, but that, in order to connect everything together, we use the graded course rotation as the connector.
You&#39;re going to connect the, each of the cardiology rotations you have to graded course rotation, and you also have that course, uh, graded course rotation connected to the curriculum cardiology, uh, course record.
What we&#39;re doing here is, if I&#39;m designated as a director of the cardiology course in the curriculum, I will be able to see, uh, submissions.
For, um, students that were scheduled for a specific rotation, and that&#39;s mapped to the same cardiology, uh, uh, rotation in the graded course rotation.
So all we need is a check box here that says a lot course director. You can, we can just say, a lot course director- directors to view summative, uh, evaluations or something like that.
Um, or evaluation allows course directors to view prior performance on summative evaluations. So, cause when, when that happens, if If you have multiple, multiple rotations, let&#39;s say cardiology is offered at five different hospitals.
And it&#39;s mapped to the safe cardiology rotation in the curriculum. If I&#39;m the director of cardiology, I will be able to now see summative evaluation for, any student that is going to any one of those five different rotations.
You don&#39;t have to go through every single rotation and set that up. Okay. Yeah. The parent. Okay. So, so the, the design here is, Hello.
Yep. You asked me to join. Okay. Uh, give me, uh, it took too long, so I started working on it.
Let me just finish this balloon video. Okay. So, essentially, uh, we&#39;re gonna add that checkbox, but we&#39;re also going to just clean up this summative form, which I already set up on, uh, on a demo.metrixlab.com under Arnold.
and just to make it cleaner where you can expand and collapse. Okay. So when they hit new form, is that form going to be completed?
That&#39;s a completed form? If it is completed. Otherwise, it&#39;s just seeing as that. So it can, it can be something that they can look at.
It&#39;s not even. You can, you can, you can say, you can say, only show this if it is completed. Uh.
Otherwise, just show the status. Okay. To make it cleaner. And then, then they would go down to the bottom and, uh, throw that out.
Um, the other, the other thing that we can display here, obviously is a, is a form name, but we, if it&#39;s a graded form, you can also show the grade here.
Because. because That would also be helpful. Alright, I&#39;m gonna. Yeah. So.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0c98867d71ba440d8337fe299b989c0e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating and Managing Block Schedules for Student Rotations</pre></td><td><pre>First thing that they would do is create a block schedule and then the block schedule will have blocks. Then they go to the lottery page and create a lottery and they can select the block schedule that they created.
And this would allow them to see blocks for each, uhm, site or rotation, and site and rotation combination. And plug in values for how many students will be allowed.
In addition to that, we&#39;ll also give them a way to set capacity for the site as a whole. Uhm, actually Rio and I had an idea for, I forgot about this.
We can actually, we can actually give them a setting when they create the lottery that says you want to set capacity at the site level or block level.
It&#39;s never going to be both. Uhm, so you can say, or at least, I don&#39;t, so far it hasn&#39;t been for both.
So it&#39;s basically saying one or the other, and depending on which you select, it&#39;ll change what you display in that, in that ah, blocks page.
Because it can, if they only need to set it by site, we don&#39;t need to display all the blocks. You can just basically say, here&#39;s the site.
And I think we should, we should still have the drop down, so they can open the Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, it&#39;s just right out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that&#39;s perfect, yeah. You know, inevitably, you&#39;re going to have some site coordinator be like, I want to double check that these are all right.
Yeah, you could, yeah, exactly. Uhm, so that covers this fun, uh, the setup of this page. That will be essentially one task.
We&#39;re going to be cleaning up the, uhm, the lottery creation page. And then we also, I didn&#39;t mention this earlier, we don&#39;t need to, we can get rid of the whole advanced phase, advanced phase.
There&#39;s no need to do that. As soon as you create it, we can show the blocks button, and then we, there&#39;s also a pre-fill blocks.
This way, it&#39;s not, like, if they make a mistake or something, they can always go back and fix it. Uhm, just, the phasing thing just goes away, and it just basically shows you, uhm, block, blocks, pre-fill blocks, and then, If they go back and fix it though, and they have pre-filled, does it need to
tell them that you, You need to re-check your pre-fill? So, exactly, so that&#39;s something to factor in there, so if you go back and change the block, try to change the blocks, it should be locked, and say, you cannot remove this because you have pre-fills.
So, yeah, that&#39;s one way to approach it, or you can say, There&#39;s a that says, uhm, if you remove this block, uhm, it&#39;s going to remove the pre-fills for these two students, uhm, or if you say, if you change, just change the capacity, you can say, if you change it from five to two, now you have, uh, this
is going to be over-capacity because you have x, y, pre-fills. So, yeah. You&#39;re going to have people that do pre-fills and they change something and then, Yeah.
So, then, when you get to the pre-fill stage, this is a function, a page that Rio designed last year and it&#39;s very, very nice.
It&#39;s scalable, uhm, so that I can go in there and pre-fill people to it. So, there&#39;s not really much to change here.
The, except for, uhm, connecting this to the capacities. So, right now, it shows you, it says two MS3s are allowed here.
I just, yeah, you can get rid of that. so it&#39;ll just say two students are here, or five, or whatever.
Uhm, and then, what, uhm, we want to do is make it obvious that some, a block is at capacity, capacity.
Because, what, we, right now if I look at it, if I had three people, it&#39;s, umm, this is fine, but if I ask, like, ten people here.
It doesn&#39;t change color or anything like that to indicate. Yeah. Some should not read. Yeah. Which ones are good? Which ones are very, which ones are over?
Doesn&#39;t let you put it over? Yeah. We allowed. Yeah. It doesn&#39;t know where you think you are. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
I should say. Do need to be letting it over? Um, yeah, you can have, yeah, you should have an alert.
You can have an alert, but here&#39;s, here&#39;s, I think what we can do is, uh, um, make it a setting when you create the lottery, whether you want to allow for over-filling or not, so that if it&#39;s a hard lock, they can just lock it down, and then the otherwise, um.
When you say I&#39;ve said yes to all of those, it should be. I&#39;ll let you overfill it, but it should just alert you that that&#39;s overfall for the color or something.
Or if they have said no, we don&#39;t want to overfill it, then the system shouldn&#39;t let you add more than whatever the number is in there, right?
Yep. Yep. Exactly. I think there should be an indicator of how much you&#39;re over.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2c1307fb3be0474b883eed7de9a7250e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Enhancing Client Relationships 🤝</pre></td><td><pre>I would like to write an email with this, uh, new statement of work that we have with our client. And, as part of our initial negotiations, we had emphasized to this institution that we would like to have quarterly check-ins with each of the schools.
Uhm, and their leadership. And that, the reason that we wanted to have this is to make it, uhm, this is standardized like we do all of our other clients.
Where we meet with them every quarter to review their high-level goals. And, uhm, understand, uhm, their, their needs, where they stand on their, uhm, usage of the platform. And set goals for the next quarter.
Uhm, and also to identify any uncertainties. Any, uh, uhm, challenges or dissatisfaction early. And this is, uh, important because, uhm, when it comes to the students and the faculty members using the platform, if for some reason they are, uhm, unhappy and we don&#39;t hear about it due to multiple layers
of communication, it&#39;s possible that they may, they may have a negative perspective of the platform. And in the future, when they graduate and go to another institution, they, uhm, the reputation of our product, can be, uhm, jeopardized.
That is why we like to have direct relationships, uhm, with these, each of the schools.

contract, uhm, and, and, and, uhm, that may not be due to the problem with the platform, but due to miscommunication.
An example of this is with the BSN program, where, uhm, the, the, uh, large, uh, contract was discontinued because, and without any, uh, clear communication and, and, uh, advanced, uh, warning.
Uhm, that is why we want to have this to be a requirement, and, uhm, without this, we are operating blind, and given that a TALIM is one of our, uhm, highest priority clients, uhm, that we&#39;ve been going, uh, above and beyond and doing a lot of custom development, uhm, it is a big risk factor that we

First thing I notice is that this email is coming from team at skimping.ai. I&#39;m not sure what that is. Uhm, but.
We got to make sure that&#39;s documented and something that it should be coming from a metrics email account. Another thing that when I click the reset password, I&#39;m taken to a page that looks like this, and it looks like, uhm, the formatting is all off, it&#39;s reset password, enter new password, formatting
is off, and then the top logo is not fully visible because of the background color there. Take care. Once I enter the password, I&#39;m taken to this page where I have this, uh, password changed.
It should be capitalized and I mean, we should have a better design for this. It shouldn&#39;t just look like this where it&#39;s, it looks like it&#39;s, uh, malpositioned.

Uhm, uhm, my recommendation is to create a Google document. under development, if you go into something, this folder here, specs and feedback.
So you can see here, this was the first round of feedback that I gave them.
So if you, I recommend starting a document like this where it&#39;s showing the problem as well as a description of what the fixes should be.

um ASCII and CPX colon Pediatric Patient Note Assessment. And then in the description of the form, so that&#39;s the first page of the form builder, we would put this.
And then as you go down, we only have one thing, one field that we can use for dividing up the sections.
So we have above the above each question, you can put like a section header, I mean a question title. But here, if we look at this, we actually have history taking and we have chief complaint.
Uhm, so we gotta kind of figure out how we&#39;re gonna make that work. So I would use history taking 20% as the header and then for the first question, I would put Chief Complaint as the question, then the description of the question will have this thing here, and then in parentheses in that description
you can put maximum two points. Forget this a simple, forget that part, and then you have this being a Likert scale with three options.
Each of those has a option that says zero. 0, 1, 2, and then the value of that is also going to be 0, 1, 2, and then the NA is going to be enabled if, if necessary.
Same thing here. This would be the question, question description, parentheses, maximum points, um actually no, I&#39;ll take that back.
So we, we can, what we want to do is something slightly different. History taking. Chief complaint. That can be the header.
Then question one is. Description for that is.
So that&#39;s the question. And then the options for that is going to be. Zero. One. Two. And then we have HPI.
Have a good night.
Yeah. So we got this thing here. This could be the question. And description.
We could try this. Try putting it here. It&#39;s a little long. Do it like this. In the section header. Maybe we can make it shorter.
Then we got that. We gotta get creative with it. description of um symptom attributes and we can put onset.
location. So each, each will be a separate multiple-choice question, and we will repeat that same thing down here.
Uh, when we get to something like this, we can put this as a question, and all of these items will go into the description.
We won&#39;t make separate questions at this because this is all one response. So, hopefully that helps. Essentially, what we&#39;re trying to do is take this form and use whatever tools that we have on the form builder to restructure the headers and the questions so that the person is getting the same context

It would be good for us to uhm get him to get him into this process too so that if we&#39;re going to have to approve Pooja we can also just have Ken do it here and avoid using the cash app.
Yeah, so I will. Check uh she won&#39;t want to rent I thought I had was uh so Ken does have shares so he&#39;s actually getting guaranteed payment.
Yeah, Ken Ken does have shares from the last time he was employed here At that time he was salaried and now he&#39;s hourly but I think since he Falls into that category I&#39;m not entirely sure if uh he&#39;s gonna withhold taxes Yeah, let&#39;s not change Ken&#39;s out.
We&#39;ll leave Ken the way that it is He&#39;s logging into Clockify anyway, but for Pooja. I don&#39;t want to I think for Pooja.
She&#39;s not used to doing $10.99 and probably Prefer to have us taking care of the taxes So we can go put her through the normal process</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9685b63c8958420e8f07e320300cf1d4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Requirements Portal Issue Resolution 🛠️</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m on the institutional portal, and I&#39;m not seeing any active requirements here, so nothing here even though I went in there, created a new template.
One thing to note is that I am logged in as Metric support user, I&#39;m not using the super admin. Uhm, so I went in there and created a new requirement called Tosh, test Tosh, and then assigned it to a whole bunch of people, but nothing shows up here.
I can clear these, and there&#39;s nothing. So I think there&#39;s something broken. Programs, School of Medicine, and Tosh, test.
So you can see that it is assigned, but it&#39;s not showing up on that page. It does work on the assignments page here.
On the, or maybe not, it&#39;s not showing up here either. Yeah, and I, uhm, think we had also said for this, uh, we can just call it.
Assignments, rename this to Assignments, there&#39;s a small tweak there, uhm, so that it matches the admin portal. So for some reason, uhm, this Assignments page or Active Requirements page is not showing on the issues.
Uh, the tasks that are assigned to the users. Let me see if I can try it on the admin portal, yeah, on the status board it is working.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b4be434b48214e55a7835092766768ea</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Reviewing Comments and Documents with Students</pre></td><td><pre>In this short video we&#39;re going to go over how to review these comments and documents with students. On the Metrics Gradebook generate MSPE page, we can see templates and then we can also have a select the MSPE group.
So when a student is coming to the meeting, what we can do is open up their document. You probably can do this before they get on the Zoom call.
So you have it up and have this window open and go through this together with them. And in here you can make any manual edits you want.
And when you get to the bottom, there is a save button. Clicking that save button will bring up a select new status option.
So if it was approved without making any edits, you can simply say approved. If it was approved with changes, you can put approved with changes.
And if something needs further attention, so let&#39;s say there are there&#39;s a section that requires a new import or something to be added that you don&#39;t have access to right now and needs to be handled after the meeting, use this needs remediation option.
And that will give you a certain status which will be shown on this page. And any time you are regenerating the uh The batch of letters, let&#39;s say come up here, regenerate for this group, you can select which statuses you want to regenerate.
So you can skip anything that&#39;s approved or approved with changes and then regenerate for draft or remediation. Under the view column, there is also a way to see history of any changes.
um have a way to change the status manually here, regenerate one letter instead of the whole batch. You can also download it to a PDF or download it to a document.
That&#39;s really all that is uh necessary on this page. And then if you want to also filter for ones that are draft or approved, you can do that at the top here.
Another tip here is when you are working with students and going from one meeting to the next, if you hold down the command button if you&#39;re on a Mac or a control button, before you click action and edit comment, it will open up in a new tab.
So that way you can keep this window open and don&#39;t have to keep selecting these drop-downs at the top. And it&#39;ll open up a new tab.
You can save it and then close that window. Come back here, search for the next student and continue that work.
Hopefully this is helpful and looking forward to getting any feedback that you have after you start your series of meetings.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ae85af65403a4d4cac202bbd7937e31e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front End Components and User Management Overview 👩‍💻</pre></td><td><pre>This task will be to create all of the front end components and, uhm, pages associated with creating and managing users.
So, uh, we gotta start with creating the three portals with links at the top, so it&#39;s gonna be the company portal, admin portal, personal portal, uh, and the company portal, uhm, on the left menu we will have roles and programs with the ability to, uhm, create a program on a, and it&#39;ll show a data table
. Uhm, on the roles page you&#39;ll be able to, we&#39;ll be able to create roles with the different criteria, uhm, on the, uhm, admin portal, we&#39;ll have the users page, the sites page, programs page, and then system settings.
And then up custom fields. So on the custom fields, you&#39;ll have the ability to create, uhm, different sections, and each section will have, uhm, custom fields getting added.
Uhm, on the users page, a page, it&#39;ll have a data table that shows basic information with the ability to, uhm, uhm, open a profile and see that person&#39;s, uh, detailed information.
Uhm, when they open up that profile, it&#39;ll be a user, uhm, portfolio page with all of the, uh, academic information they have collected.
The users page also have tabs at the top for What, by the way, actually, we&#39;re going to call it the peep, uh, the page is going to be called people, not users, and on this page we have a tab called people, groups, and, uhm, invite.
We won&#39;t be dealing with the groups tab in this, uh, functionality in this, uh, but on the users page, you&#39;ll be able to create a user, and which brings up a new page to create all the demographic information.
Uhm, the creation page is going to be the same as the portfolio page, except they would only have access to the about information.
Once they create the about information, they&#39;ll have the ability to, uhm, uhm, fill in additional information, such as documents.

There was a custom field that was created for hub and under case demographic, we have these hubs that are defined in addition to all these hubs, there was a dropdown that was created called nohub.
And there are 200 items or 200 sites that have the nohub option selected.
There are also many hubs that have no selection options. So it&#39;s just blank. If there is nohub, it should be blank.
When there is an option called nohub, it&#39;s, uh, it has a value. So the optimizer is treating it as if it&#39;s on hub, just like one of these other homes.
Other ones. Uhm, so. What we have here is basically there are a bunch of sites that are blank, which shows up as nohub assigned, and then we also have some that are, that are defined as, uh, hub, a nohub, which essentially, to the optimizer, which doesn&#39;t know anything other than values, is going to
be treating it as its own hub. So what we&#39;re planning on doing is turning all of these nohub values that were entered as options in the system, and just taking and putting those as nohub assigned, which is what we, which is the generic, uhm, uhm, value that we are setting that it&#39;s supposed to be blank
. And because there was this value, it&#39;s getting confused, essentially. I just want to confirm that there was no other reason why nohub was selected for 200 of them, uhm, and that it was simply to define that it was supposed to be blank.
And that, I believe, will take care of the, uh, the problems that we&#39;ve got. The interface with the hub. And it would be also great to, uh, get a list of other issues that you have, uh, sooner than later so that we can try to, uh, tackle them, uh, as soon as possible.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2f79279bfecf4802be7707629f624b8e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streamlining Evaluation Processes 💡</pre></td><td><pre>So, for second one, this is a more complex thing that requires, uhm, planning. So, this is the problem.
Essentially, when we have evaluations coming into the system, we&#39;re going to, we have, uh, a field on there. So, let&#39;s say this is, uhm, the MSPE demo server I&#39;m using, and if I, uhm, go into evaluations and templates, there&#39;s going to be one question usually at the bottom of a form that is they&#39;re using
to collect a comment from the preceptor and it says, it&#39;s the comment that goes into the MSPE letter. Yeah, it&#39;s like that they did a good job or they need to work on that Yeah, so what happens is, right now, if they want to send that comment into the gradebook, which is where we need it, uhm, for it
to no automatic way to do it. Either they have to open up each submitted evaluation and at the bottom of it, we have a section called add grade.
This allows them to select the course, select the grade, and then also set the and the comment into the, into the, uh, this is on the evaluations, uh, yeah, so what I&#39;m doing here is going to the, uh, assignments page.
Okay, so the email has already been assigned, it&#39;s already been done. They have to go back to the assignments page, re-open it.
And administrate it. So the preceptors, yeah, yeah. So the students even, like, started the email, they sent it to their preceptor, the preceptor opened it, they did it, put in their comment, they submitted it.
Now, as an admin, I have to go in from the assignments page, on the email, go down to the bottom, find the right course again, plug in the grade, even though that grade exists potentially elsewhere.
Yep. Well, they&#39;re not necessarily doing the grades and metrics, none of our clients are. Um, the idea was that if they want to grade this rotation, they can do this here, but they&#39;re mainly would be using it for comments, but it doesn&#39;t really work because they&#39;re getting hundreds of these forms.
I was about to say, I was like, so for every student, if they have 10 emails, they have to go into each individual email, select original comment.
Yeah. And then move that over to the thing. And if they were doing this, so if they, if they are moving this, um, so if they&#39;re doing a monthly review, this makes sense to do much.
Most of our clients are not doing it. So what&#39;s happening right now is Chris is doing it. So Chris is MSP season.
He&#39;s downloading it from the evaluation data and doing a bulk upload into the gradebook. So. Okay. But if they&#39;re doing it manually, we go back to the form we saw, I understand.
If they&#39;re doing it manually, we&#39;re down at the bottom. If they have multiple comment fields, they can pick one, whichever one it is.
It&#39;s going to It&#39;s going to be the It&#39;s going to be, uhm, So it saves the comment, and then you also have to save the grade.
So you have to choose, you don&#39;t have to enter any of this information in, you have to at least choose which graded core rotation Yeah, exactly.
So, so, this, this is useless in my opinion. Like, we did this, uh, Yeah, this is, uh, you know, we thought this was gonna solve it years ago, but no one&#39;s been really been using it.
So this, this concept here is to figure out a way to move all these grades into the gradebook. I mean, I mean, sorry, the comments as a grade record into the gradebook either automatically or doing it in a batch so that administrator can do it and Chris is not the one that does it.
Yeah Yeah So essentially what we need to so so Chris&#39;s solution for this Which I think like we have I had talked about it like a couple years ago and at that time what I was thinking about and and he like this is what the the leading idea right now is on the Manage questions page when you build a form
add a Setting on the question itself that says Yeah, and then and the basically anytime that is submitted it&#39;s automatically creating a grade record Yeah, yeah, so, so like, uhm, if you have, uhm, the evaluation is going to get assigned to a rotation.
Rotation records have a link to the grade book, graded course rotations. So you can use that relationship to find out.
Which course or rotation you, I mean, a rotation you&#39;re going to be adding the grade for, and then if you flag the question This is the MSBE comment question, then every time a submission happens school would have to go in to all of their forms and manually figure out which of the comment boxes is going
to be the MSBE comment if they have multiple comment boxes. There&#39;s usually only One form that they&#39;re using and they only have to do it once on the template.
But they only, they can only have one comment field that goes. There&#39;s no, they&#39;re not going to be able to, like, go through the day.
We have two comment fields like that form that we were looking at earlier. Yeah, yeah, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the, that&#39;s the, uh, something that needs to be, so from a, uh, uh, uh, that&#39;s the kind of things that Mike would need to put into the specs as, like, if you have, for example, the way that, .
. . I would, if we go with that idea, the way that I would need to do this is, and this is the type of things that I would tell Mike in a call or loom video that says, so if I&#39;m making this form, and that&#39;s, that, I mean, that&#39;s, that&#39;s a good example of .
. the type of things that need to be Mike needs. So for example, if I&#39;m building this form right now, and I&#39;m going to have, um, these objects here that are like a scale, that&#39;s the one question, the next question, I&#39;m going to create something that is for, uh, a text question.
And at the bottom, similar to the way that we have confidentiality we&#39;re going to have a setting that says, this is the MSBE.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e1ecb767d72844729f64cc9cb7743c47</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Version Profile Page Update</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, uhm, so for the, ah, new version, uhm, so you have the left, ah, menu, that&#39;s been updated, uhm, will have the expandable and colla- I mean, it can expandable and expandable and collapse, uhm, it&#39;s not perfect, probably will need some tweaks, uhm, we&#39;ll have, for this particular part of the
project, we&#39;ll be doing the people, and then under system setup, uhm, the, ah, custom fields, uhm, functionality, and at the top, instead of, ah, institution admin and personal, we&#39;ll have, uhm, metrics, I mean, or, uhm, I mean, we can call it company, or we can call it, ah, metrics.
Essentially, that&#39;s going to be for metrics employees. And then the admin portal and personal portal. In the, uhm, metrics or company portal, Well.
We&#39;ll have, uh, one menu item right now, which is for, actually, uh, two, two menu items. One is going to be for programs and just simply to create a program record.
And then another one for, uhm, roles, where you can create roles, uhm, in all the things associated with it. In the admin portal, we&#39;ll actually have people, uhm, programs, sites, and, uh, system services.
In the we&#39;ll have, uh, in the system setup, we&#39;ll have, uh, the custom fields. Uhm, and for, uh, how that, of, uhm, let me go back to the, uhm.
There we go.
So on the people page, uhm, for now we&#39;ll have a simple table view. That is modeled after the, uhm, the current, uhm, UI, uhm, with the new data table that is in the UI kit.
What&#39;s, uh, more important for this, uh, first version, I mean, the first task.
is for us to start building this profile page. And this profile page will have, um, basic information at the top, uh, the photo, which they&#39;ll be able to click and hover over and edit.
Upload a new photo, first name, last name, educators, the user type, then the role, and this person&#39;s, uh, primary program.
This resident is a mistake, we can ignore that. Uh, back to list to go back to the previous page. We have a breadcrumb at the top.
Uhm? The print profile essentially will.
We it&#39;ll generate a. A printable version. Then their home institution will be here and set up hospital.
We can just call it home institution class off. It&#39;ll show them the class of year. And current rotation will add later.
And we&#39;ll have a status that indicates whether the, the, this person has admin access or not. And then you can ignore this, uh, east wing.
And then there&#39;s going to be an alert section that appears if they&#39;re missing or any of their documents are expiring or expired.
And then we have these tabs for this particular task. We&#39;ll only be working on the about tab, but we can add these other ones except for messages.
And then we have the about section, which you can click to edit. You can ignore the heart. We can, we don&#39;t need to show that.
Then you have the home button. Institution. You can edit their contact information. There&#39;s little tools to copy different pieces of information.
The about account information, um, documents and certification. So when I&#39;m showing you these, uh, mock-ups, this is a concept.
What we want to do is keep the same fields we have in the existing system, and then it&#39;ll be shown under account for information, uh, documents and certification, and then under the demographics, you have a bunch of other fields that show up.
So if we go back to the current version of Metrix, and open up one of these profiles, this is the information that shows up here.
Account info, documents, certifications, citizenship status, emergency contact, additional info. So those are all the, all the information that we&#39;re going to be showing in the new version.
And the other thing that we want to do is inline editing. So if I click edit, all these fields become editable.
I can change it and then click save. We want to store who saved it. And when they did it in our, uh, the last person that saved it in our database.
Yeah, so this, uhm, is the, uhm, the new page.
And, essentially, it&#39;s all about building this profile in a way that it&#39;s scalable because, over time, this, these tabs will get filled with information.
And one of the limitations that we have right now is it&#39;s, it&#39;s somewhat clunky and slow, uhm, when you have a lot of data.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bf78084d28d34907b4598851edd55817</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Feedback Review and Manual Edits</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Lisa Here&#39;s a video going over what we&#39;ve worked on. I want to summarize this for you When we initially did the first run of the AI We used this sheet to collect feedback from the LMU team And the reason that we collected that feedback is so that we can help do any manual edits and also see what are
the issues the AI was having For the second batch, the LMU team made the changes directly to the comment But for this first one, we were applying those changes after looking at the feedback So when we did this, we missed a few of these feedback comments and the final import that was made didn&#39;t have
some of these manual edits So we went through this and identified a few of these that are shown in green here and we corrected it and we&#39;re in the process of importing those But while I was going through this, I noticed a couple of things that I wanted to bring to your attention So when you have something
like a one-word comment like committed and committed and patriotic You know, do we want to turn this into a segment?
A sentence like the student doctor is committed and demonstrates a strong sense of patriotism Um, flagged it in purple so that you can look at it But a more important item here was It&#39;s going take me a little bit to find it Search for negative here There are a few of these that are flagged as negative
comment And uh, I don&#39;t think those um Were all uh corrected Well They may the first one looks like it may have been corrected.
I would like you to take a look at this and see if any manual changes are needed and if so You can make changes that here and then we&#39;ll update those.
There was one that was flagged by the LMU team as HIPAA. So it said HIPAA violation mentioned students illness. I was wondering if you want to do something different about this comment and if you want to make manual edits, you can and then we&#39;ll get that sorted out.
So currently what we&#39;re doing is importing anything that is in green. Those are the ones that we made some manual tweaks to based on the feedback that was given by LMU and the purple one we&#39;ll do it separately after we get your feedback.

I&#39;ve been, ah, doing a little bit of work during this trip because we have a large opportunity with the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges and, uhm, we had a RFP that we were a part of and, uhm, we were selected as one of the finalists and on Friday I gave a demo
, a second demo, to the leadership team and it seems like we are, uhm, either at the top of the list or the second from the top of the list and American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges is an organization that oversees all of the veterinary medical colleges in the United States and they have
developed a set of competencies that they want to implement across all schools so that veterinarians in the United States are trained according to this set of competencies.
And what they&#39;re looking at metrics for is to provide a centralized platform that can collect the competency data for every vet school in the United States.
We have not done something like this before, but our clients, We typically sell to the individual universities themselves to do all the veterinary education management.
This includes competency management, scheduling, and a ton of other stuff. Uhm, this is a, we can support this on the national level without much development.
Uhm, since they&#39;re simply looking to, it&#39;s actually less functionality with, than what the universities need. The difference here is going to be, since it is a national organization, they want to be able to provide this tool for each school&#39;s administrators to log in and set up.
Submit the competency data, but we still want to be able to sell metrics to each university separately because they&#39;re going to be paying a lot more money for the platform because they need a lot more functionality.
And these schools also don&#39;t want to be using something that is provided by a national organization. For all of their local operations, such as scheduling, because they want to keep their operations separate from what this national organization needs.
So, as part of our, uh, sales pitch to them, we recommended that they have an ins- you know, uh, let me show you, uh, my propo- my, uhm, presentation to them on Friday.
So what I proposed to them, I went over a bunch of stuff, but I&#39;m gonna go to the more important things, is that they purchase metrics as a national, uh, a large deployment that we do for them, and then each vet school will have a login, so they administrators can log in and submit student reports to
them. And then if a school is already using metrics, then we can use an integration to pull that data automatically so the vet school doesn&#39;t have to log into it and submit that information manually.
So there&#39;s an incentive for those schools to switch over to metrics. On the local level, and there is an incentive for AAVMC to push us as a platform for all of those vet schools in the country.
And the idea is that over time, as more schools switch over to metrics, AAVMC&#39;s costs will go down because I said we can offer a lower cost.
The price per year for these schools that are submitting data using the integration instead of logging into the platform, uhm, because we&#39;re essentially going to be getting a fee from the university for all the students anyway, and then the AAVMC cost goes down.
So this is a, a unique, uhm, uhm, pricing model, but it&#39;s also a huge opportunity for us as a company because once the AAMC started using this and they&#39;re going to be an official platform, the chances of all of these schools switching over to us where there is already a lot of unhappiness, uhm, with
the existing platforms out there is very high, and there&#39;s a chance for us to consolidate the entire market. Uhm, and, uh, AAVMC, I also proposed to them that in the future they can even have alumni access so veterinarians that are practicing out there can log into the AAVMC platform and they can use
that to keep all of their academic data in one place. Which potentially creates another source of revenue for us and for AAVMC.
Anyway, uhm, that&#39;s a, that&#39;s a big picture. But what I&#39;m putting together is a creative pricing model that allows us to maintain, make sure that we close this deal, but also allows us to create a pathway to close all of these vet schools in the United States.
So here&#39;s a, here&#39;s a, uhm, a tiered pricing model. That, that I came up with, with the help of AI and analyzing a bunch of data.
Uhm, so base platform, 100,000 per year, AAVMC, that&#39;s going to be the base cost. Onboarding fee, 50,000 broken up into the first two years.
And then one of the things that they ask is, during the call, is like, what kind of support do we need And I said they need to have at least one full-time person that is working on metrics.
And in this email to the director, what I was going to propose was, instead of hiring someone immediately, let us handle that work, and we will assign a dedicated account manager.
That is going to be essentially half of their full-time work is going to be dedicated to you. And what I see for metrics is that, if we can get this agreement, we&#39;re able to hire a new support person, and then that person can learn by working with the AAVMC over the first two years.
They get a lot of support, and then over the next first two years, they can hire an in-house person, and we can go to a standard support model.
So it&#39;s a win-win for them and for us, so that they don&#39;t have to hire someone immediately. So this comes out, this is the standard pricing, and then there&#39;s a tiered 1, 2, 3, 4, where there&#39;s an annual fee that is AABMC pays for each school that will be submitting data for their students into metrics
as part of the reporting. So this is a scaled pricing based on the number of students per, per, uhm, school, and each will have an account in the system, but they&#39;re not going to be logging in.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ac6a84c9ab344f2c8aaf10ed4539d38a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Communication and Data Management Strategies 👥</pre></td><td><pre>Yeah.

Uh, I think what happened here is, uhm, Chris took this time off and then Maria was picking up what, uh, Chris went, uh, left off and then Chris came back and then she had already made a bunch
of progress and they&#39;re trying to get things sorted out. And the, and the other big challenge is the emails that we&#39;ve been exchanged with files.
Uhm, there&#39;s a whole bunch of Excel files we&#39;ve exchanged with, uhm, so the other thing that we&#39;re going to do next round is put everything into a Google Drive or folder and, and saying we&#39;re only going to exchange files through this central means so that we don&#39;t end up with a whole bunch of attachments
on either side. Uhm, and then, uhm, And... But I, but I agree with the challenges. Maria is not typically the person that is doing this kind of communication back and forth.
Uhm, and next round, most likely, either Chris or I will be the point of contact until we get that project manager hired when we&#39;re going to, we&#39;re doing multiple optimizations now.
So essentially, we&#39;re just gonna recruit for someone that is responsible for managing all the tasks and the emails back and forth, and then the, and the tasks are getting assigned to the data people to do the optimization.
Okay. Well, I think that will, will certainly work a lot better and I think. Thank you. It appears that one of the things that is a byproduct of Maria&#39;s work, yeah, she has templatized a lot of the stuff in this massive, complicated, yeah, Excel spreadsheet.
The none of us here know what half those things mean. Yeah, but I&#39;m sure they have a meaning to her.
It&#39;s hopefully it&#39;s in a, in a format where it will be making. Thank you. Yeah, and to be candid, they both have different set of skills.
Chris is very good at getting those things solved, and Maria is better at, so all of those different views that we usually share is usually.
Maria that creates it, because she can do a lot of things with Excel that none of us can. Uh, but I think what she needed, uh, with that, with, with Chris out of the picture, she&#39;s not someone that is used to relaying information back and forth, and she&#39;s usually, we just say, hey, can you put this together
, and she is, she needs to need a little bit more, uh, guidance on that. Where to stop, like, and not to go too far into the data and build something that is over-engineered.
Um, but I think everything that is, like for example, like you wanted, uh, I think you or Christy had asked for what are the outstanding gaps, outstanding slots.
That is available that, uh, so she actually, in that sheet that she shared, there is a tab that she built out a hole, uh, with the Power BI, uh, an interface that will now display what are the outstanding slots.
But just like most of our software developers, they need an interface to communicate with the customers and not just- say, here&#39;s what we put together.
If only we knew how to use it. It was awesome. Yeah. So I think, uh, Chris Sorei being that point of contact until we have that, um, uh, customer facing project manager is going to be the- it&#39;s going to be the 20-25 goal that way there- is a person that is kicking off the, um, the project and then also
doing check-ins to make sure that we&#39;re collecting the information and organizing it. And then it also makes it easier for, uh, uh, the other team members that aren&#39;t data oriented to just say, I just need to live in the data.
This is what I need to deliver to the project manager to get this over to the client. But I will say what we have been able to see, because, you know, each time we get something back from Rhea, then it has to go to our team to pick through and make sure that everything is correct and all the students
schedule the rise up. The ones that I&#39;ve looked at have been very good. Yeah, very few, um, weird f- Florida to anchorage back to Florida, sort of things for students to deal with.
So it&#39;s been high quality optimization, except for the missing stuff. And then it kind of seemed like we would send it back and that would get fixed and there&#39;s something else that&#39;s missing.
So anyway, thank you. So there&#39;s actually another component of this that we need to address is. we need to start where we need to prioritize collecting all this information in metrics because that&#39;s the other big, uh, cleanup that she was doing where if it doesn&#39;t match perfectly with the availability</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/90df3175c98548f98636af638269b086</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Engaging Graphics for LinkedIn 👩‍💻</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, I wanted to create this short video to explain how to create those graphics with help of AI for my LinkedIn account.
One of the first things that we want to think about is having a unique style since I haven&#39;t really been posting that much.
And most of my images are all over the place, and I wanted to share a couple of examples. So, for the first thing, is, uhm, simple infographics.
This guy here, he sort of mastered this by taking pictures. He taking little images, and that communicates an important point.
It, it&#39;s a little, uhm, I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not necessarily a fan of the, the way his design style, because it doesn&#39;t really apply for, uh, the professional audience that we&#39;re going for.
Each of his posts, he has something that&#39;s unique. He&#39;s communicating and then a, a simple visual to go with it.
It will be good for, for, um, us to come up with a, a style that uses, uh, a lot of white space and simple graphics, uh, to communicate with an important point, um, so that it becomes a pattern.
If I have a post that has a graphic, someone looks at it and they can see instantly that it was made, uh, by me.
The second, uh, Here is, uhm, I really like, uh, this guy&#39;s profile and let me show, he also uses, uh, simple graphics.
And, actually, this one is a GIF that is communicating one key idea. So, here&#39;s a good example of that. Of, uhm, where it&#39;s an image, but there&#39;s one thing moving on the, on it, so that it, it stands out.
And, for his post, he&#39;s also big on, uhm, carousels that are very clean and simple, and all of his styles.
You can look at his doc, one of his, uhm, one of his carousels and always know that it&#39;s coming from, uhm, him.
My internet is not great here. And the third example is, uh, Da-Shin-Chi, also uses a, uh, a lot of infographics.
So, her infographics are typically a one-pager that communicates a lot of value, so someone can see it. and reference it later.
But, the, the key thing to note here is she has a style. If I look at all of her posts, it&#39;s very clear that it&#39;s coming from her.
keeping that in mind, if we look at, uhm, how we can leverage AI, what I did was I copied, I mean, this, uhm, O1 preview is usually what I use for ideas, but it doesn&#39;t work with images.
I this yet, so we can go here and say, this is LinkedIn post draft. Matrix. So I&#39;m going to say, target audience is this, come up with ideas, and, uh, let me, Stop that actually, I want to put the post with it.
So, it gives us some ideas, ah, to start with. Hey, guys. What I like here, uhm, a couple of these are good.
So here, for example, showing a circular diagram. I&#39;m not going to read through all of it. I&#39;m going to, mainly picking out this post as an example.
So let&#39;s say if I got something that I like, what I could do then is I can switch over to GPT-4 and then say, uhm, eh, if you want to generate some of the graphics, you can try it.
Here, uh, I recommend, uh, if you want to use some things from here and mixing it with, um, something that you create, is, is it going to get a better output if he&#39;s do everything through AI LinkedIn always, um, always, uh, decreases the engagement.
And no, no one really sees it because I&#39;ve tried that a few times. A couple of tips here is let&#39;s, let&#39;s just try what it comes back with.
And GPT-4 allows. generation of images. Yeah, doesn&#39;t look that, ah, great. So, but, what we can do is, let&#39;s see, create a simple vector icon representing competency management in, medical education, and then for, ground, the colors, let&#39;s see, if I can, I&#39;m being lazy here, but, it would, it would
be better if we give hex codes, I&#39;m just gonna, cheat, say, Read this book. It&#39;s called me! Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s hit or miss.
Let&#39;s see. Okay. I mean, I think, uh, looking at something like this and then laying it out on. on Canva with a circular diagram and then using AI to generate simple graphics like this that can be used on, on the image will be the way to go.
So, what I&#39;ve noticed is infographs are graphics that teach something usually will get high engagement. Faces or people&#39;s photos will get high engagement.
Uhm, unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any photos to go with this right now. If, uhm, uhm, you know, whenever, whenever possible, it&#39;s always best to use photos.
And if I have a photo to go with, with it, I will attach it with that, with the task. Uhm, one more thing I&#39;ll show you is, you know, for our MedEdge blog, uhm, this is the, uh, the style that we&#39;ve been using.
With this gradient and a clean, simple background. So, it&#39;s best to make, uh, our, my LinkedIn post align with this.
And you can see sometimes when, like, these graphics that are AI generated, if you were to use it on LinkedIn, it won&#39;t get much engagement.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d16a029572be48f0afa4f7eb0e494363</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>T-Shirt Design Ideas Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>Rickson, thanks for putting these together. Uhm, I think, uh, for, uh, the t-shirt itself, we can go, cough, cough, cough, with a, uh, black color, and then, um.
Yeah, black color with white text and orange for an accent. Um, so for, Let&#39;s see. You What if we do something and I also we don&#39;t need to do it on the front on the back because that&#39;s going to be more money so we just do everything on the uhm one side the front, uhm, if we do, uhm, I, uhm, uhm, black
shirt with i3 in the middle So, and then the, metrics, m, in the, uhm, underneath it, uhm, see how that looks Or we can do i and then integrity with, like, one big i Yeah, I think i3 with the M in the middle See how that looks This one I think is a little too Christmassy be.
. I like this one a lot out of all of them. I think this one is has enough winter theme and also has.
. The core values.
So if we make this into a white shirt for this one, would it, it might work since it a lot.
So we have it like this and then maybe putting the metrics logo underneath it. Or just the M that might even be enough.
Anyway, those are some of the thoughts that I had. I think I will, uh, before you work on it, we can ask other people to also share feedback and then do one more round.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4f86483746f047b9a5f88cf4564cb99b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Users - Current Version</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video, I&#39;m going to be going over the entire users module and different functionality that is associated with users.
So we&#39;ll start on the company portal. And in the company portal, we will have the ability to create different roles.
And, these roles are going to be, uhm, some of this will be pre-loaded into the system, and others will be added as part of the onboarding process.
Only Metrix employees can create the, uhm, the roles. And, this company portal is also only accessible by Metrix employees.
Uh, currently, it&#39;s only the super admins. They can access it. So, when I create a new role, I can define a few things.
I could specify, uhm, the role name. Whether it&#39;s an internal role, and this means a role will be for users who are employed or enrolled within this organization, or an external role, which is for people that are employed by or enrolled outside of the institution.
But we&#39;ll be visiting this institution. We can also say which personal portal this, uhm. Individual access which in the new version of metrics we are.
Not going to have this currently we have. Company portal, institutional portal, admin portal, personal portal, and then for personal portals we have four different types of users and each of them have their own unique personal portals.
In the new version we will have two, ah, three portals. There will be the company portal for Metrix employees, there will be the admin portal for people who have full admin access, and then the personal portal where just will be the same for everybody, but they will see different pages or tabs based
on their level of access, the permissions they have. Uhm, but continuing down this functionality, so we have, uh, which programs do they have access, have access to this role.
So this is an important thing for us to maintain. Umm, in metrics, we have training programs, and each of those training programs will have different roles that they have access to.
So for example, if it&#39;s a medical school, they may be using the MS-123 role. If it&#39;s a residency program, they may do PDY-1234. Umm, we don&#39;t want all the roles to be visible to all the pr- programs since they don&#39;t need all of them.
So then, So that&#39;s the creation of the rules, and I, as I mentioned, we&#39;ll have company portal, program, uh, admin portal, and personal portal, but are, that&#39;s in the new- version.
Under the current version, we have, uh, all of these, uh, uh, company, institutional, admin, and personal.
On the, uhm, users page is where we can create the users, and on the users page we have people group.
Really? Whoops, an invite. Umm. And, uhm, here we have the ability to create.
We&#39;ll see different types of users. Umm, in the current system, we have faculty, staff, resident, student, uh, four different user types.
In the new version of metrics, we will have. Have a good day. Umm, three user types. There&#39;s going to be educator, learner, educator, and staff.
Umm, and staff is going, so learners are going to be- Students and residents, uh, educators are going to be, umm, faculty members and so on, and staff is going to be IT and other supportive staff.
The key thing here is- these types are fixed and roles can be created and each role has to be linked to a site.
That&#39;s our to a user type. So, that is going to be the same data structure we maintain. Umm. User types, three of them, umm, and roles are created custom and can be linked to those user types.
And one, umm, user type, and one role can only be linked to one, user type. We do have, umm, roles that can be changed if you&#39;re a resident, finishes their first year of training, they can advance from PGY1 to PGY2. We do want to maintain that, uhh, role.
We a whole history, umm, in their profile so we can see when their role changed from a PGY1 to a PGY2. This is something that would automatically get created and tracked, umm, we can use, uhh, the g- jango history functionality to do that.
Uh, a- a history plugin to do that. But we also want to make it editable for our customers because if they, let&#39;s say the the student graduated on a certain day and they didn&#39;t get to update metrics until two days later.
They want to make sure that they want to be able to change that they can. So those, that was, um, some topics related to user type, user role, and, um.
And the, the role of history. Next, um, let&#39;s talk about, um, home institution, which are sites, and, um, programs.
So, in, uuuh, metrics, we have site records, and we&#39;ll be having a separate module that will, um, um, we&#39;ll, uh, it&#39;ll be a separate app in, uh, Jango.
for sites, um, and we&#39;ll deal that with that separately, but for the sake of the user&#39;s app, what we want to do is, uh, create the sites model, and then we&#39;re going to- to link, um, each user, when they&#39;re created, have a home institution field.
So this is the site that they are enrolled in, or, uh, for their specialty or program. So sites exist, and then every user is linked to one site at any given time.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c7edda8c0b0a4dfe94e21a04ceef6817</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Explanation of AI Feedback Process 🤖</pre></td><td><pre>Lisa wanted to send you this video to explain what we worked on. So this was the initial batch that was sent to us, well the initial batch that was sent to us that we ran the AI on.
And for this batch, I had asked the LMU team to put the comments or the feedback into these columns, and our team made the edits.
This was the first time we were running this AI and we wanted to see what type of feedback we&#39;re getting.
And for the second batch, the team at LMU made those edits directly on those revised comments. So this first batch is the only one that we double-checked, and there was some comments that were provided by the LMU team that did not make it to the final strengths.
So that&#39;s what we did and we went through this and flagged any that required manual edits, and we&#39;re going to be importing those into the system.
But while we were going through this, we noticed a couple of things here, and I wanted to get your input.
So for example, this one it said student strengths committed, MSPE comment committed and patriotic. The AI turned this into student doctor is committed and demonstrated strong sense of patricism.
Patriotism.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c890880f5fa9418a885fabd99a8c8a29</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Benefits Module Overview</pre></td><td><pre>In this first video, we&#39;ll take a look at benefits, or the time-off module within benefits that we currently have in the system and how it&#39;s organized.
So Metrix has multiple portals. The highest level is the institutional portal. This allows the organization to set config, ah, settings that apply to the entire organization.
Then there is a department-level access, which we call the admin portal. Each department within the organization has its own portal that you can switch into.
And then there is a personal portal. Personal portal is available to each of the end users, which is going to be the residents, the faculty, the staff, everyone by default has a personal portal.
If they&#39;re given administrative privileges, they can either get access to the admin portals, the institutional portal, or they may switch and be given access to do something in metrics for a specific module.
In that case, they don&#39;t get the admin portals, they just get the additional functionality directly within the personal portal. So when it comes to the time off module, which is under benefits, with this new change we&#39;re going to be doing, we&#39;re going to get rid of the benefits and just put the time
off directly on the left menu. So on the institutional level, they&#39;re able to create different categories, give it a name, and then also define which category they&#39;re going to include in And then some of the categories gets included in our IRIS module, which is for financial reporting, and this defines
whether it&#39;s included. So a category has a description and a name, and it can belong to one or more accounts, and it can be included in IRIS or not included.
Once we have that, we&#39;re ready to find in the administrative portal, we have the ability to review and approve requests from different individuals.
So we can say these are the accounts. I can open one up, and I can request, or I mean, I can, I can submit a request on behalf of this student and save that into the portal.
If someone made a request from their personal portal, I&#39;m able to approve it here. Let&#39;s log in as a student.
And as a student I can go in here and submit a request. Here I can say category, whether it&#39;s full day or partial day.
Then I can see the start time and end time. Submit this and it goes to the admin portal for approval.
And then once it&#39;s approved, it shows up as approved. And then also on the dashboard of some of the portals.
I also have a time off section where I can see, uhm, who&#39;s off today, if there&#39;s anything to show. And then, every time a time off is approved, the calendar and the schedules are also showing who&#39;s been approved.
Okay, so now, looking at this tool. So, this is meant to be the redesign of time off module.
We&#39;re using the ShadsCN, uhm, library for this. And when I made this, I put all of this on one thing with sheet, uh, separate tabs for each page.
So, for example, my request is actually for the personal portal where a user can go in there and request a time off.
So, ideally, we want to put this in there as a single page application and it will show up on each of the portals and depending on which user is accessing it, they may see different functionality.
So, for example, if I&#39;m a student, I can go in here, I can request time off, select a category, pick a date, end date, and then partial day.
Actually, it should be slightly different, where I want to pick, uhm, full day, then it shows me the dates, or if it&#39;s partial day, then it only lets me select one day.
And then I can go in there and select that. Set the start time and end time, submit the request. And then, I can search, and I can also view what I submitted.
Edit. And when I submit my, when I view it, it&#39;s also showing me. Uhm, what other shifts, uhm, what other rotations and shifts that happened on that date, so that I can see if I need to have coverage.
So this is showing me what other rotations are happening on those dates, who&#39;s, who else is scheduled. This is showing me what shifts are scheduled that day and who else I need to cover, and if anybody else had taken off that day.
So this is not current functionality. We&#39;re going to be shifting. It&#39;s showing this as part of the new, to new functionality.
I can also view history of what people added. I can delete it. The other thing that, uhm, we can do here is split the strip time off.
Model&#39;s actually not complete. Let me see if I can. This actually should be. Allowing me, uh, when I once I pick the date is supposed to click next and it&#39;s going to show me the same information as here and also, uhm, also allow me to attach files.
So. The existing functionality in metrics. Does not allow for files and it does not allow for viewing of. Viewing of the current rotations and shifts.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b4254762c91c4e519d20f9639e529dce</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Managing Standardized and Didactic Grades</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so for this one, we have didactic grades and standardized exam grades. So when we look at metrics, standardized exams are going to be stored in exams here on their profile and for each of our clients, we can add different types of exams they want to store in the system.
You do see that by going to Institutional Portal, System Setup, Customized, Exam Types, and we can add MBEO1, MBOE2, whatever, 123, similar to the way they have Comlex 123.
Once it&#39;s added, if we go to Performance, let&#39;s see, I think if you go to, yeah one, uhm, this Exams page only shows up if the program type is Residency, so I&#39;m going to show you how to, uh, uhm, make that work for them.
So you go to Company, go to Programs, and click Edit, change it to GME, right now it&#39;s probably on UME, you can change it to GME, go to the Performance page, which will allow you to, if you import, I mean MBEO grades for all the students, you can do 1, 2, 3, you don&#39;t need to do all of them, I think
she said in the meeting, like when they take these exams, if there&#39;s second year students, maybe they only have the first exam, but as long as we have some grades and you can do the import using the CSV, and once you&#39;re done with that, you can come back here and change it to UME.
That&#39;s the first standardized exams. For the other grades, which is the didactic grades, we want to put that in the grade book.
To do that, you go into the grade book, set up, and we would create score types for them, score types are created for courses that are added to the curriculum.
So if you, it&#39;s gonna, when you go in here and add new score category, it&#39;ll let you select courses from a particular academic period and define the grade.
So if we look at this, they want Thank you. grades for didactics and you can put it as up to up to a hundred.
So it would be add category, select a course, didactics. And out of a hundred published dates you can pick whatever you want.
And then we can also add score status. A, B, C. And that could be the primary status. That&#39;ll take care of this whole setup.
Um, and then it says to import the grades. We can also use our grades import to import grades for Didactic.
Didactic.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/79f18830311c42e59656edec57a2aacc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Document Comparison and Graphic Design 🎨</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Erickson, so I compared these two documents and, uhm, we lost a lot of, uh, important things, important points, uhm, when we went to cut it down, so I think, uh, it&#39;s going to be fine, uhm.
Well, let me go through this first, and then we can see if we want to cut anything down. So here, uh, right on the cover, I don&#39;t know which school&#39;s images that we&#39;re showing here, uhm, Like, we&#39;re covering three different schools, we&#39;re gonna have to have Ross&#39;s, uh, information, LMU, and Purdue at
the top, and then we don&#39;t want to pick one of the schools, I think it&#39;s better to use something generic about, uhm, like, create an image using the, similar to the blogs that we&#39;ve been doing, uhm, so that it&#39;s more of a product-focused screenshot than a specific client, since we&#39;re mixing three clients
. Then here, yeah, this is fine.
So this here, improved efficiency, satisfaction. This is good, but if we can make, so this paper explores, uh, how metrics clinical optimizer, and then maybe create a graphic that says, that shows, umm, we want to say that what it&#39;s helpful for, um, explores, umm, so for example, clinical rotations,
lab assignments, and then we can put those. Those two as, uhh, more prominent images, and then, Umm, we can put the three logos of the schools in the middle.
So, instead of having a paragraph here, essentially, we&#39;re gonna say that this paper explores, uh, as a graphics, um, sorry.
This paper explores how, Metrics, uh, clinical optimizations skip. Can&#39;t talk. Let me do something here. Here. Here. Oh, if we take.
Big. Then, umm, some sort of, graphic to, say, maybe like, a par, uh. To indicate that this, we&#39;re going to be helping these two, uh, type of clients.
And then, on the right side, it would be, with, automated creation of- actually, we can put it like this, and then here, if we say student preferences, um.
Adduation, requirements, and capacity. So, all of these things are used to create the automated schedules. So, some graphic that visually communicates this, uh, that can go in the middle, and we can get re- of this text, and then we can show the three schools icons.
And we can keep this paragraph. All right, graph. That is fine.
Let&#39;s see, a clinical.
So in between these two. We, if we can put together a graphic. Let me see if I can do something here.
Some, ah, is not great, but something where we can show a whole bunch of different sites, um, and what we want to do is represent, um, you know, if we just have a map of the U.S.
and the- and just put a little, um, icon, like a location icon in different states all over the map. We&#39;re basically saying these are all the different rotations they have.
And the school has to coordinate between them. Um. We&#39;ll see you So this also we can put into a table.
All right, so we&#39;re going of a Let&#39;s see.
so here. Yeah. Put this on the- Umm.
Okay. Yeah. Put this at the top.
Just gonna add this to the top. up. So we could go to this and kill this whole page, and then turn this into a, a, uhm, table.
Traditional solution is not a, And then, uh, for the first two, maybe we can have it, like, uh, one, like, uhm, slightly gray color.
And then the last one to emphasize how this is, uhm, the best solution, it would be more, uhm, maybe, like, an orange with the, the header, so that it&#39;s highlighting that one.
Alright, so then we get to this page. So, here, uhm, we can create a graphic of input, and now- our input would be ranked student preferences, uhm, degree requirements.
prerequisites. Total.

When, uhm, I looked at Quit, uh, JustWorks, your salary is actually 73,500.
Initially when we talked I had 74,000. I had on here. This is actually your current salary that you have in JustWorks.
When, before our meeting, I was trying to get your salary to apply the 10%, uhm, raise to it, and I should have gone into JustWorks to pull it, but I was trying to save time, and I looked at a spreadsheet that we have in Google Drive, and that showed me that your salary was $74,400.
And I think that spreadsheet, we had a higher number because we were estimating that at this time, we would be paying you that much, uhm, based on, you know, a, a, a growing expenses.
Some sort of projection that we did, uhm, but this is the actual number. And when I said it&#39;s higher than what we expected, that what I meant was $74,400 was at some point in the past, we had projected, that is what we will be paying you.
Uhm, but instead. October 1st, you&#39;re getting the raise to $80,850 and then to, in January 1st, to $85,000. That&#39;s what I meant by it being higher than what we had on there.
Uhm, but the, the, ah, essentially the main. Mistake was, I was not using your actual salary from JustWorks. It was, the number that I had showed you earlier was not your salary.
It&#39;s actually, it was actually, ah, a few hundred dollars, um, higher than that. So hopefully this clarifies it and everything that I said is, is still the same in terms of ten percent.
Raised is getting applied October 1st and then January 1st is gonna kick in at the 400 per month, um, once the insurance is cancelled.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/086f96e2349a4d618545bde8d99db548</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Enhancing Student Retention Strategies 🎓</pre></td><td><pre>Here are the answers to this. I forgot to write back to him. Silvana, you can take lead on this. About retention, we want to point out two types of retention.
One is student retention. So there are a few things that play into student retention and we can actually research this.
Yeah, so uhm when it comes to, we don&#39;t want to send anything wordy, we want to send bullet points. You know, when it comes to having a centralized platform, it allows the students to be more engaged with the organization and see their schedules and where, what their goals are, see the curriculum, which
chances are they&#39;re going to have a higher chance of success because of that visibility they have. For example, when they are going to a rotation, having goals and objectives delivered to them via email a few days before automatically means they&#39;re more aware of what their expectations are and are more
likely to be successful. When it comes to the advisory relationship, Metrics allows the school to collect data across their academic journey, which means advisors, faculty, and staff are able to intervene earlier.
However, if there is a problem, they can monitor for their their weaknesses and problems they have in education and come up with remediation plan early.
If they are collecting information on various systems, chances of something getting missed is higher. Also, currently they&#39;re collecting course evaluations on Qualtrics.
If if that is being done in metrics, the students are able to provide meaningful feedback on their experience, different courses and rotations, and the school can intervene if there is a problem with faculty or education.
Or, if they&#39;re being mistreated, um by having that in one place with automatic alerts, means less chances of those um student reported problems from getting missed.
And you know, using data to track warning signs, this is key, uh, to make sure of retention. So retention, we can, we want to point out, is not going to be entirely solved by software, but it&#39;s all about having a software that allows the humans to identify these problems early and address them.
And by centralizing their processes into one system, there&#39;s a higher chance of that happening. And if there is an intervention that is put in place, metrics can also use, be used to track that intervention and then follow up with surveys to make sure that it&#39;s successful.
And another piece of the retention formula is the sense of community and engagement. It&#39;s one of the reasons why metrics is a very engaged, visually engaging platform with photos of their students, faculty members, so that when they are using the system, they are feeling connected to that community.
The um, uh, the second piece of this is staff and retention, so we can have that as a separate section.
So metrics is a tool that is very easy to use, and because we&#39;re a very hands-on team, we are providing a lot of training and uh advice to these administrators, deans, other staff members, so that they&#39;re getting the most out of the platform.
When someone is struggling to use a software system or do not understand the processes of an organization, they&#39;re more likely to leave that job.
Uh with. With the metrics, with our support and our team, we can make sure that your staff members are productive, happy, and then also able to get up to speed faster if there is a new hire.
That&#39;s the second component that so this other question. This is how granular can get metrics, how granular does get metrics get with scheduling.
We get very granular. You can get down to specific lectures, labs. You can even You know, you can even have individual students getting scheduled to a specific lab and then all of those changes can be made down to the individual students or groups.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/aef987b6bccc4bd9a1784bc3b5d2a5e3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Salary Calculation Explanation</pre></td><td><pre>So, I wanted to explain, uh, what happened. When I was preparing this document before our meeting, I looked at the spreadsheet that was in Google Drive and it had, uh, your, your salary to be $6,200 and I multiplied that to get the $70,000.
$74,400 as your current salary. That&#39;s what I had on the document, uhm, but that is not, this is your actual salary.
The $74,400, I think, was on that spreadsheet because in the past we had, uhm, projected what future expenses would be, and we thought that&#39;s where you would be for, uhm, in the future, which we would be now.
So, we were expecting to pay you $74,400, and, uhm, that&#39;s what I pulled initially. And then when I looked in QuickBooks, I mean, uhm, it just works.
This is what you have as your current salary. So, initially, I was looking at the spreadsheet number, and I applied all the formula to it.
But, with the, uh, 7,300, uh, 73,500, 10%, these are the correct numbers. And what I meant by it being higher is that spreadsheet had, uhm, 74,400 as whatever the amount where we would be paying you at this time, uhm, but you&#39;re actually getting a raise to 80,850, uhm, Thank for your attention.
That&#39;s what I meant by it&#39;s higher than what we had on there. So hopefully that clarifies it, uhm, yeah, I, I should have pulled it from QuickBooks in the future.
I&#39;m gonna do that. I was trying to save some time, uhm, in between meetings because it takes me longer to log into JustWorks, uhm, but in the future, I&#39;m gonna always just rely on that when, when pulling this so there&#39;s no confusion.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7f6b794ef22c4c2eb3dffcb9cfbb4ce4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Feedback and Font Consistency Review</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to go over this briefly and share my feedback, uhm, overall it&#39;s looking great but we wanted to, uh, give some general feedback, uh, and then once we do another round of changes I think our team should be able to take care of any, uhm, tweaks that we need to make on our end.
Uhm, so, this would be the last round of feedback, uhm, and then, I think it should be the last round of feedback, I&#39;m hoping to, uhm, are we, our designers are able to work with Canva and they make it, make, they can make adjustments as needed.
it. Just going over the big picture items, one is, I want to make sure that we use a consistent font size hierarchy, uhm, across, across the, uh, product, I mean, across this, uh, document, because I feel like sometimes, uhm, see, so for example, this is 36, this is 30, 12, uhm, 11.5, so it&#39;s, I want
to make sure that, for example, if this is too much text for it to be 12, you can go ahead and, uhm, cut one of the sentences because we&#39;re going to be making some adjustments, uh, anyway.
So the, the most important thing is just to be visually appealing for some of these bullet points. Even if we need to cut back on it to make the font look nicer and cleaner, it&#39;s okay.
Because that knows, after I look through this, I know that we have too much text and I&#39;m going to be making some adjustments, but our team will take care of that.
But I do want to make sure that the font hierarchy is consistent across the, uhm, ehm, the document. And then the other thing here is, uhm, uhm, I think, uhm, it would be good if we can.
Make this, like, uh, kill this text here and, uhm, move this up to, there, the five areas that we see.
Who we and at the bottom, and then, uhm, we can also use this space, like, who we serve and then a bunch of client logos at the bottom.
Uhm, we can add the logos later if you can put some placeholders. So it&#39;ll be basically who we serve and some sample clients.

Excuse my nasally voice, still recovering from a cold.
But, each of these folders contain sample evaluations that we generated with the help of AI. And, if I open up Internal Medicine here, we have the new ACP.
And, they&#39;ve been broken up into three groups. Faculty Evaluation of Residents. We&#39;ll have multiple forms here, which are, for example, this first form, General Inpatient Evaluation form.
And, for each question, we&#39;ve also identified which ACGME sub-competency we want to map to. You can see there&#39;s different forms for different settings.
If I go to the 360 degree, this is going to be 360 Evaluation of Staff. And, that is meant for nursing or other staff.
That&#39;s going to be working with the residents to have them provide feedback. And, there&#39;s a Peer Evaluation form also. What we would like you to do is go through each of these forms and simply add comments of anything that you want to change or remove or add.
And, then this is something that we could review and, and, ah, show the team how to get this done. Just add it to the platform.
You can also recommend any changes to the mapping if you want to map it to a different sub-company. Same thing for every single specialty.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/644ecbb4ea7142b9a633de97d8d542cf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Overview 📊</pre></td><td><pre>So I&#39;m going over uses data for St. James School of Medicine and how they&#39;ve been using Metrix platform so in Metrix we have 878 users from the St. James Institution, actually 877 because one of them is our admin user, and then if we break that down by faculty and, and, uh, preceptors there are 446 users
using the system. there are 416 students in the system that have used the platform, and there are 16 staff members that have accounted metrics, uhm, in terms of, uhm, other type of information.
They are currently not using our time off module. They are not using our attendance module.
For case, ah, case logs, there are case, ah, seven case logs. that they are using. And then since the beginning of time they have created 57,933 case logs as other students have entered and, uhm, uhm, across various rotations.
So, if we look at the users that are in the platform, I mean all those users, those learners that are in the platform that have been logged in cases.
metrics has been used to, uh, track the case law compliance.
For all of the graduates and signing off that they have met all the graduation requirements.
for their, uh, curriculum module.
For the curriculum module, there are, are 91 institutional level objectives that have been added and 25 courses and rotations that are being, ah, managed.
in metrics with, ah, administrators set up for each of them. For each of the courses, there are objectives that have been added.
Search. All of the, uhm, the courses, I mean for, ah, for most of the courses that have been added, uhm, they&#39;re having, uhm, they&#39;re having objectives, and those objectives have also been mapped, at least to the course level, for multiple, for multiple courses, uhm, let&#39;s see how many, there are no
errors in our system. There are 13, uh, 1,341 unique keywords that have been added to the platform which are broken down into, uhm, categories.
Those, uhm, 1,341 keywords have been broken down into 109 different categories.
Great. Next, uhm, metric cell.
Now houses, uhm, the MSPE letter template, and this has been, uh, standardized to the school&#39;s requirements. There&#39;s, uh, multiple templates that have been configured, one for the MSPE letter transfers that are coming there, as well as MSPE for the students that have been there for the whole time.
And there are two charts that are automatically been, uh, that have been configured for MSPE letters. One for the core rotations and the other one for preclinical.
So, 3,000, 4 512 grade, uh, uh, grade entries have been added, uhm, for students for the pre-clinical courses.
Sorry, that&#39;s for the rotation courses. And this has been done for the, uh, MSPE letter. And these grades are also shared with the students, uh, on their portal.
And for, for, uhm, graduation. Uhm, Metrics Academic Progress Dashboard is tracking 341 students, uhm, and a list of alumni to ensure that all of their graduation requirements have been met, including the required number of rotations, required number of, uh, electives, and the advanced introduction to
clinical medicine, uh, uh, courses. When we get down to, uhm, evaluations, there are four evaluation forms being used in Metrix, including another four.
historical forms that have been, uhm, deactivated. These, uh, forms include, uh, MS, 2023, I mean, uh, MSPE review, end of rotation assessment, and, uh, student evaluation of faculty.
The current academic year, there have been 235 eval, eval assignments that have been assigned through the platform, and out of those, 169 were already completed.
58 that was overdue, and, uhm, 59 that&#39;s incomplete, and 3 that has been unable to assess.
Since the, the start of the contract, uhm, 2096 evaluations were sent out from the platform, uhm, with, ah, 1399 completed evaluations, 674 that hasn&#39;t been completed, 500, uhm, 87 that is incomplete, sorry, the 674 is overdue, 587 has been incomplete, and then we got a, ah, 13 that&#39;s unable to assess
and cancelled, that&#39;s been, that&#39;s 51. Alright. Resources, there are five different, uhm, resources folder that&#39;s been configured to share documentation with different users, including, uhm, rotation resources that have files for each of the rotations that the students are, uh, scheduled to go to, perspective
student assistance support, uh, folder resources, and, uh, course resource for, uhm, 501 documents.
Yeah, uhm, 501 documents have been stored in the resources, uhm, folder. There are 23 different, uhm, different clinical sites being tracked with all of their clinical details, I mean, all the addresses and contact information that&#39;s made available to the students.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, yeah. I thought I clicked it wrong. Yeah, okay. So there are, 3rd and 4th year students being scheduled, uhm, in metrics, uhm, in the 2021-2022 academic year, uhm, 941 schedules were assigned.
2022-2023, 898, uh, rotations were assigned in metrics.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eb4df40762954cf9a25948256491bf6f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Content Marketing Pipeline Process 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video, I&#39;m gonna go over the content marketing, uhm, I guess, pipeline process, and everything else I can think of related to content, so that we have it organized.
So, the first thing is, uhm, we have a weekly content meeting that happens every Wednesday, and this is where we discuss what are some of the active projects, and also, or new ideas, uhm, in addition to this, we have monthly, the webinar meetings, and, uhm, stand-ups that happen three days a week.
So, to review all of the, uhm, content that we put out there, let me open up a new Google doc.
So, we have social, we have have a a webinar, email, and intercom.
So, for social, we have, uhm, a few items.
It&#39;s going to be Company LinkedIn and then LinkedIn and mainly there&#39;s my account, Katie&#39;s account and, uh, Silvana, who are actively posting, uhm, in addition to these there are others that have expressed interest in it, but haven&#39;t really done much with it.
When I go to the website, we have, our blog post, and if you go to the blog post, I&#39;m going to call this MedEdge, we call it the brand, the, the content brand.
That is MedEdge, and the categories that we have here are, let&#39;s go announcements, case studies, events, features, MedEdge, team stories.
And I think these nursing and veterinary is not really categories. I&#39;m going to delete those. So announcements will be something like, uh, new clients.
Case studies. Let&#39;s see, uh, use case. We would publish a case study on the case studies section on the website.
We would also post a blog article. This is conferences, features, highlight of features. So, announcements, which is for new client announcements and such.
Case studies, which is for just, uh, having a case study on specific use cases. Events, uhm, event category, blog type is for conferences, retreats, etc.
Features, highlights new features that were released or things that we want to highlight of high value items. MedEdge, category shows podcast articles.
So after we publish a podcast on the, uhm, Apple and Spotify, we also create an article from that content. Team stories, stories about the team, new hires, milestones, details.
And then on the website, we also have a resources section, and this includes all of these items. So resources, case study, webinars.
Documents, so this is, ah, Lead Magnet, webinars, ah, so we got, documents, webinars, case study, that&#39;s it.
Then we got, our actual webinars that we give, there are two types, there are Metrics, ah, sorry, MedEdge, Academic Leadership Series, so this is what we call our Ex, External Marketing Webinar.
We call it external because it is, ah, promoted to, uhm, the public. So that includes Newsletter, LinkedIn, Website, EGC, then we got MedEdge, uhm, sorry, Metrics, Client, Webinars, this is what we call our Internal Webinars, it&#39;s only for Metrics, client usually Administrators, and these Webinars cover
, uh, includes monthly product updates and a topic discussion, so we pick out a topic that&#39;s relevant to them and cover it in that Webinar.
And these, we have guest speakers. OK, and then. What do we got so? For both of these we want to templatize.
The, uhm? Webinar templates in beautiful.ai. The only challenge, so we want to templatize it there. The, uh, only challenge is when we have guests present.
Speakers, they&#39;re not always going to have access to beautiful.ai and may not have familiarity with it. So they may send us the slides in PowerPoint or Google doc and we will need to help them convert it into beautiful.ai.
Or for those guest speakers. We can just let them use their own slides. Uhm, the benefit of putting everything into beautiful.ai is that we have our own branded look.
For this same thing, uhm.
Alright, so then, if we, uh, while I remember this, I want to put it at the bottom, non-marketing assets. So So the first category at the top is Content Marketing, Channels and Assets, and the bottom I&#39;m putting Other Assets, uhm, so that I have it here.
Uhm, we have Onboarding Meetings. These are client onboarding meetings. We typically create, standardize, and Google.AI, and we also have Sales Presentations.
Right now we&#39;re doing that in, uh, Google Drive, but if we&#39;re going to be using Beautiful.AI for other things. We should move this over there too.
Let&#39;s keep that at the bottom. So, so far we have talked about, um, all these next we have email.
So for email, we are using MailChimp. Let&#39;s see. Quarterly newsletter. Adding all of a webinar, I guess.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eed3591538444d968c74609f2057b918</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Student and Employee Engagement through Data Analysis</pre></td><td><pre>So thanks for bringing this up. I was going to follow up, but I got lost in other work and haven&#39;t wrote back to him yet.
So you can take lead on this and write back. So thank you for meeting with us yesterday. It was helpful.
We touched on one of the points, getting clinical faculty. It sounds easier. Blah blah blah. Question is about retention. We didn&#39;t have time to get.
So for retention, what we can emphasize here is one of the key things for student retention is having meaningful data over time so that they can see how the trainee is progressing and support their ah support them in areas of weakness.
So when it comes to metrics, the fact that we can collect these evaluations in different settings from different individuals and have that real time visibility means that I do.
advisors can look at this information, see where there&#39;s weaknesses in their uhm uhm in their performance, and talk to them in their advisory meetings.
The second thing is, uh when it comes to student happiness and engagement, being able to collect feedback from them. About their experience with their courses, rotations, and address any uhm uhm mistreatment or problems early means there&#39;s an increased chance of uhm uh a problem being corrected, so they
they are not dropping out or or leaving. And the simple fact of having a centralized platform so that they are more engaged with the university and their colleagues uhm also plays a role into into engagement.
As for, that&#39;s the first part. The second part is for employee engagement, and other staff. Um and f and have less learning cu to get things up and runn</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ad915494afa24fa984f6ce72d6f4f54d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Development Task Testing Process</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we will go over how to test different development tasks. So, under the QA board in, uh, Jira, we have these columns, and anything that is in QA dev or QA product can be tested.
So, to test it, we would click on it, and on the right side, we have pull requests. So, pull requests are records in Jira, where where developers will be pushing code.
But, since we don&#39;t use Jira for our code management, we actually link this through an integration to GitLab. In GitLab, they have something called merge requests.
It&#39;s just essentially the same as pull requests, uh, their lingo. And on here, we have code deployed. And when I click directly into that issue, I get to this page.
And if it&#39;s, if it&#39;s already been deployed to a development instance, you&#39;ll see this view app. And you can actually see the server name here.
Every time we have a development task, we are putting up a temporary server, so we can check that one piece of code.
Uhm, it&#39;s not, and this allows us to test in isolation and not see multiple changes in one. To view this deploy, I click view app, it takes me to that temporary server.
The temporary servers will have the same issue ID as the GitLab merge So 5624.metrics.dev, 5624.metrics.dev If you look at this here, it says CU This means that someone else has tested this before, and they have loaded a Chamberlain database to it.
If you see the one of these client names here, it indicates that the client database is already loaded. built for Chamberlain, and we wanted to use their data to test it.
Any of the development servers, we can log in using the dev, insta, dev instances password in one password. And then once I log in, actually for this one I, let me see.
So this might be a server that has. I&#39;m gonna try the Chamberlain password just in case. Okay, so. I&#39;m not able to log into this.
This probably has to do with the issue that we&#39;ve been discussing where clients are deleting. So if that happens, we can make a note on the spreadsheet and move on.
Let&#39;s check it out. check the next one. So for this one, so we have U App and you can see a Metrix Medical Center.
It means that it&#39;s loading a demo database, so it&#39;s not loading a client one. And it should work fine. So we can go through the process of, uh, testing it.
So to test it, these are the instructions. And it has loom video for, each of them should have a loom video.
If it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s okay to hold off on testing it. And then it has acceptance criteria here, testing it, and approving it.
And then, uhm, moving it, and updating the spreadsheet. So, typically we would move this into CodeReview, but for the sake of, uh, uhm, this today, we&#39;ll simply update that spreadsheet.
And I can take a look at it and move some of these to CodeReview at the end of the day.
Another thing we need to note here is, if we go to a branch, and we don&#39;t see the view app button, what we can do is, uhm, click, uh, it, it most likely will be stuck on one of these like, check marks, and then there&#39;s a, there&#39;s gonna be a, a button to redeploy, either on this row, or to the right side
of, uh, deployed on 5, 6, 0, 8, instead of view app, you would see a redeploy button metrics licensed with GitLab only allows us to have certain number of, uhm, uh, issues loaded.
Uhm, so if you have too many things in testing, some of these things maybe need to be redeployed, uh, which will take down one of the other branches, and then put up this one.
Key thing here, is all of this is getting deployed to a dev instance, and, uh, it&#39;s not going to production, so it&#39;s not going to do any damage, uh, if we click to redeploy, uhm, if we need to test it, so, uhm, don&#39;t, don&#39;t, uhm, worry if you need to do that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f493e50378fc41dda464a90ef956f6b4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Bug Fix for Site Name Display Issue in Schedules 🐞</pre></td><td><pre>So, one of the things that, uh, we&#39;re dealing with for MSU is, we have, one of the sites were neat wasn&#39;t you renamed so if I go into schedules and then search, open this one up.
Search for the student. You can see that we have an emergency medicine rotation that is showing Christiana hospital. But if I go to the sites, We only have Christiana healthcare, uhh, care health system.
So this is the site that was renamed, but the actual schedule still shows the old name. We go to, schedules.
And, uh, rotations. And serves for, Christiana, you know, Mercy Medicine. We can see that it&#39;s also showing Christiana healthcare system.
So the reason this is happening is, Umm, on the back- in the back end, but not on the front end, we have a text field.
Umm, a text field called site name on the rotation.
And record. So, rotations. Edit one of these rotations. And we will have, anytime a rotation is linked to a site, we are saving that as a text field for some reason.
And this is, Not, this will not be changed automatically. The only way that this is updated is if the administrator goes in there and relinks the rotation to the site.
So, for this bug fix, what we want to do is remove this, um, name, uh, text field. And then when, when we are viewing the schedules on the grid, we want to make sure that it&#39;s showing the name from the site record itself through the foreign key.
And we&#39;re not showing the text field. It&#39;s. The same thing applies to, uh, this dropdown. It should show the, uh, the site name field from the site record and not from the, uh, text field that&#39;s on the rotation record.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/112872c0764044b4945f8735c6244841</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Workflow Optimization Suggestions</pre></td><td><pre>I like where you&#39;re going with, uh, with the first part of this.

So maybe, Uhm, what we can do is add, say, create Lottery and we can just have the name, dates, roles, defined.
That&#39;ll create the Lottery, then we, say, configure. Uh, configure availability or something like that, takes them to the Lottery page where they can see one, two, three, and it&#39;s not a model as a page, but we&#39;ll have to create the Lottery first before that can be loaded.
Um, so for the second page, the main thing that we need to change here is, every site, I mean, every rotation will have a link to a site.
So if we select multiple sites, this is not going to work well because that&#39;s them saying it&#39;s going to show rotation.
For every, all the selected sites, because they&#39;re, these are linked to these. Um, and then we also want to be able to do this in batch, um, which I think your interface got me thinking about this.
And here&#39;s what I was one, what we can do. On the first page, we already selected the site. And the second page where we can call it, like, set capacity.
Um, what we can do is, for each site. Um, it would be a row, and then they can click to expand it.
When they expand it, it&#39;ll show all the available rotations for that site. And then they can have a little check box for the blocks.
Say, available, available, available, available. And they can punch in a number in here to put in the capacity. So. So, then they can collapse it, open up the next one.
And we can even put a little, uh, summary here. Um, we can say, uh, to four blocks.
With available. Um, um, min, one, max, lock, one, say, basically saying min, uh, that has the lowest availability, max.
Block five has, uh, uh, allows for five students, and that it will be in, let&#39;s say, block three, and then total, only five.
So when this collapse, they&#39;re gonna at least see the stats, so that&#39;s saying this would have, let&#39;s say if I put it- in here an- an numeric value of one is the same one here, and then maybe for here it&#39;s saying- name.
Five, and then we have, nineteen. So this is showing minimum, maximum, and total. So that way they can actually quickly open each of these up, uh, punch in the values and be done with it, and it&#39;s less cl- like-ing or kind of presenting them with almost like a spread sheet-like interface to punch it
in. Um, and we also are going to be capturing side capacity. We can say, umm, s- is, You know, 30.
And then underneath it, we can even say what hub it belongs to, hub, or at least. So that will- I think if we put that as the second page, uhh.
Um, I like- I like, you know, part one, part two. And then finally, for the pre-fills, we could, umm.
The pre-fills, I&#39;m thinking, We&#39;re gonna- they&#39;re gonna be pre-filling for every rotation, I mean, every block of every rotation. So, if we want to show it in, like, a table or a card format, uhh.
Umm, then the card format is gonna be hard to troubleshoot, cause they&#39;ll have, you know, a thousand of these, and they&#39;re gonna- they&#39;re gonna miss things.
But, if we show it as a table, where it shows the rotation name, rotation code, site name, site code, uhh.
Uh, block number with the block dates underneath it, um, and then we have column 4, MS3, MS- and another column for MS2, and they can go in there and, uh, select the students for each of them.
I think that will work if we turn this into- a table, um, and then we can even highlight the rows in orange if it&#39;s- I mean in red if it&#39;s at- at capacity, um, and- and the view that, uh, Rio has built the grid format, we can still- implement it by giving them maybe two tabs here, one for table view,
and another one for, um, a grid view. So they can toggle back and forth if they want to see it in different ways.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dbe7ad7796b84a9698abde262bca820c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Searching Tips with Perplexity</pre></td><td><pre>Hi everyone. I wanted to share this little tip for searching for different types of information. Perplexity is coming up as a popular competitor, popular tool, and it&#39;s seen as the next big competitor for Google when it comes to online search.
Umm, and it&#39;s really powerful when you want to get specific information and don&#39;t want to dig around on different pages.
So, for example, let&#39;s say we have upcoming conferences, when is the ACG. Give me conference this year. Uh, can you give me the links to the registration page, the exhibitor perk.
prospectus and abstract submission page. Thank you very much.
So, essentially, It gives us all the information, and I think, even though it does this as you, it doesn&#39;t give you the links, you can, ,get it from the source details.
So, rather than going to the ACGME&#39;s website and clicking around, it quickly gives up the information. And then also gives you the hyperlinks.
And , Let&#39;s see if we can do something a little more advanced. Next. essentially. Gives me, uhm, the results here. So unlike chat GPT, which is not actively searching online and giving you sources, propexity is looking for- these results online and then linking your references on where it got those results
. Look at that. Weíll be proposed unclear timeline. Sounds like some good schools that we should be reaching out to.
Save that for our, uh, actually. Yeah, I think we&#39;re talking to some of these places already. Uh, save that for our sales meeting.
So anyway, feel free to check it out. Umm, I&#39;ve been finding it very helpful.

I was reviewing the last year&#39;s emails for, uhm, renewal, and I wanted to share a couple things that may have led to this confusion.
Initially, when we sent the invoice, uh, on November 8th of 2023, uh, we had shared, the invoice for 120 students that, from based on the previous years, and then I believe we had a, a phone, uh, a conversation, uhm, via Zoom.
And during that call, we talked about optimization for the, uh, next cohort and how we needed to get those students into the system.
So you had sent this email with different numbers on here. And once we got that email, I had sent over that, a, uh, message that says, assuming that Ross and S.G.
used to work together, we would need 110 modules and 79 partial modules. This is something that we used to do where we would break it up into, uh, depending on different types of students and what specific needs are, now we are doing essentially what we set of, uh, pricing model for all of the students
in the school, mainly because it&#39;s, it&#39;s simpler and it is, every student has access to those modules. Um, and, uh, but given that, um, we have this pricing model in place, uh, for this year, we are still trying to, keeping that as separate, um, which saves the school some money where the, uh, the full
students that are in clinical year are getting all the necessary modules, and then we&#39;re only billing for partial modules for the 79.
So, that was the, uh, email that we confirmed it and then Mark. had sent the second invoice with the updated numbers.
And, uh, once we had, uhm, that sent over. Let&#39;s see, there was, uh, one more correction that was made here, and that ended up being the $34K.
Uhm, this was the final reminder, I think, yeah, $34K. and then you had confirmed that it would be sent to the accounts payable.
So I, I, I think what may have happened, uh, is we had the initial invoice that was sent, and then we talked about adding on the, uh, the incoming cohort so that they can be optimized.
And then we created the updated invoice and shared it based on the, the numbers you had, uh, provided. Um, and essentially what we&#39;re doing is, uh, is renewing for the same, uh, same, uh, set of numbers that we had from last year.
If there are any changes, we can always make the adjustment. Um, please, uh, let me know if this clarifies the, uh, the confusion.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/68b3207a45b74f0f8c7f01e809d16dd4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Bug Reporting Process 🐞</pre></td><td><pre>A default is going to be the, uh, project is dev, and then there&#39;s, the only two that you&#39;ll use is the bug in feature, and if it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;ll show up a template here, and module, it&#39;s going to say, let&#39;s say this is like users, you&#39;re going to be logging in, unable to log in if email has a password

Well, at least I thought I did. Um, but, yeah, there it is. So, this is something that once you put the thing in there, I can, like, use an ad channel, but the ad channel basically alerts everybody and saying this is something that, uh, can one of the developers look at it quickly.
Because it&#39;s preventing a program director from logging in. Yeah. Yeah, so given that it&#39;s Wednesday, I think this is something that, like, I don&#39;t think, since it&#39;s one user and she&#39;s okay.
Hey, with using each email, what I like to do is just give them an explanation. If Chris said this is a Django upgrade thing, you could tell her there was an upgrade that resulted in this.
We&#39;re going to fix it, but it&#39;s going to be, like, by Monday or Tuesday. Okay. And we can have the developers fix it and deployed by Monday.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Uh-huh. The grey things are so warm in the day.

I want to give you some major, uh, points and then the smaller things I don&#39;t want to go into too much detail now because I think, you know, we can get you.
helped tweak that up afterwards or we can tweak it up ourselves. Um, so the, one of the main things was about, um, font size.
So like some of these is using very small font. Um, and I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s best to have the small font.
Smallest font size be size 12 so that the font hierarchy is based on that, um, is having, you know, like, um, having a standard font hierarchy is going to make it look a little bit cleaner.
So for example here we&#39;re using 9, we&#39;re using 8 here, and 11, uhm, so I think the smallest being 12, so when they&#39;re looking at it on a screen it doesn&#39;t look too small.
And then for this page, I think we can break this up into a, uhm, second page. So, have one, one thing here, and then maybe we can add a couple more photos, I can, I can pick out new photos, and then put this into a new page, and then maybe we can even use this page to expand later, uh, to other team
members, or our advisory board. Uhm, so, this is, would be our mission, then would be, you know, healthcare that shows our team, and then our story.
Uhm, they were not fans of this, uh, uhm, drop down, so we can get rid of that. Uhm, then for when we get into, the platform we serve, we needed to add one more, which is veterinary education, instead of four.
And down here, uhm, it looked a, a little busy, and one idea that a team member had was, for each of these, these are meant to be solutions, so we don&#39;t need to have multiple icons in each, so for example, for curriculum, just putting one icon for curriculum, and we don&#39;t need to have these map and delivery
in here. We can just call it curriculum. Uhm, wait for me. The, uh, the, uh, that&#39;s a wait for me.
Pretty good. Yeah. The preclinical, uh, ever since the election, I&#39;ve been, uh, uhm, so then we have clinical, preclinical, and the clinical schedules, you can have one item, and then, I think that&#39;ll clean it up a little bit.
Those are the main items that, uh, we had as, uh, feedback. And I also, we, we wanted to keep this background as a darker blue because that is more aligned with the, uh, the original blue that we had.
So with that feedback, I think, uh, we can continue with the rest of the slides, and then if there are additional items that come up, we could, uh, always do it after the conference because we are going to have this conference this week.
It would be great if we can get, uh, even if the early version of this is done.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/af75da78db264edbb1d1642b307fb756</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Building Complex Components with AI</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Elson, I wanted to, uhm, share something with you, uhm, I, uhm.
Let&#39;s see. Nope, not that Can&#39;t seem to find it.
Yeah, that&#39;s why. No, this one, okay. So, one of the things that I was, uhm, attempting to do here was, if we can use these, eh, eh, the AIs to build more common complex components that we can standardize and reuse.
Uhm, so, for example, I want to create a Vue 3 component for viewing PDFs. Think like a UX expert, right?
So, I would ask it to create a plan, and then I would, once I have the plan, I can review it and say, uhm, what do I want to, so I&#39;m going to say, go ahead and, uh, implement it.
So it, it, uh, wrote the code to implement it. Create a document, uhm, uh, documentation for developers.
And then, I would say, I would, then I would ask, uh, it to see if there&#39;s a way to improve the code, and then apply that, those changes.
So there&#39;s a, there&#39;s a, first phase is ask it to plan it out, which allows it to create an outline, without actually writing code.
It&#39;s essentially recreating the normal development process. I&#39;m saying, write the specs, then write the code, then, uhm, review the code to see if we can optimize it.
And then the, then the documentation, and so then we will have the code that&#39;s been optimized and then documented. Uhm? Since chat GPT only shows previews, of the finalized, I mean, ah, versions in React, uhm, I can&#39;t see the previews of the Vue versions.
Uhm, so I created three components. Here, one for the text input, like text fields, another one for handling CSV import, so, and addressing a bunch of different validations that we have to do.
and this this has both the code and the documentation, and also for a simple PDF viewer. So, when you&#39;re, you know, doing some experiments with it, it will be awesome if you can give me your thoughts on this approach.
Uhm, and the other thing that we can also consider is, since a lot of the AI tools are using React to generate things, uhm, if we&#39;re doing a full refactoring into a new app, should we consider React?
And I think in the past when we talked about it, the decision was to stick with Vue, and if you look through the code here, you can check to see how good of a code it&#39;s writing for Vue, and if, if you still want to stick with that, again, I, this is not a decision that I want to make, I think this should
be something that&#39;s made by the team. The developers, uhm, so, ehm, but we should decide based on where the company and the product will be in the next five to ten years, uhm, so these are three components that you can take a look at, and the idea here is to see if we can use, uhm, uhm, the AI to plan
out more complex components that we need. And, and, things like CSV import has always been a problem at Metrix because there&#39;s a lot of different types of errors that can happen, and each time we do an import, we have a separate validation that we&#39;re doing for all of it, and we don&#39;t have a standardized
way that we&#39;re handling it. Now, in the past, uh, we have tried to use, like, third-party plugins, which hasn&#39;t worked, uhm, so, so if we can build a standardized component that we can customize for each import easily, that would solve a lot of problems.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0be1fda57b954ee988ed29e735707e5f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Generating MSPE Letters 📄</pre></td><td><pre>Once we have all of the components of an MSPE letter and charts all configured, we have imported the data, then we can start generating actual letters.
So this assumes you created the templates, you have created chart templates, we have generated all the charts, and then we&#39;re going to be putting all this together.
To do that, you go under Gradebook, Generate MSPE, and on this page, we would select the template we want to use, the group, and then click on Generate Documents for Group.
I guess. It&#39;s going to, uh, say, Documents are in the queue. It&#39;s going to generate that document, and it&#39;s going to email you when that generation is done.
You can see under here, it says Members in the group is 1. It means that one letter will be generated.
There we go, we have that generated. Uhm, once we have it generated, we can go in there, click the Action button, Preview it.
This brings it up in a document viewer. It&#39;s a PDF viewer. We can also click Edit Document under Actions. Call, uh, dropdown, which allows me to open it up in an editable format and make changes to it.
Formatting or fixed typos and so on. There&#39;s also a history that shows an audit of all of the changes that were submitted.
There is a change status. Metrics allows administrators to manage different statuses for their letters. By default, it&#39;s draft when it&#39;s created.
After changes are made, you can either save it needs remediation, or approved, or approved with changes. So if we change that status, the nice thing is that if you need to regenerate the letters, you can skip the ones that are in approved status so you don&#39;t accidentally overwrite some of the changes
that you made manually. Regenerate allows you to regenerate that one document. Remember that when you regenerate this, it&#39;s simply populating all of the text and the same images.
Let&#39;s say if you added new grades into the system, it&#39;s not going to calculate the chart again as part of the regeneration process.
Then we have a send email option. We can write a subject line, message, and then choose one of the recipients.
The subject line allows us to email this, uh, document to one or more individuals. We have an option to download this under the action column as a PDF or as a docx.
If you want to, send this out to all the students. At the top right, there is an email documents for group button, which allows us to, uhm, select the, set the document name.
This is going to be the, uh, merge fields that we use here. Last name, first name, and so on. We can also say, how do we want to send it as a document?
Which evaluation templates do we want to include if we wanted them to provide feedback on this? You know, let&#39;s say we create a form to give us feedback on the MSPE letter.
We can attach that as a, as a link, uh, when you send out this, uh, email, uh, with the document attached.
You have a sender label, email, sender email, so this allows us to enter your school&#39;s email or name so that it looks like this letter is coming from the school, subject line, and some sample text at the bottom.
You&#39;ll, this can be edited as you see fit. Uhm, there&#39;s also this, you a second option to say email zip of documents.
This is meant to, uh, email the full document set to somebody if they need to have the, everything downloaded to upload to ERAS.
So our recommendations when working, best practices working with these documents is to if you&#39;re going to be reviewing this with the student in a zoom call or in person, um, pull this up in front of them in metrics with the editor, have them go through it and make any changes.
And then you can go ahead and approve that while they&#39;re still sitting there. As long as you change the status next time, if someone needs to regenerate something, the changes that you made is protected.
Also, when emailing this out to them, it&#39;s always best to, uh, send it out to them as a PDF and then ask for feedback in an evaluation.
If there are any changes to be made, it&#39;s best to do it on your end rather than asking the students to edit the document directly.
When you have students that are finishing rotations late and you have to create these, uh, the students at the later time, you would add them, put the grades in, add them to the user group, and manually generate their letters.
Uhm, and add them to the, to the, uhm, documents. The, essentially, uhm, This is, this is a process that, Is a little tedious, and our support team will typically help you out with creating these charts.
Uhm, in the future, we&#39;re going to have a way to regenerate charts for one student at a time, so that it&#39;s, if these late students are submitting grades after the main cohort had their chart generated, you don&#39;t want to have to regenerate the same charts over and over, especially after the review process
. If you regenerate all of them, the charts may be slightly different. So in the future, we&#39;re going to have a way to generate this one by one, if a student needs to submit this at a later time.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d23496271f584396855d1d2b4dd79adf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding MSPE Template Fields</pre></td><td><pre>Here we&#39;re going to take a look at a standard MSPE template and some of the different, some of the merge fields in it and, ah, where that information is typically stored.
So looking at this template in our system, under, system, under, uhm, institutional portal, documents, templates, and I&#39;ve opened up our standard, ah, AAMC MSPE template.
So let&#39;s go through this one by one. At the top we have first name, last name. This is stored in the user demographics of that student.
So to access this, you would We&#39;ll go into Users. page and click on the student, click Edit Demographics, and you&#39;ll see the first and last name that you can edit.
Noteworthy characteristics are typically set up as custom fields on their demographics. So, in Metrics, you can create custom demographic fields for users and custom demographic fields for the student.
This can be done in the Institutional Portal, under System Setup, Custom Fields. So, we typically would create three custom fields, one for each of the noteworthy characteristics, have it in the student&#39;s profile, and they can go ahead and fill it out.
Then we have, uh, Academic History, Initial Matriculation Date, Estimated Graduation, uh, Expected Graduation Date, and, uh, any Remediation Coursework, Adverse Actions, Prior Institution.
These would all be, uh, living as part of the demographic information also. Uhm, this can be, uh, uhm, uh, created as custom, uh, fields.
And, uh, used to store that information. So we create these as custom fields. You can also import them in bulk.
As we scroll down. We go to the preclinical coursework here. You have first name. And then some information that&#39;s going in here.
Uh, class rank, class rank total. These are all coming from, uh, their demographic information as a custom field. Then we have a chart.
MSPE chart, uh, so this chart information is actually coming from a document in their profile. So if you open up a student&#39;s profile, there&#39;s a documents tab.
Documents, it&#39;s called documents and certifications. On that page, you&#39;re going to have start to see these image files that are getting attached to them.
Based when an MSPE letter is generated and what we&#39;re doing here is inserting that chart into this, uhm, letter. Next, we have clerkships and you can see here this has a great block.
What this is doing is a group of merge fields that are inserted in a certain way. So that it can repeat itself and insert grades for each rotation.
So essentially, this one set of, uhm, one set of, uhm, merge fields is going to repeat for every single clerkship that we need to put grades into.
And it also shows up in chronological order. And if we change something in here, you know, let&#39;s say we want to bold this, it&#39;s going to repeat that bold for every single grade that we populate in here.
And then we have another one for, you know, for mandatories, another one for electives. Other charts also appear here in the same format.
We have a competency chart. This is a separate image that is stored as a file on the document&#39;s profile. So, essentially, each of these merge fields are coming from the student&#39;s demographic information, custom files.
Those are the major areas that you&#39;re pulling in data to create the MSBE letter.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3e66eae3b9b14e99b797394a39521893</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Data Management and Training Agenda Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>So, all issues, I&#39;m gonna go, they have an AI search now, so I&#39;m gonna say, issues that have type equals feature that has been.

2021, don&#39;t, nope. So let&#39;s go with that. So after January 2021, so it basically gave me a search for that and we have, uhm, wow.
So we save this fill, uhm. Go. Yeah, I mean a lock is a lot is actually a good thing, which means that where we have more data.

So. Client doesn&#39;t really matter, actually. Well, no, client does. Oh, it was, yeah, it was released for this.
Yeah, I would organize this table, like, if I were to open this up going to one of these meetings, I would sort it A to Z so I could highlight the ones that I&#39;m that we did for that client that I was talking about.
Yeah, so. Because that would be the starting point, like, which ones did they request that they&#39;re now getting a bunch of value out So here is, uhm, actually, I think there is a slightly better way to do this, uh, just so that it&#39;s reusable.
We have Sheets. I forgot about this thing in here. So I&#39;m going to just copy this query, and And then back to Projects, Sheets.
And then I&#39;m going to say, Create Sheet, Buy Annual Marketing Review. Ah, crap.
I&#39;m just going to have it open. What&#39;s this one? Stop. Can you guys hear me?
I miss you guys. I feel like I don&#39;t get to see you anymore since we don&#39;t have to huddle. Well, hold on.
I&#39;ll give you the gift of being able to see me. I&#39;m not going to be in my G-state. Why don&#39;t we, Actually, I was going to say if we want to move this to next week, it&#39;s fine.
Then, Chris is not back either, uhm, we can do this next week when he&#39;s back. So, because I think with, it&#39;s kind of a good meeting we have everybody, or at least most people that are actually talking to customers, because I don&#39;t really have much to add.
I&#39;m just here to listen. Well, I think real quick while we&#39;re here, uhm, Mark, is there anything, uh, that you had for this meeting that you just really need to know real quick?
Yeah, that&#39;s a good point. Uh, I, I have one that you can share.
You can that. That will affect our advocate percentage. You can, you can also change Florida. Florida Department of Health to Advocate.
Wow. We&#39;re gonna pop some champagne. Yeah, all I want to know is I&#39;ve been going back and forth with McHill for the past, like, month.
They&#39;re in a, they&#39;re in a rough spot trying to reboot their program, and he is insanely grateful that I&#39;ve been taking my time, even though they&#39;re a small contract.
Yeah, and actually make a note to yourself, Mark. I&#39;m gonna be making an introduction, uh, once they send some of their documents over, uhm, that they will need a light training session.
Uhm, that I can join and help with if, uh, if no one else has time, uh, cause essentially their entire program essentially stopped, and then a bunch of people left and got hired.
So we just have to verify people&#39;s access and permissions, and then give them a brief tutorial on, like, rotation schedules and emails and stuff.
This would probably, uhm, it would be in December most likely. So let me give you a rough estimate date range.
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh. It would probably be. I would actually say it might happen during the retreat at some point.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d0da3e677a0149bd9e7945d0ca1551d0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>iOS recording - 17 Sep 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Clara, I&#39;m on my phone. Let&#39;s see if this works. So I really like the overall design. Um, the only thing I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a wave, but what, well, as a couple of things I&#39;m wondering, uh, at the top, uh, survey results slash dash evaluation KPI&#39;s, um, and then the question underneath.
I don&#39;t think we need both. Um, we can just put that a question in the is in a very, um, larger font and give her to the survey results.
Because by looking at this, they&#39;ll know what their survey results are, that it is our results. And the question came to me, what is your training program&#39;s current goal for evaluation completion?
and then for the background it&#39;s better I like to keep it simple and minimalistic with a lot of white space so like we don&#39;t need to have that pattern in the background and then we can put the metrics a little on the right side, then my headshot and Tosh, I mean a name on the right, on the left side,
the company logo on the right side, my image and name. So it&#39;s both personal and business-branded.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/80bb05ff7b8b4692b09048e74f346000</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leading Discussions and Assigning Responsibilities</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Katie So The reason I wanted to make a little video is I like you to get used to leading these kind of discussions with Chris and Rio.
I mean, sorry, Chris and Maria Kind of present the problem and then, uhm, lead the discussion to get to a, eh, solution and then also, uhm, make sure that one person is responsible for each of those items and then, uhm, uhm, eh, eh, the, uhm, uh, the due date for each.
So, for example, affiliation agreements, what, when you, when you meet with them, what do you want to say to, uhm, uhm, this is more of a Chris, this item, uhm, we can say, we got, uhm, multiple vet schools that&#39;ll have several thousand, uhm, uhm, affiliation agreements they will need to import.
We obviously, uhm, don&#39;t want them to be uploading each of these one by one, uhm, do we have a way for us to batch import these, and one of the things that we can do is ask them to name the files a certain way, so it makes it easier for the first question is whether if there is a tool that we already
have, uuhm, if it doesn&#39;t, uhm, is it something that, uh, we can have it created so that when we do onboarding, we can do these batch uploads for the main, in, uuuh.
Yeah, for them. Cause it will happen over and over. For the side code recommendations, this is something that you can give to Maria, and I don&#39;t think she needs any instructions, you just need to, uhm, a son.
On a due date, and then have her create it. Essentially, what we want to do is, if the site name has multiple words in it, take the first initial of each of those words and just put it together to make the code.
For schedules, umm. I would actually, I know I said I was gonna review it.
I would and I will if I have time. But I think this is something that Chris, Maria. Or, and you can work together in that call to decide what&#39;s the best way to put this into metrics.
Umm, it&#39;s best to go over it in a call. Uh, because we want to make sure we get the best outcome.
Umm, and uh, once you come up with the approach, you can, it&#39;s what we want to come up with is, how do we structure the block schedules?
Meaning, are we going to have one schedule with all the students on it? Or are we going to have separate schedules?
Umm, and then, within those schedules, how do we put the block dates? Or is it going to be, um, do we have the block started and date for each of them, and so on?
So once we come up with the structure, I can look at it and make sure that I&#39;m okay with, I&#39;m out of a process.
The same way, um, but this is good practice to come up with it, with Eucharist and, uh, Maria. Um, for the evaluations and EPA&#39;s, so the way that, uh, Let me see if I can, um, explain, uh, So, what we need to do is, I think what we will need to do is- uhm, extract each of these questions that are in
here and create them. As. Create a category in question bank and create all of these questions with these options.
And we can also create a. Um, comment question for each of the unique comment questions. Once we have that, we will need to, um, import these EPA&#39;s.
As, um, as, um,-competencies. So we&#39;ll put the- These are subcompetencies.
We&#39;ll have a- a core competency called EPA&#39;s. And the- inside of those car competencies, we&#39;ll have each of these as subcompetencies.
And when we create the forms, we&#39;re going to import. These questions.
And- so when I create the anesthesia, uh, question, I mean, form, I would import each of these questions.
And then- Umm, add a section header. Here, let me see if I can do this. So the question, Hank. Thank you, We would have a category.
Sorry. EPA questions. And we&#39;re gonna add a- a question under EPA question called.
All And, okay, so the scale is.
and exceeds expectations.
issues. Save. And the next one. It&#39;s 130. So.
You will create these all of them. Come and play. And then go to questions. I mean, uh, templates, rotation based one, anesthesia.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/170c3b58197a4470a8407195197b2606</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Preferences and Scheduling Optimization 📅</pre></td><td><pre>So, to create a new lottery, essentially, we go to, uh, schedules, lottery on the admin portal and then from here we can click new lottery, give it a name called medical student lottery, and then there&#39;s going to be a few fields like open date, which is going to be the date that the students can submit
preferences, close date is when the students can no longer enter preferences, run date is going to be the rate, date the algorithm runs to generate the schedule.
Uh, but again, our algorithm currently does not work, we need to fix it, but, so this is kind of irrelevant.
Then we say which students do we want to include in the lottery. I&#39;m going to choose MS3 and MS4, third and fourth year students.
Which sites do you want to include? So I&#39;m going to say these two sites, our clients will have more than two sites.
I&#39;m going to save it. So this is medical student lottery, opens in five days, and then this is where the UX of this needs to be improved where there&#39;s the UX of product.
So the UX of the product needs to be So, if I click, on the phase one, if I click edit, it allows me to edit whatever I just set up.
So what I have to do now is click advance phase. Phase two doesn&#39;t apparently do anything. Uhm, so then now you gotta go to phase three, which now activates the ability to create blocks.
So, ideally, in my opinion, when, soon as you create it, there is no need to go to phase one, two, three, we should just let them, take them directly to the place that they can create the blocks.
And then if I click blocks, I can come in here and say, add block. So, this is going to be, I&#39;m going pick one of this, and when I pick a site, it&#39;s going to give me the rotations that are available for that site.
This is coming from the schedules rotations page. Any rotation that I have created in the system that is mapped to this site will be given me, given to me in the drop down.
So. If I go to rotations here, and I choose Metrics Hospital Westside, so, so you can see cardiology rotation. That&#39;s the only one that I&#39;ve created that is mapped to that.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m only getting one here. Roles allowed, it&#39;s going to give me the roles that I have selected in the Rotary.
But I&#39;m going to say, this one is only allowed for MS3. Start date and end date. So right now, it&#39;s giving me, uhm, whatever dates here.
One of the things that would be nice for a customer is, if we had a way to create, a standardized set of blocks, uhm, so we, we said, block 1 is July 1st to July 28th, block 2 is July 3rd to 4th, so that every time I create a block here, I don&#39;t have to keep selecting dates.
Because, if I had somewhere else, like, let&#39;s say if I go to lottery and I just had, have a tab that says manage blocks, and when I create the lottery, if I select the block set that I want to include, then I can come in here and just click a little check box that says this is for block 1, this, uhm,
so that I don&#39;t have to keep centering the dates. That&#39;s a pain in the butt. It&#39;s a minor problem, I mean it&#39;s a medium problem, because we gave them the ability to import blocks using a spreadsheet, kind of takes care of it.
Uh, but for right now, if you want to do it manually, you would select the start date and end date, and it&#39;s going to say, this, we&#39;re going to allow for 2 student, 2 slots.
So this is saying, 2 students can be at this block. At this site, for this rotation. In our Excel file, we don&#39;t really specify rotations, because rotation names are kind of captured with the site.
But in Metrix, we have to specify that separately. So, so I created one site, rotation combination with slot, and this is giving you start date and end date.
Now, was those states pre-filled when you selected that rotation? Yeah, I think it&#39;s randomly getting pre-filled. I don&#39;t know what the criteria is.
Okay, I was just wondering. Yeah. So, yeah. If I wanted to enter this for a first block, it might be that, but then for the next block, I&#39;ll need to go in there and manually select.
So here&#39;s a flaw right here, where it doesn&#39;t allow me to select anything in the future, unless, so I gotta set the end date first before I send the, it&#39;s backwards, so.
which is not intuitive at all. Add, so I have two blocks added, and if I want to edit this, it&#39;s going to bring it up here.
Uhm, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m so excited, so it won&#39;t let me do anything here for the start date. That&#39;s weird.
Yeah, so I think really messing with these dates here is not good, because people shouldn&#39;t be tinkering with this every single slot.
They should just go in there and say, our block structure is this, because they&#39;re always going to be the same.
It&#39;s going to stay the same start date and end date for every block. They should just be able to select what block they want to use.
So, block 1, 2, 3, and 4 will all be the same dates. Yeah. They want whatever. They&#39;re just going to pick block 1, block 2, block 3.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ffd305b7cda9491fb7e797cd0a78f6b6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Progress on Menu Customization 👩‍💻</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Elson. Just want to say I love the progress you made on the menu. Looks awesome. And, uhm, I want to, for you.
Oh, I love this too. It&#39;s awesome. Black, dark mode. She wanted to show you this. Let&#39;s see if I can, This, uhm, to see if we can, incorporate some of these, uh, items.
One of the things that our users, uhm, tend to struggle with is if we have all of the menu items, enabled, then it can be a, a lot for the customer to use, uhm, with this, uh, I was experimenting.
With a way for us to have, uhm, some flexibility, one thing is being able to turn on and off different menu items based on what modules they bought.
If they didn&#39;t buy all the modules, we want to have a shorter menu, and depending on the portal, different menu items will be disabled.
Uhm, So, if, uhm, and then, that&#39;s the first thing that we would control, and the second thing is it&#39;d be nice if there&#39;s a way for them to, uhm, bookmark, uhm, certain things that they use frequently so they can show up in the favorites.
We don&#39;t need this recently visited thing. I think it was the AI that added it. It&#39;s not good. And then, it also added a bunch of these icons, which I think, I don&#39;t like a lot.
And then, I don&#39;t think we need icons for every submenu. Or we can use the same icon for the submenu.
Uhm, whatever looks better. We don&#39;t need to have different icons for every submenu item. And one of the things that I did, it also added was a way to search.
So if they want to find something. And, I&#39;m also leading the us simplifying our top menu. Instead of having institutional, admin, and personal.
If we can, uhm, if we do, when we redo the system, we just have an admin and a personal account.
And then admin can have different things appear based on the level of access. So if they&#39;re a higher level of institutional administrator, they may see more items than the ones that are regular admin items.
And then at the top, we also would need a way to toggle between different portals, sorry, different programs. So.
Or departments, whatever you want to call it. So this allows them to switch between them. And some of our clients also want to put their logo at the top.
So instead of us, uhm, All right. Showing our logo, it would be nice for us to show their logo and then have a little smaller, we have a favicon of our M.
That we can use for our logo. So if the client has uploaded a logo, it&#39;ll show up there with ours as like, a smaller logo and then if the client hasn&#39;t uploaded it, then it&#39;ll show our logo.
And then on the bottom left, we also have a way to access the knowledge base.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8a43cee778944e8bb5ce0ab023d9953b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Users, Groups, and Grades Management in Medtrics 📊</pre></td><td><pre>We&#39;re going to take a look at some of the imports that we have to do in order to make sure The MSPE letter is generated correctly We&#39;ll start with the users page Every year as part of the MSPE Season if you&#39;re using metrics for all of your academic data, you would already have your graduating cohort
in metrics. If you&#39;re using metrics only for the MSPE module, then you would have to create all of the students that are graduating as part of that year&#39;s class.
So what we would do is go into the users page and instead of creating each of these users one by one, we can use the import users with CSV option here.
This allows you to download a sample CSV and then fill it out and submit it, uh, in order to import it.
One of the key things to note here is the import template allows you to import standard fields, as well as custom fields.
And you don&#39;t have to import all of this information at once. Instead, you can start with creating as much of the information you have, as long as you import the student&#39;s email address.
And, and, or a student ID, then it&#39;s going to create that record, and next time you can simply use that email record, email ID, or ID number to match to the existing user, and it&#39;ll update those other fields that you&#39;re, you need to add later.
If you ever need to manually change any information for a student, you can simply go to the user&#39;s page, click on a student, click edit demographics, and then go through the tabs at the, at the top of the, uh, to switch to the different sections, and fill in the necessary information, information.
So that&#39;s how we create users each year. Next, we would want to, uhm, create groups. So groups are going to contain all of the learners that are graduating that year.
To create them manually, you create them manually. You the group, new group, and then once you have the group created, let&#39;s click on new group, you give it a name, say MSBE Cohort 2025, and we can say this is going to be a, uh, academic, linked to a specific academic period, because this is for this
graduating class. And you don&#39;t need this group to always be visible in the future. So select it, select the current academic period, and it&#39;s going to allow you to link it to that.
And for sites and group tags, you can leave that blank. Once you, once you have the group created, you click on it, then click add members, and you can add all of your graduating students into it.
If you don&#39;t want to be creating all of these manually one by one, there is an upload groups button at the top where you can download a template.
And then once the template is downloaded, fill it in with all of the students that you need to create, and then click upload and it&#39;ll create all those students, all those groups, and, uhm, add them to the, it will create all those groups and then link them.
Add the students to those groups if you have those students in the template. Next is grades. So to import grades into Metrix, you go to gradebook, grades, uhm, that&#39;s where you import things.
But every year, it&#39;s important to double check you have all of the, uh, systems set up correctly. So to do that, go to gradebook, set up.
And on this page, we want to double check all of the different courses, preclinical, and all of the clerkships, both the rotational rotations and the electives, uh, rotation, mandatory rotations and electives.
Make sure the code for these courses and rotations are correct, the name is correct, number of credits and number of weeks is correct.
And if there are any changes to be made, it&#39;s best to do this before you start importing grades. Once the grades are ready to be imported, you go to gradebook, click import grades with CSV, and then you can download one of the templates that we provide, fill it in with all of the necessary information
, this includes, uh, matching codes to those grade set, uh, gradebook set up in here. Uhm, always, for that gradebook, uh, grade, uh, set up, uh, for codes, it&#39;s best to use the same codes that you have in your student information system.
This way it&#39;s easy to match it up. So we download the template, we fill it in, and then we come in here and do an upload and it&#39;ll populate it into Metrix.
The upload template allows you to enter all of the information, including, uh, the, uh, link it to the person, choose the appropriate grade of course rotation using the, uh, course orientation using its code, the date of the grade, and you can also enter the date the, uhm, the rotation itself, so where
it was a site-specific rotation, uhm, that&#39;s coming from the, the, the site and rotation that is offered, it has a unique code, start date and end of the rotation, end date, end date of the rotation as well as the number of weeks, the score, Type, which you can define in metrics by going to the setup
, gradebook setup, and then one of the, uh, score type tab, so this is meant to capture different types of, uh, scores you can enter for MSPE, main thing you need is the final grade entered, then there&#39;s a primary status, and that&#39;s a secondary status, primary status could be pass, fail, high honors,
and so on, secondary status could be if your school uses it, a, you know, letter grade, you can kind of customize both the primary status and secondary status in the gradebook setup, uhm, when you import, you&#39;re also able to import the precepts.
They&#39;re comments, both the original as well as the revised comments, and then once it&#39;s created, you also have the ability to go into the grade itself and make, uh, add attachments.
So let&#39;s say you have these grades added to metrics, uh, for most of the students and and then you start to get some.
Changes or new grades, uh, one by one, you can always go into the gradebook, grades page, and then manually add a score.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6b7b42cb96dd47dbbe8b7f9a7084385f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Electric Cars Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>You like to chat with me, or everything else?

So if we take a look at a MSPE, letter, we&#39;re going to have various charts that we want to insert into it, and each of these charts is going to show some data about their performance.
To create chart templates in Metrix, so the way that, uhm, Metrix works is you are able to define different types of chart templates, then you create a set of students that have grades data in Metrix, and then you use that template.
To dynamically create separate charts for each student that is graduating, you, ah, you know, whoever is in the cohort is placed into a group, and then Metrix would generate images for that student using that chart template, and stored in the student&#39;s profile.
Uhm, to get started, we would go into the admin tab, admin portal, this is now not in the institutional portal, this is in the admin portal, go to on the left menu to documents, charts, and here I can create a new chart, and then we would give it a name, let&#39;s say course specific chart, And we can give
it a title, subtitle, this is what shows up on the image when the chart is generated. And then at the bottom we have five different options for charts we can create.
First chart is the aggregate course chart. This chart, it shows a bar chart of all of the different charts, I mean different grades that they had and you can choose the different courses you want to include.
The idea here is to use it for your preclinical courses. You have one chart that summarizes all of their preclinical course.
It also shows peer comparison. Then we have course-specific chart. This creates separate images for each course they have, uh, that you want to show the grades for.
It&#39;s typically used for your rotations. So every rotation would have a separate chart with the grades. The trainees&#39; grades and, uh, uh, comparison to their peers.
Next chart called exam score chart. It actually takes, uhm, the student&#39;s exam scores, which can be found in the user&#39;s profile.
Under exam scores, this is meant to capture standardized exams or GPAs, and we can create GPA charts or exam, uh, standardized exams, uh, scores, uhm, and save that in as a chart with quartiles in a quartile format.
Oh, sorry. It&#39;s, uh, I believe it&#39;s a bar, bar graph. And then there&#39;s also an exam score quartile chart that you can use to, uh, show the same data as a quartile.
And then there&#39;s a competency quartile chart. This allows you to show their core competencies, sub-competence, I mean, their core competencies and, uh, in a quartile format.
So, for this example, let&#39;s choose an aggregate course chart, continue, and then we can define which courses we want to include.
We can choose one or more. And this is showing the graded course rotations in the system, which can be configured under, uh, gradebook.
Set up. Then we have the x-axis label, font size for the x-axis label, option to hide that data label, and you have y-axis label, font size, and then, uh, min and max value for the y-axis if you want to, uhm, uhm, make sure that it&#39;s not, it&#39;s, the size is reasonable.
And we can show this information as percentages or counts. So the number of people that got pass, number of people that got fail, versus if it&#39;s a percentage of what&#39;s the average for that particular course.
Then the next section we can divide it define the bar chart size in pixels, uhm, and then the column width, column padding.
On the next, uh, we can define the grades and the grade statuses to be displayed on the generator chart, which allows us to define the color, complete it.
Uhm, You can also define custom, uhm, hex codes for completed, failed, pass, these are showing statuses from the gradebook.
And then for the trainee, and the trainee&#39;s marker, we can also define a custom color code. Similar to what we have in the chart here, we can put an arrow above the learner&#39;s, uh, the bar graph that represents the student.
So, for example, if, if the school has these honors, high pass, pass, and fail as the options for their grade, then this arrow indicates that the learner that we&#39;re looking at, the student that we&#39;re looking at, had an honors.
And at the bottom, you can define which category, document category do you want this file to be saved as. Remember, when we create these files, they&#39;re saved as images, attached to a document category, and it&#39;s the document category that&#39;s used as a merge field to insert this letter, this document into
the letter. So, we went over aggregate charts, but the other charts are similar, and you can configure the settings, and then create these chart templates.
Once, go to a different place, and once these chart templates are created, and then we can go click on generate for one of these charts, and then choose a student cohort and click generate charts and email confirmation.
When we click that button, so essentially what I did was I went to documents charts on the left menu. Then I see the templates, and I click generate in one of the charts.
And I choose one of the student groups, and then create, uh, click the generate charts and email, email confirmation button.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4c92b3c7553487ebd427ce53fa11c60</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Optimizing Rotation Assignments</pre></td><td><pre>Preferences, I, I don&#39;t know what, we got to think about that, I can&#39;t think of it right now, but, Preference automator, it, it gets into the length of the thing, Rio&#39;s gonna, Rio&#39;s gonna have a heart attack if it goes into two lines, so, but, if we call it automation, at least on the admin side, it
makes more sense, because we&#39;re using it for optimization, too. Lottery is, like, very minor, a small feature compared to optimization.
So, let&#39;s, let&#39;s create a new lottery here, and I&#39;ll tell you all the problems that I have, and, uhm, uh, Ken.
Ken. Are you familiar with the lottery feature in Metrix? So, I&#39;m going to just go through this real quick, you can listen in.
Uhm, and what I&#39;m going to do is start from the beginning. So, the lottery functionality in Metrix is built so that, medical schools, veterinary schools can automatically generate the schedule, it&#39;s uhm, and I&#39;m, I&#39;m recording this, I can, uhm, we can turn this into an article later, uhm, so, it, it,
it allows schools to give students a, uhm, uhm, way to submit their rank preferences of rotations, so that a randomized algorithm will assign them to a rotation.
So, they, they enter the capacity, they enter the available slots, student ranks it, and then algorithm will assign it. In reality, uhm, our algorithm doesn&#39;t work.
The reason why is because we built the lottery functionality, we built the lottery years ago, nobody used it, and then when they actually needed to use it, they didn&#39;t need the lottery, the clients said they wanted optimization.
Which is a much more complex process, and we ends up, so the difference is that optimization and lottery is that, um, a lottery, um, a lot of- lottery algorithm, essentially, the way that it works is, um.
Let me see, maybe this one. No pictures. I want a picture. . . . . So the way that it works is, basically, the simplest is that you have a hundred students, and each of them has submitted ten preferences each.
What the, uh, lottery, there&#39;s a couple of different lottery algorithms in existence. And a lot of these algorithms optimization come from computer science research.
They basically standardize, like, published papers on algorithms. And, um, so one of the ways to do a lottery is you take the hundred students, you randomize them using a randomization process, take the first student, and then give them their top reference.
Then randomize the students again, take another student, give them their first preference. So you kind of just go through the randomization assignment, randomization assignment cycle until you are done with all those students and all their required slots.
Okay. Problem with that is, it&#39;s not going to- You result in the best schedule possible. Some people may get screwed because the algorithm is not keeping track of how many students are getting their top preferences, how many are not.
Uh, it&#39;s just randomizing and picking top preferences and just running through. Uh, but there- you know, there&#39;s other algorithms that may increase that probability but- they still get less suck in the long run when you&#39;re dealing with large numbers of students.
Optimization, on the other hand, how it works is you put in student preferences. So, actually, this is a good chance.
Uh, so I&#39;m gonna pull up optimizer input. So, and, so if I look at the optimizer, umm, and also pull up one more thing here, Here. Let&#39;s see, eight, five, six, seven.
Well done. Verify I&#39;m a human. I cannot promise that. So, this is, uh, GitLab. Um, I&#39;m gonna go into, Projects. Uh, and we think we, uh, yeah, Optimizer.
Clients. Okay, let me repeat here. Okay, so, I&#39;m gonna have- This open, and then I&#39;m gonna go back to- You here.
So the way that optimization works is we use a lottery functionality in metrics to collect a bunch of information, but we&#39;re not actually running the lottery algorithm, which is why the lottery hasn&#39;t mattered much.
The fact that it&#39;s broken because we&#39;re just using it to collect a bunch of things and then exporting the data.
We&#39;re running it to the optimizer, which is a standalone product. So for the optimizer, there are a few things that we organize the data for before we give it to the app.
So on this spreadsheet, there&#39;s multiple tabs at the bottom. The first thing here, sites. So this shows every single hospital that they have in that network that is accepting students during the next academic year.
And each site has a site ID or a site code, site name. And then maximum students, what that means is, what&#39;s the maximum number of students that can be at that site from this school per block?
So if you have 12 blocks in a year, and it says one, it means that at any given time from LMU, you can have one student.
But, during the whole year, they can have up to 12, because there&#39;s 12, 12 slots. Next input is, um, the subjects.
The subjects is going to store the courses, or rotations that are being offered. We call it subject to keep a generic, because, Sometimes we&#39;re optimizing for course, sometimes we&#39;re optimizing for rotations.
So, if we have subject code, rotation name, rotation ID, and here, there&#39;s something called slots. So, the slots is basically a comma-separated list of numbers.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cb1d4fc4c7de4f4abf9d40e9339822b9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Getting Started with MSPE Module</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to get started with the MSPE module. For the first part, we&#39;re going to focus on the setup of the text template.
There are text templates we have to create, chart templates we have to create. So we&#39;re going to start with the text portion of the letter.
To do that, we go to the Institutional Portal, under Documents, Merge Fields, we&#39;re going to see, uhm, several type of merge fields in here.
What we&#39;re going to do is review the different types of merge fields that we offer, and then also some of the ones that we want to create for the MSP e-letter.
When we&#39;re on the Merge Fields page, we have Active and Inactive at the top, so if we want to switch to the inactive merge fields, I can toggle in, or I can go to the active and see all the active ones.
Let&#39;s say we want to create a new field. We can give the, click on the new field button, this ring of stars.
It opens the new field page, where I can give it a name, then I can choose the type of field, so text field allows us to insert this into a document as a merge field, and then when this merge field is, when the document is being generated, the administrator that generates the document is able to type
in something into this field, that&#39;s why it&#39;s a text field. So let&#39;s say you&#39;re creating a contract and you want the administrator to type in the salary of this person, and everything else is going to be standardized, but they&#39;re able to adjust the salary each time.
Then there is a select field. A select field allows you to have drop-downs, uh, drop-down options. So this, again, if you want to do the salary in a way that it&#39;s not editable by the administrator, they can&#39;t type it in, but they can select one of the salaries that you would use the select field, and
you would enter different values, and whoever is generating the document will be able to select one of the options, and that&#39;s all they can select.
In addition to it being a select field, you can also create a dependent field. So if you create one select field, and then you can create a second select field that is dependent on the first one, this allows you to have standardized values that are being applied based on the previous selection.
So for example, if you have, ah, contracts being generated, you can ask the administrator to say, is this the first year resident, second year resident, or third year resident by selecting the PGY-1, PGY-2, or PGY-3 in a drop-down, and then you could have a second dependent field where if you choose
PGY-1 in the first field, there, the second field is going to have a value of, ah, let&#39;s say, a $75,000 salary.
If you choose PGY-2, maybe it&#39;s $80,000. So the second field is not editable by this, by the end user. It&#39;s automatically applied based on the first field.
And then there&#39;s also at the bottom for each of these fields, text fields, field select field, uhm, you have an editable option.
So if you, so, turn this checkbox call on, which has allowed the value to be editable on, in creating documents.
If you enable that, when the administrator generates the contract or document, they&#39;ll be able to change the value. So we talked about text field, we talked about select field, we talked about a special type of select field called dependent field.
Now let&#39;s talk about a system field. A system field is one of the pre-set fields that allows an administrator to insert data from Metrics Database.
So you&#39;re setting up, selecting some data that&#39;s already in the system, and you&#39;re saying, if you, if this merge field is used in the letter, when the document is generated for a person, the value of this field for that person will be inserted into the letter.
So, for example, if I choose first name. Then, when the letter is generated, it&#39;s going to insert the first name from that person&#39;s profile into the letter.
There&#39;s also a way to make this editable, so they can edit this while they are, uhm, uh, generating the letter.
Next, we have a date field. Administrator select a field when they are generating the document. Image field allows them to administrate an insert image when generating the document.
And then, for this, you have, you can choose an image name. This is show, this drop down called select image name is showing a list of file types.
That have, that was created in the institutional portal under system setup, customize document types. So, what you&#39;re telling the metrics platform is, when this field is used, insert the image that is stored as part of this document category.
So, what happens is, when metrics creates a, a, uhm, when metrics creates a, a chart, it&#39;s going to take that chart and store it as a document in the document category.
This document, this document image, ah, type. And then, when the letter is generated, it&#39;s going to take that image from that document type for that student and insert it into the, into the document, uhm, and, and you see it on the screen.
So, let&#39;s choose, let&#39;s say, select, ah, for almost all of the MSPE fields, you&#39;re going to use system fields because most of these fields are going to be data that you imported and you want to put into the letter.
When you&#39;re generating, uhm, contracts and other things in Metrics, you may use some of these other fields. Text, image fields are used, uhm, for all of the charts that you&#39;re going to have in the letter.
Let me, let me choose a select field and save and continue. Call this, ah, select sample. And then, on the next page, you have a way to add values.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5cda517431ab44d1aff7f6050935bba9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Quarterly Check-in Analysis 📊</pre></td><td><pre>So.

Uhm, we should try. Otherwise, I don&#39;t have access to all the columns that you have. Sales calls, that, and that.
Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s do San Juan&#39;s quarterly check-in.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s on here. It&#39;s a transcript. I put this in here, but I&#39;m going to put the same instructions into the other one.

Do not write the post. Just give me ideas first. Okay, so let&#39;s try this one, uhm, write a post for idea number three.
Using the instructions in the GPT. So, let&#39;s see, medical education is moving forward.
Can you zoom in a bit? Uhm, I&#39;m going to pick a different one. I actually like the top one. It&#39;s, cause, that, that can be a non-product oriented one.
Yeah. Cause if we actually. Have it rated in a way that&#39;s not talking about metrics, metrics, metrics. Yeah. Should be a post that medical education leaders can learn from.
Use the instructions from GPT. Yeah, this is good, yeah uhm. So. I&#39;m gonna do one more thing. Make this more scannable with using line breaks and shorter sentences, short sentences, uhm.
Yeah, it also worked with, Scheduled sessions during like, January, so which is good. Alright, I don&#39;t really want to change anything, I think it looks fine.
Yeah, no, it&#39;s good. And then, let&#39;s see if, Atlanta. Try searching, uhm, uh, when we were in Kansas City.
I think there&#39;s a good picture of you, like, almost, like, over the shoulder on the computer. Uhm, let&#39;s see, so, so this is a good tool for generating vector images.
With ideas for, Yeah, this is also very, uh, asking it to create a visual metaphor. It&#39;s, it always gives you great ideas because visual metaphors people really like on LinkedIn.
Because it&#39;s one image that captures, like, the whole message. Yeah, the thing I&#39;ve noticed with it, with metaphors, is it does, especially with our niche, it does like using puzzles a lot.
Uh, which is a great one. I like, I like the visual. It&#39;s just we wouldn&#39;t want to be doing puzzles like that.
So let&#39;s try something else out. Give me some more, more visual metaphors that are not puzzles. Oh, I like that one.
So, a vector, ,that I saved. Copy, copy. Don&#39;t like that shit. What the f*** is this shit?
Well honestly, the, the description of it, If we, like, that would be a, a perfect thing to be able to put into the, the item on a If we were doing it that way.
Yeah, yeah. Put it into the process. Actually, you know what? It&#39;s 2.30. Okay. Hm, huh, hm, hm, hmm, hmm, Ffff You&#39;re perfect.
Yeah. Right. So, essentially, what this issue is, is, uhm, testing out through the net for single sign-on, enrollment, they want to activate people automatically.
Yeah. Uhm, ah. I&#39;m in the testing site for this, maybe in the SAMI test, which I actually don&#39;t know if it is.

Meaning like, uhm, uhm, anyone that is talking to a customer is going to be using Rocket Lane to manage the task.
And it&#39;s been working really well for Katie for the past few months, and, uh, it makes sense. We&#39;re going to be putting Optimizer in there, MSBE Projects, and then we created, the nice thing about Rocket Lane, it&#39;s built for this.
It&#39;s built for account management, for, uhm, uhm, B2B customers, so they, we don&#39;t have to, like, create fields and all that.
We can it for, uhm, our, our, our needs, so for example, go to Accounts, we have all of our customers in here, if I open up one of the accounts, it&#39;ll show me the details of it, uhm, I can go to Projects, what are the projects that we&#39;re doing with them, so if a customer is starting with, Thank you.
us, they&#39;re going to have an onboarding project, so let&#39;s say if I go to, uhm, San Juan, let&#39;s see, San Juan, or Mayaguez, for example, they&#39;re going to have their onboarding, they, we did two projects with them, uh, one for their main onboarding, I mean, main institution, and then we also did an onboarding
project with them. So, if I open this up, then I can see, what work was done for them, uhm, and for customer, once they finish onboarding, customer success is taking over for managing that relationship, uhm, there, we&#39;re gonna, we set up Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, so that any tasks that come in for that quarter
ends up in there, uhm, Mark&#39;s meeting with each of these clients every quarter, this allows him to also have visibility into what was done that quarter, or the previous quarter, uhm, for your, the only thing that you have to do in here is just keep an eye on, uh, any development tasks that gets assigned
to you, you don&#39;t really have to go in to anything else, uhm, so if you go into, uhm, your dash, even if you just go to the dashboard, it should list out any tasks that was assigned to you, uhm, or if you want to go to all tasks, it&#39;ll give you what&#39;s assigned to me, uhm.
We are doing sprints in here for the customer facing people, I don&#39;t think you need to be part of that sprint because you&#39;re, whatever is assigned to you is not going to be time sensitive, meaning they&#39;re all going to be feature requests, if it&#39;s a bug, Maria&#39;s writing it up.
So if something is assigned to you, you would just basically, uh, you just want to have it reminded on the calendar to, uh, once, once every couple of days, just go in here, if you need to take any new feature request that came in, uhm, add it to JIRA, and then link it here.
Okay. So, uh, Alright, so this is the source. Where the feature requests are going to come from. Yeah, because instead of, Exactly.
Instead of KD copying and pasting it into Slack and tagging you, because that is not really a good solution, it would be, uhm, let&#39;s say if I have, Is this also coming from, Mark and customer success.
Yeah, yeah. Because often something will just come out of the blue when he&#39;s having to check in. Yep, exactly. So he&#39;s going to have it all written in here and then assigned to you.
Okay. Uhm, so a talent customer success. So yesterday, for example, I think this was probably, assigned to you, no not that.
Are those all feature requests? Or, No, no. Some others, they have different things. And only whatever is assigned to you.
Okay, alright. So if I click on this, it should have enough detail here. Uhm, what we, the two things that we need to do here is, one, create a Jira issue, and you can do that directly from here, and it even pulls in the template.
So everything that you need to do is actually here. You don&#39;t even have to go into Jira. Okay. Uhm, yeah.
Unlike in front, where it doesn&#39;t pull in all the fields, this actually pulls in all the fields, so that you can, uhm, you can, uhm, actually I guess a template doesn&#39;t come in.
You can probably create a template in here if you, if you want to just live in here. Uhm, but. So I could just, if I want to, I could just open up Jira and just.
Yeah, you can just do it in Jira, and then you can say, link to Jira issue, and you just put the Jira URL in here.
Okay, okay. So then, basically, it just works just like front, where when a status changes, something is done in Jira, updates come into here.
Okay. And then the, the final, ah, part here. It would also be good to, uhm, there&#39;s always, if there&#39;s a feature request that came in from, ah, front, there would always be a front link in here.
Yeah. If there is one, it&#39;s good to also just link that to the front issue, the Jira ticket. Uhm, only because that way, when that task is done, it&#39;ll send an update to front and to, ah, rocket lane, but that&#39;s nice to have.
You&#39;re saying copy and paste that into Jira. So I, I, I, let&#39;s say if I make this Jira issue. Yeah.
And I&#39;m going to pay, I&#39;m going to, put that Jira URL in here. So that&#39;s like that way. And then here you also have that, uh, Jira.
Oh, so open up front. Yeah. I need to say add issue. Yeah. Add issue. And then, and let&#39;s see, not create new.

Portfolios is, it&#39;s its own thing. Because, at least the way that clients think about it.
So, sco- uh, research, publications, if you go to a conference and you present something, that typically goes under scholarly activity.
These are all, like, things that they are doing outside of their current, uhm, like, training. It&#39;s like extracurricular activities. And you build your resume or CV by doing these kinds of things.
Uh, portfolios, on the other hand, are typically things that they are doing as part of their training. So, LMU, for example, they require the students to complete certain tasks in their, uh, rotations.
They have to write up a patient note. They have to read an article and write a, uh, thing about it.
And all of those things that they put together during that training ends up being in their portfolio that shows that they learned a bunch of stuff.
So, it&#39;s not only exams that they&#39;re looking at to say this person is competent. They&#39;re looking at a bunch of things that they&#39;ve created.
Uhm, it&#39;s possible that some institutions think more broadly. So, it could be, like, in the case of LWU, it&#39;s very specific what they&#39;re looking for.
When we talk to Ross Vett, they see the portfolio as really the entire user profile that we have in the system that has their schedules, they have their case logs, the entire thing is in their portfolio.
Uhm, but scholarly activity is just, one piece of it. It&#39;s just basically, I did research, I published in a journal, I went to a conference, I presented something there, those things are scholarly activity.
But, I think, what I&#39;m trying to say is, no one is, like, if we&#39;re looking, if we&#39;re giving this to someone and they&#39;re browsing it for what they want to purchase from us.
Yeah. You can&#39;t buy scholarly activity. Scholarly activity without having portfolios. Can you remind me what&#39;s in portfolios versus scholarly activity?
Because I get those confused a lot. Portfolios, essentially, in system, is the user profile that shows all of that user&#39;s information.
Actually, uh, no. So, this instance, the reason I have it separately is I&#39;m thinking about it when we actually sell it with LMU, because LMU is using it under the evaluations module as the reviews functionality, where, so the way that LMU uses it is, students have a bunch of open evaluations, they submit
to their preceptor, preceptors review whatever they submitted, which could be a document, which could be a, ah, something they wrote, and they give them feedback, and it goes back to the preceptor, and then it goes, exchanges back and forth.
So, I&#39;m having here as a separate thing, because, mainly because portfolios is a big selling point, uhm, Almost like highest evaluations for some institutions, they are, go out looking for portfolios.
Uhm, so, if we have it in here, we, we can sell it as, like, if I&#39;m having a conversation with a place like Mitch, where they&#39;re coming from eValue, and they&#39;ve been doing the portfolios in there, and they&#39;re trying to, ah, have it.
A way to go back and forth with the students and the educators to provide feedback on something they created, we, we can do that under the evaluations, but if they&#39;re, if they&#39;re, we&#39;re looking at someone like, ah, Ross Vette, where they&#39;re looking at the user overview, then we can say that&#39;s part of
the educator profiles you have at SVette. This is, that&#39;s the same thing that Kai commented the other day we had the meeting, and say here&#39;s the portfolio of everything.
So it all depends on how they define it, but the, what we can actually sell is the, the reviews component that we made for LMU.
Uhm, it&#39;s a gray area because it&#39;s, it, people depend on but it is a big enough item that I don&#39;t want to put it as a subcategory because people go out looking for portfolios.
Uhm, and this is the type of thing that I would first want to understand what they&#39;re looking for before I show them the solution.
If they&#39;re looking for a way to provide feedback to the students and curate a bunch of documents together that during their retirement I would sell them evaluations and how they can do it in the reviews.
If they&#39;re looking for the user overview, then I say, our system is already putting together this, using the user overview page and it gives you the advices and everybody can look at all of their things in one place.
So user overviews are for portfolios? I would that way. I would actually put it as, uhm, uhm, learner and educator demographics.
So it&#39;s separate from portfolios? Yeah, uhm, yeah, this, like, I&#39;m not giving you a good answer for this because it is a gray area.
But again, I&#39;m, I just, again, to clarify, I&#39;m getting a little confused. I&#39;m saying scholarly activity as a subcategory of portfolios because from my understanding, what you&#39;re describing is, we can sell portfolios without selling scholarly activities.
But we can&#39;t really sell scholarly activity without selling portfolios. No, scholarly activity is its own module that we have, uhm, like, on the left menu.
Like, if you&#39;re in the personal portal, you have scholarly activity where you can log all of these. Uh, and the reason why we want it as a main item is this is actually a requirement by ACGME that every category in here is something that ACGME collects data on.
So for residents and faculty members, every single category for six months, they have to submit the scholarly activities that the residents and students did.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f540565842744de1809d64be80d572e0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Exploring AI-generated Ideas for Software Recruitment</pre></td><td><pre>So, I wanted to share this, ah, example.

It&#39;s more about recruiting for a software company. So I, I feel like any transcript that we have. There is a potential for posts to come out of that.
It&#39;s going to be how we, how we, uh, prompt it to, uh, spin it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/68bff5cd6a224503b38d0ab1cd4f7d59</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Visual Proposal Design 🎨</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Afnan. I wanted to ask you if you can help with a project that we&#39;ve been struggling with. And this is not a LinkedIn carousel.
This is meant to be a document or a Canva link that we share with a potential, a potential client that&#39;s interested in our product so that they have a resource that they can use to promote our product to other people in their organization.
Uhm, so it&#39;s supposed to be a visually engaging, virtual, uhm, brochure, This, for the, uhm, the cover slide, I mocked something up in, uh, not the cover slide, sorry, the, uh, Let me see, this is, something that we mocked up initially, but the idea is we have a cover slide and then we have an about
us page. And for this, I actually, mocked this up here. The team had made this, but I wasn&#39;t very happy with it.
So, I put this in here, and I made a video explaining what I envisioned here. And, uh, this is a separate video that I&#39;ll send with this.
And then after the cover slide, we are supposed to have a menu like this, uhm, where we show different items.
And, like, the different modules, but I, I was not a big fan of the way that was going. Was laid out.
I think having a page where we have different modules, some of the other services that we offer, uhm, maybe a better fit.
And I&#39;m going to also show you one more proposal. Let me see if I can find one. So here&#39;s an example of a proposal where we have this.
So what we&#39;re trying to do is basically create a new version of the proposal, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s sort of like a visually engaging proposal, but it actually goes before they get to the proposal stage.
After we have the initial meeting with them, we send this so they can use this to promote. So it has more details on our company.
So the idea is you go to this first page, you know, the intro, second page, you learn about the company, third page, we learn about our products and services, and then you can use these links, uh, to go to different pages.
So if you&#39;re interested in one of these modules, then you can go to that page. And then on that page, uh, this is a newer concept.
We have a brief summary about that page, and then screenshot, screenshot, and then a little, uh, link here, a button here that allows them to click on a link.
It opens up a new window and it can, they can view a video. Uhm, and then from any of these pages, you go, you can go back to the menu and go to other sections.
Let&#39;s see if I can find Here is a Slides example of this so you can see different modules and then we can send that over to them and they can They could take this and so we&#39;re still working on the screenshots and the copy It would be great if we can make this design in Canva and then put use filler,
filler text, uh, lorem ipsum so that and the screenshots can also be placeholders, uhm, and then we can go in there and fill in the information.
Uhm, any, we&#39;re open to other, any other ideas that you have. Uhm, and I would love to, uh, have this design, hold on a second, love to, uh, have this, uh, design in a similar style that you have for this document.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a88037abaec2480b8c77085fa770f493</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Competencies in Metrics 📊</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m going to go over how competencies work in metrics, and how we can turn the uh turn the document that she sent us into an importable format.
So in metrics, if you go to one of the training programs that has competencies, you can see them by going to the system setup and competencies under that program.
So here&#39;s the format. You have the core competency. Sub competency, and within each sub competency, we have levels. Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and then there&#39;s parts within those levels.
These are the uhm the standard, and if you look at what she sent over, she has this document. Thank you.
Thank you. And inside of these levels, sometimes you can have more than one part. Part 1, part 2, part 3.
And this mirrors what ACGME has created for each of the specialties. If I open up the screen, we have this format for these documents where I have core competency, system-based practice is the core competency.
Patient safety and quality improvement is the first sub-competency. Then you have level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4. And then part 1, part 1, part 2, part 3 of that particular level.
Same exact format here. So to convert this into metrics, we have this template that we have to use to import it.
So I&#39;ve labeled this PC for patient care, sub-competency, uh PC1. And that is the sub-competency description. And you can see here, for this particular sub-competency, we have three parts.
And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s because on her document, she had one, two, three here. And it looks like here, we also have additional ones.
So what I did to create this is, I went into this document, and selected this first part. First column, and then I can go here, paste this here, but it doesn&#39;t always paste perfectly.
And move this up, move this up, and then this is one, two, three, and then here it&#39;s, I&#39;m actually, I&#39;m holding down the shift button when I paste so that it doesn&#39;t paste the formatting.
so shift command V and that stands for biomedical and social science knowledge and for this I would go in here take this I have to look through this, so this one here has three so for me to get that working to the last one, okay.
So, here, here, here. I&#39;m always holding that shift button when I paste. And uh yeah, we gotta finish that for level one, I mean uhm level one, level two, and level three.
So, for example, back up here, patient care, I&#39;m gonna go back up to the top. I would take this column.
The nice thing is she has dashes for when there&#39;s more than one so it&#39;s easier to identify. You can add dashes.
So make sure there&#39;s no addition, other ones that are missing dashes. Back here, so this is now level three. The second level, so I gotta go, I gotta skip these, and go to level two, paste it here, no dash, so it&#39;s a new one, this has a dash, so it&#39;s here, and level, this has a dash, so it goes there
, which means it&#39;s part one, part two, and then part three, I&#39;m gonna double check something, one, two, so you contribute is part of the next one so this is here, here, okay so you can see that I&#39;ve added it to level two part um one and two because we have this is a second level most of them only have
one part some of them have part one and part two and part three something demonstrate and apply 1, 2. Sorry, it&#39;s uh Looking at the wrong column.
So 1, 2. So yeah, 2, 2, 1 2 parts. So going back here, we got 2, 2, 1, 2 parts.
And then we repeat that for level 3 So, if you can help with this, once it&#39;s all formatted, we want to download this as a CSV and go into the uhm the server.
And I recommend doing it on the staging server, so you can do uhco.metrics.sg. And on the staging server, we can try it out, make sure everything works, and confirm it before doing it on the production.
So, on the staging server, I would log in using the same password as production. And you want to change the URL to company.
Then go to programs, edit, and there&#39;s a button here to upload the milestones for that particular training program. Once it&#39;s uploaded, if it gives a success message, you can go to competency, confirm that it&#39;s in there.
Once it&#39;s confirmed, we can repeat the same thing on production, which is going to be metriclab.com, subcompany, and the same exact thing.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eb018674422943af9226c7b273bfaec5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Competency Document Conversion Tutorial</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Shruti, wanted to create this video to show you how to convert a competency document like this to an importable format in Metrix.
And this is something that we often have to do. for new clients, because they may be using different types of competencies.
And usually we give instructions to a virtual assistant, sometimes Lei, to create this, as we have time for them to do this.
But today, I wanted to share this with you and see if you can help do this, so that we can get it imported.
I&#39;m going to get this started with the first one, and this is what the end result looks like. You have core competencies, sub competencies, and then in C, inside of this, we have level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, and you have uhm part 1 of level 1, part 2 of level 2, and so on.
So if we look at what she has created, she has the core competency, the core competency description, the sub competency, and then this is also the code for the sub competency, and these are the levels.
So level 1, level 2, level 3, and then within level 1, you know, we only have one part, so we would add this as level 1, part 1, level 2, part 1, level 3, part 1.
So I&#39;ve been working thinking about how we can make this easier, so what I&#39;m leaning towards is taking this first column and giving it to chat-gpt write this with one objective per line.
Okay, do not number them. I&#39;m not sure if the bullets made a difference, but let me try. So take this and put it in here.
into a template. So this is the format, and there&#39;s some in here. Seven of them, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Nice, it worked. And then for, um, this here, we can take it and do the same thing. So level one, part one.
Let&#39;s see if I can just paste it. No, it doesn&#39;t work. Just want to make sure that. Just want to make sure that the number that it gets is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
So here it may be messing something up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, I think you may have screwed something up.
This probably should be separate. Oh, her numbering is off. It says 1.6, 1.7. Okay, so for here, uhm, I think it made each of these separate.
So this is level 1, part 1. Part 2, part 3. So for that, able, demonstrate, demonstrate. There&#39;s three of them.
Take this. Place this here. This is going to go. You see 4. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So the 4th one has part 2, part 3, part 4.
I&#39;m just going to move this up. I should be able to screw that up. Okay, so we&#39;ve got that. And I&#39;ll upload this to uhm Google Sheets.
This is PC. Okay, so essentially what we want to do is take these, put them into this document. If they have more than one milestone, we&#39;re going within that level, we can break that up into level 1, level 2, level 3, um and update the rest of these.
once you&#39;re in the system. u h c o we can go to the company portal and then go to programs optometry program edit and then there is an upload csv option here we can use this to upload it my recommendation is instead of doing it directly on the production go to go to the staging server dot SG and log
in there upload it make sure that you&#39;re not getting an error and go to system setup and rotate I mean at competencies make sure it&#39;s showing up there and then once you&#39;re confirmed it&#39;s working do it in production this way we don&#39;t have to clean up any data on production if something goes wrong so what
um more um yeah it&#39;s not as it says 56 pages but it&#39;s not all that it&#39;s only up to here rest of it is just listing out some other set of competencies</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4965a8c05c644f728c93f22ab9c267df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum Planning Discussion 📚</pre></td><td><pre>so for this thing here back to that so for these miles uh I think instead of us trying to extract from here We&#39;ll see you Because I don&#39;t know if AI is doing a good job with this Because I felt like it&#39;s Loading a lot of Objectives.
And I think it may be breaking up. There are just a lot of objectives. Like ah, for example Yeah, it&#39;s just.
There are just a lot of objectives. So, see, these are not really objectives. These are keywords. Yep. So, I think we should, instead of importing these as, uh, the problem with this is going to be.
We don&#39;t have a way to tag courses as, with keywords. You can only tag courses with, uh, with, uh, objectives.
Only sessions can be tagged with, uh, keywords. So we kind of have to keep them then, if they want this whole list to tag to the course.
Yeah, um. I&#39;m wondering maybe we should, we, we just take these and and use these as course objectives, and then for these we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll keep them as program level objectives, because then we can map this to these two.
That&#39;s not going to work either. It&#39;s, it&#39;s not a good. We just ended, what we ended up doing, was we just put like 511.1 as the course objective.
We just tied everything to that. So let me go. Okay, um. The problem is. The reason I&#39;m trying to like change this is because it takes so long to load, which.
I don&#39;t want them to see it as like a flaw in the system. Anyway, that is less important. Because we can fix that after.
So for schedules, uhm, the way that they are structured is on this plan it shows. Residence schedule, uhm, current process, curriculum, preclinical, clinical schedules, academic period, so we can confirm that&#39;s the academic period, academic period is set up on the institutional portal under system setup
, academic periods, July 1st, yeah so that&#39;s correct, and so second year all goes to family, have family practice, third year they do various rotations, and each faculty, each faculty has four students, each one has four students, so we were going to do this as shift schedules, because block schedules
you have to go for a multiple days at a time, if you want to do daily schedules it has to be done on the shift schedules, and then for fourth year, it&#39;s all on the block schedules, so let me see if she sent over a sample, nope.
That&#39;s cheating. I also gotta stop letting them do these like printed off and then scanned in pdfs. Because ChatGPT can&#39;t read that.
So like I had to do it all manually because ChatGPT could not read those files. Oh really? It can&#39;t, it can&#39;t process that.
So we gotta not. Yeah. So, yeah. I think if she has any more we gotta tell her, tell her to send us the original.
Because she obviously saved it from the system. Yeah, I don&#39;t know why they then, like, why it was then scanned in.
Okay, so we don&#39;t have the schedules, basically, is the answer right now. So, yeah, what we can do is, uhm, ask Katie.
to send them an email. We want to get the list of, uhm, a list of rotations or, uhm, externship. So, I&#39;ll write that here.
Sample schedule for 3rd year student, 4th year student. All the students we made in there are 2nd year. Does she ask for 100 2nd years?
2nd, okay. So do you want me to load some more sample students for 3rd and 4th years? I&#39;m a little confused.
Like I get that she didn&#39;t want 1st year because they don&#39;t do both types of course or whatever. But I don&#39;t get why she wanted 2nd year.
That&#39;s why I asked in the meeting too. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think she meant. Let me see if uh.
Look at this. I don&#39;t think she meant 2nd year. I think she meant like 2nd phase or something. Because like.
The 1st phase is the classroom based training. And the 2nd phase is That may be what she meant. But she didn&#39;t communicate that.
Uhm. I want to see exact. No she said 2nd year. I triple checked it when I made them. That&#39;s why I asked her in the meeting yesterday.
So let&#39;s go back to this here. Oh here. She does. So 2nd year all go to family practice. And they also have.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9a93abb630e342b79cb5f18ed605cae9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updates and Achievements Overview</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning everyone. I wanted to take a few minutes to share updates from Q1 and Q2. This attached PDF will show you more details.
But in this video, I want to thank you for your continued support. Thank you for our entire team for all of the work that you did in the first two quarters to help us accomplish these things.
And share a few items from this document. One is we are continuing to attract more university clients. Essentially, our biggest growth has been in the medical school and the vet school market.
And we&#39;re targeting our marketing efforts in that area too. We&#39;re doing less marketing in the hospital world for GME because we&#39;re realizing that it&#39;s a lot more work to onboard them and the contracts are not as large.
So by increasing the the revenue using our university prospects, we can later on come back and do a better job with the GME.
So stay focused on the UME and the and the university with a plan to do more in the GME later on.
We also had expansion of some of our contracts. So these are medical schools or hospitals that have expanded and added new modules or new trainees to the system.
For revenue, um there there are multiple new clients that have added. and the quarterly revenue is because we don&#39;t always have contracts spread out evenly throughout the year.
Larger renewals often happen in July when the academic year starts or at the end of the year. So that&#39;s why there&#39;s some fluctuations.
We&#39;ve added some new team members. Some of our expenses have gone up. We&#39;re also pairing that with the increased revenue.
These days, we&#39;re also generating leads through our website more, organic leads, so that we don&#39;t always have to wait for conferences to generate them.
With the new podcast and LinkedIn marketing, more people are coming to our website and requesting a consultation. And one of the things that we&#39;re doing is adding a status of advocate, stable or at risk for each of our clients.
And we&#39;re doing a campaign to talk to these customers and make sure that we&#39;re moving more and more clients to the advocate status.
By the end of the year, we&#39;re hoping to have three-fourths of our clients as advocate. When it comes to our product development, a big release this quarter was our client engagement panel.
This allows our customers to see statuses of different engagement in their system. For example, how many users are logging in.
How many, how many evaluations are getting assigned. So this is a dashboard that the institutional administrators can use. But more importantly, it also triggers alerts for our customer success team to monitor engagement across different clients.
We also have our mobile app that&#39;s almost done and it&#39;s getting ready to be released. And finally, we there&#39;s a growth in the number of AI projects that we&#39;re working on.
Rio has taken the lead on AI development and he&#39;s added two AI features to the system. One for curriculum mapping, another one for scheduling.
And a big AI-related topic is our acquisition of ChatWebby. So this is a platform that was developed by another team and I met the founder online and he was trying to get rid of this platform because it was He had another project that he was focusing on and he didn&#39;t see a lot of growth opportunities
in the consumer market. But in the hospital and education market where they don&#39;t have access to these kind of tools that consumers do, we are able to provide a secure platform.
That allows hospitals and universities to create chatbots using their content and share with their users. So this, once we have acquired the platform, the same team is adding some administrative capabilities.
And we also already have two or three different clients that are interested in piloting it. So this is an ex, uh, an example.
A relatively simple tool that will provide value and also allow us to get our foot in the door at institutions.
I&#39;m looking forward to sharing more updates on this in the future. A big milestone for 2024 is the launch of our podcast.
And the podcast has continued to increase the number of regular audience members. We&#39;re having medical education leaders join and participate in the discussion.
And each time we share content, we&#39;re also aligning our brand with medical education leadership so that it&#39;s uh uh we&#39;re coming off as not just a software company but experts in the industry.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/03bad31bd8a046e9813137c58e22e64b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Company Metrics Update</pre></td><td><pre>everyone wanted to share a brief update from metrics that covers q1 and q2 the attached uh pdf goes into more detail but in this video i&#39;ll highlight some of the important things that we wanted to share i&#39;m also very grateful for your continued support and i&#39;m also extremely grateful for all of our team
members who&#39;s been working very hard over the past few months to accomplish some of the things that we&#39;re highlighting today you know for our sales side we&#39;ve been focusing more on the university market because that&#39;s where we&#39;re getting the most interest and we also seeing a more standardized onboarding
process with university. clients so that&#39;s where most of our marketing effort is going we&#39;re getting more interest in the medical school as well as the the veterinary school prospects so vet schools and medical schools we&#39;re also this quarter had a pharmacy program for the first time select metrics as
their residency management platform we did this as an experiment to see how metrics can be used in pharmacy schools and it was a very streamlined process and they are really enjoying the usability of the platform and we&#39;re deciding if this is something that we want to accept in the future.
The only challenge with the pharmacy programs is their budgets are usually smaller so we want to only take on more pharmacy schools if we can onboard them with more self-driven training content.
In terms of expansion, we&#39;ve seen several clients expand their contracts this year, including University of Pikeville Medical School that has added several modules and students to the platform.
We also expanded the San Juan Bautista School of Medicine contract to include the clinical education. They were only using metrics for UME in the past for the curriculum.
Now they&#39;re also using it for clinicals. When it comes to revenue, we are continuing to expand our ARR. For quarterly revenue, we usually have fluctuations because our contracts don&#39;t always stay.
We have larger contracts starting in July because of the start of the academic year. Then we also have some staggered to the second half of the year.
That&#39;s why there&#39;s usually a variation between the revenue and the quarters. And for our expenses, we&#39;ve been increasing some of this because we&#39;ve added additional team members, but all of this is, is it, uh, aligned with the growth in the revenue for sales.
We are now generating more organic leads. Yeah. In the past, we had to go to conferences to generate leads. Now we, with our new marketing effort and content creation, especially on LinkedIn, we&#39;re starting to get leads come to our website and request demos.
These are some of our prospects that are, that are in the pipeline that&#39;s approaching the, the, uh, the contract phase.
For retention, there is an increase in the, uh, um, number of clients that are doing quarterly check-ins with us. So, last, uh, last, uh, quarter, we started tracking all of, actually, uh, uh, last year, we started tracking all of our clients with the status of advocate-stable or at-risk.
And we realized that there are several clients from the beginning of Metrix that have used the platform but don&#39;t always talk to us, but we wanted to start establishing a line of communication with them every quarter, make sure that we&#39;re doing well.
This has been an ongoing process, and since Q1 and Q2, we have added more prospects to this quarterly check-in. So in Q1, we had four.
In Q2, we had four. And now, we&#39;re also working on moving more of these clients from stable or at-risk into the advocate status.
And if you notice here, we have a few that are categorized as at-risk. Some of these are because they haven&#39;t been speaking to us for a while due to their current their established use of the platform.
They don&#39;t know, they don&#39;t need any additional help but we&#39;re still trying to get a regular check-in going with them.
Once we establish contact, we are moving them into a stable or advocate. An advocate is someone that will speak on our behalf to another client as a reference will promote metrics um to other medical education leaders.
We did have a slightly higher churn rate this year. All of these are smaller contracts that are 10k or under and this is something that we have um uh the main reason that we face these challenges with the churn is because we are supporting larger organizations with a smaller team These smaller organizations
did not get the attention that they needed and part and part of the</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/83327fbb868f4e59908187a23264922f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Investor Update and Growth Strategies</pre></td><td><pre>Hello everyone, I hope all of you are doing well. I wanted to take a few minutes to run through this investor update and summarize some of the things that are in there.
From a growth perspective, we&#39;ve continued to focus on the university market and have been adding medical schools vet schools and doing some experimental work with some pharmacy program, this pharmacy program.
So most of our clients are in the physician market or the veterinary market, but we had a new pharmacy program that has reached out to us and we have onboarded them and it&#39;s been a very successful experience.
we&#39;ve scaled back on the marketing and sales we&#39;re doing to the hospital market because we realized that they require more support and onboarding and given the limited resources we have, we figured we can continue to expand our revenue using the university experience.
So, as you see, most of these are going to be universities that we have expanded to and even in our existing contracts, we&#39;re seeing that expansion from university clients that have already been using the platform, now they&#39;re adding more students or more modules to their contract.
And each of these contracts are also planned for expansion. Clemson University, for example, is a brand new vet school and they are signing on for the first time.
year of students. And then as each new class comes on, this contract will expand. Lincoln Memorial University signed on for one module in metrics and they&#39;re planning on expanding to additional modules in the next year or two.
This page summarizes our revenue as well as expenses. One thing I want to highlight here is we are selling metrics on an annual subscription model and certain months will have more renewals than others.
That&#39;s part of the reason why our quarterly revenue can fluctuate because because of the renewal time frame. I want to highlight here we are now generating more organic leads.
In the past, we relied exclusively on conferences to generate leads. But now with our new content marketing strategy, we&#39;re getting more people to follow us on LinkedIn, seeing our content, going to our website, and then requesting a consultation.
So this is a great great outcome from our marketing team. And this is also allowing us to decrease our cost of acquisition because when it comes to conferences, they can be very expensive and there are only a few of those conferences annually.
With our content marketing, we can put this out there as a podcast or articles. And we&#39;re going to continuously generate leads from it over time.
These are some of our contracts that we are currently working towards and they&#39;re in the final stages of negotiation. Client retention and relationships.
This year we have really focused our efforts on on improving our customer success processes. One of the things that we have done is started tracking each client and their health.
We have a status that we apply to each client as advocate if they are a client that is willing to be a reference for us and we know that they are very engaged in the platform.
Stable if they are happy but may not be in the best, may may make it may need some work to get to that advocate status.
And the at risk means that we are at risk of using, losing that contract or we don&#39;t know the situation.
We don&#39;t status of that client. There are some older clients that have been using Metrish for many years that don&#39;t need any help and often don&#39;t talk to us.
We&#39;ve been putting an effort into reaching out to them and getting them on a quarterly check-in so that we can know for sure that they are happy and we are meeting their needs.
We also have had some of our smaller clients, four of them, cancelled their contract this year. And the first one here was due to an acquisition by another hospital and they were now asked to use their existing platform.
Second one is a vet tech program that we tried implementing Metrix with. We never got any vet tech program and what happened is they don&#39;t have the budget to maintain Metrix.
And for us, it didn&#39;t make sense to lower the cost significantly to support them because it would take away from us having to support some of our larger clients.
AltaMed is one of our hospital clients that has left us. And one of the reasons was they really wanted a mobile app and we did not provide that.
This is something that we are addressing and many of our clients want to have a downloadable mobile app for their residents.
We are in the final stages of releasing mobile app for iOS and Android.

For uhm, for the past few months I&#39;ve been working with a advisor, Scott.
Uh, Scott Chisholm is a, a uhm, former CEO who has built a company called Classy, which was acquired by, uh, Chisholm.
GoFundMe for, uh, for a billion dollars. And since he has, he has, uh, exited that, he started a new program called Highland, where he&#39;s working with companies and CEOs that are in the process of scaling, that has found product market fit and is scaling their operations.
So. Every, every week he&#39;s been having meetings with, uh, uh, different CEOs of these companies and helping implement a operating system that helps the company become more and more, um, efficient and, and being able to support the growth of the business as well as the team.
So this has been super helpful. for our team and for me to implement a better system that, that allows the team to stay focused on the, uh, our annual goals, our, our, uh, long-term vision and to support the growth of this, this new operating system and implementing it efficiently.
I&#39;ve also onboarded, uh, Shruti, who is our new chief executive. Chief of staff, and she&#39;s helping me implement the operating system, setting goals and keeping everybody aligned and, um, also helping, um, uh, manage some of the operations of the business.
In addition to Shruti, we&#39;ve also onboarded, uh, Augustin, who&#39;s coming on as a senior technical lead. And we&#39;ll hear they&#39;ll be helping with, uh, standardize some of the processes for our development team.
And Silvana, she is, uh, now taking over for our sales communication. She&#39;s managing our CRM and, and, uh, setting up all of the demos and meetings, which has been very helpful for me as, as I participate in some of these demos.
It allows us to generate more meetings and make sure that we are moving those, those, uh, prospect through the pipeline faster.
So each of these, uh, team members have already been fully onboarded and has, has been helping our team, uh, grow.
And, uh, I&#39;m excited to be to have them on the team. And I want to thank you all for your continued support and, uh, we will, uh, keep you updated and as the, uh, uh, things progress and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0a4e811cec4d4d29a022e502f85c96a2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updates and Expansion in Q1 and Q2</pre></td><td><pre>Hello everyone, I hope all of you are doing well. This is Santosh Charian, CEO and founder of Metrix. I wanted to take a few minutes to share some updates from Q1 and Q2.
When it comes to the company growth, we continue to focus on the university market, specifically the medical school and veterinary clients.
This is where we&#39;re seeing the most growth, but we&#39;re also accepting clients that are coming from allied health and nursing.
But our focus has been on the university market because it&#39;s allowing us to do larger deployments and have more expansion.
opportunities. So for example, this quarter we signed Clemson University that is starting a brand new veterinary medicine program. They&#39;ve signed on metrics to use for the first year of their class and they plan to expand into all four years as their as their class size increases.
So you can see this contract will continue to increase over the next four years. We are also signed on with Lincoln Memorial University and their College of Osteopathic Medicine.
This first initial contract is for our MSPE module, which is one module that we have and then we plan to expand that.
into the full platform over the next year or two. So that&#39;s going to uhm essentially increase this into uhm about 100k, 150k to 200k contract over the next two years.
So this approach of signing on institutions for a small part of the system and then expanding to additional students and additional modules has been an effective strategy in the university market.
We&#39;ve paused on our marketing efforts to the hospital clients. Essentially because we realized that the hospital world is requiring more support and onboarding time from us.
And it is something that we want to return and focus more on in the future. But we want to essentially stabilize the finances and hire additional team members with the opportunities that we&#39;re getting from the university market.
We&#39;ve also seen some expansions in our customers. So University of Pikeville added additional modules and students. We&#39;ve had San Juan Bautista School of Medicine added additional modules.
And even one of our earliest clients, Mayaguez, added another training program. And then when it comes to revenue, you know, we are an annual subscription model, which means that quarter to quarter there is variation in what&#39;s coming in because some of our clients are, most of our, a lot of our clients
change their software at the beginning of the academic year, which is in July. So this negative 20 percent, it&#39;s only because of the, you know, in Q2 is not when a lot of our renewals happen.
And we have a summary of our expenses and some of our loan repayments here. One of the things that you may have noticed if you&#39;re following us on LinkedIn is we&#39;re doing a lot more content marketing.
We have a brand new podcast that we launched and it&#39;s getting more momentum in the market. Essentially, we&#39;ve been publishing new podcast episodes and content every two weeks.
Recently, we also added articles and if you look at our homepage on metricslab.com, there&#39;s a whole new blog that has been getting consistent content.
And this is increasing the number of leads that we&#39;re generating on an organic basis. In the past, we had to go to these conferences to generate these leads.
Now we&#39;re starting to get more leads coming to us through our social media and website. These are some of the the contracts that we&#39;re working on.
We&#39;re working on closing in the near future. These are proposals that are approaching the contract stage. Another big focus of the team has been to increase our our customer success efforts.
Specifically, we are trying to move more of our clients into the advocate status, so for each of our clients, we&#39;re tracking them as whether they&#39;re an advocate, whether they&#39;re stable or at risk, and we review this on a monthly basis, and we are meeting with different clients and getting them started
on a quarterly check-in, and this allows us to make sure that we are prioritizing our prioritizing their needs and have addressed any risk factors early.
That being said, we did have these four institutions that we have lost in the last two quarters, and all of these are smaller contracts, and I&#39;ll explain each of them.
Thank you. So TCCADA was absorbed by another institution, and they, uh, the other institution has another platform in place. It&#39;s a much larger organization, and they were, um, they had to be integrated into that software.
LMU&#39;s VETTECH program, this is a, an experimental program. that we, uh, tried using Metrix for. The problem was, you know, it&#39;s a VETTECH program, it&#39;s not the Doctorate program, and they, uh, did not have the budget to maintain Metrix afterwards, and we could&#39;ve probably came down lower on the, on the
rate, but then at that time, there&#39;s a higher opportunity cost for us maintaining Metrix. Metrix for other institutions, um, and we&#39;re, we&#39;re not planning on adding any additional VETTECH programs, uh, until we have a way to support them without a lot of, uh, hands-on support.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b6e30e6d2ec4457ab973df7f5a02e1ee</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updates on Q1 and Q2 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Hello everyone, I hope you&#39;re doing well. Wanted to create this video to share some updates from Q1 and You&#39;ll have a copy of this in your inbox, but I&#39;ll talk through a few of the things that are important from this quarter.
When it comes to continued growth, we&#39;ve been adding additional institutions to Metrix and our our marketing and sales efforts have been focused on the university side.
And essentially, we&#39;ve been realizing that more and more institutions, especially medical schools, allied health centers, and health schools, Hello everyone, wanted to take a few moments to go over this investor update with you and share some key highlights from ah Q1 and Q2.
When it comes to the growth of Metrix, we&#39;re continuing to add additional institutions to the platform. Here are some of our newer clients.
Clemson University is a, a brand new ah, ah university. Clemson University.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/764963a8a4f54207a8bfd6cea6b1727f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setting Up Final Grade Report Process 👩‍🏫</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Robin, this ah set up for the final grade report seems to be a little bit more complicated than I initially thought and ah you know our goal is to assign a final grade report to every student for every core rotation.
To set that up, it must be assigned to a specific university To set that up, we&#39;re going to go into the system and create a new role for you.
We&#39;ll call this the final grade administrator. This role will only be used for the individual that&#39;s going to be submitting this form.
And we&#39;re using a separate role for this. So that we can target that individual in the system, um, so that the automation rules can pick up that individual instead of using a core faculty or some other roles that is shared.
Once the role is set up, you can go in there and create a new user. This user is going to have that, um, it&#39;s going to be for that administrator that&#39;s responsible for submitting all these forms.
And then let&#39;s review that in the system. We would do that on the user&#39;s page and on this page we would go into edit demographics and make sure that role is set up for final grade administrator.
Then we can go into evaluations and templates. Actually one more step here. So we want to go into schedules and rotations.
Here are all the all of the 39 rotations we have in the system. For any rotation that requires one of these final grade reports, you want to go in there and click edit.
And designate that new user as the administrator. And then enable this checkbox that says view evaluations. For individuals scheduled to this rotation.
So we have the user created, we have the role set up, we have that individual set up as an administrator for this rotation.
Then we go into the templates. And we choose final grade report. You&#39;ll see on the first page, it shows review period.
And then we prior performance. This is giving the system, or telling the system that when a form, when this form is opened by an evaluator, correction, when this form is opened by an evaluator, show all of the prior submissions at the top.
So imagine you have a internal medicine rotation, you have John Smith assigned to that rotation, or as a third year medical student.
There are five forms getting assigned, when one of those forms is this final grade report, when that administrator opens that form, he or she would see the submissions of the other four forms at the top, so they can review the performance and submit it.
So that&#39;s why we have this checkbox enabled. Then we have the questions on the next page, we&#39;ll skip over that.
Finally, these are the automation rules. So here, we want to choose the people in the rotation, what&#39;s being evaluated, what rotations do we want to include, and here we can set up all of the different rotations, and so far we only have two selected, we want to select all of them, if we want to use this
to collect grades for every rotation, who will complete this form, this is where we would choose individuals on the block schedule with the following roles, and we&#39;re going to choose the role of final grade administrator, who will be evaluated, we&#39;re going to choose MD3, and then yes, it&#39;s going to be
automatically assigned, and we&#39;ll put in a rule that says how many days from the end of the rotation should we want this to be uhm assigned.
So now we have the form set up, and all the automation rules set up. The final thing we have to do is tell the system that this individual is scheduled to cover all of these rotations.
And for that, we can, you know, we could go in here and assign them to all of these rotations, but that&#39;ll take forever.
Instead, what we can do is create a new block schedule, and we&#39;ll give that the administrator schedule as a name.
And then when we create this form for the roles, we&#39;re only going to select Salaam as the final grade administrator role, and then come down, and we&#39;re not going to automatically create a uhm autocreate, we&#39;re going to skip this autogenerate blocks, and simply go into to manage blocks for that new schedule
and create a block from. home the first day of the academic period till the last day of the academic period.
Essentially it&#39;s one big block covering the entire year. Then we can open that up, again I&#39;m not creating here, I&#39;m simply describing it, what we can do is open this up and then assign this administrator or the final grade administrator to every rotation we have in the system.
So it&#39;s as if this person is scheduled to that rotation for the entire year. Uhm and they&#39;ll have one assignment for every single rotation that is available in the system.
And what happens is, as the students are assigned to these rotations, uhm, one month at a time or four weeks at a time, the system will notice that this individual is also responsible for completing the final grade and match up that evaluation for that particular rotation assignment and assign it to</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/959cf034749146e38b7c58373de0dd53</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Curriculum Setup Guide 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Curriculum module Set up First thing Configure the basic information about Your curriculum Including the institution name And define the academic levels Then set the event types And uh define the color set the event types and define the color codes And customize instructional methods Then review

So this is a little tricky to set up, but once it&#39;s set up, it should automatically assign for every rotation.
So the first thing that we want to do is go to the user&#39;s page and create a user. A user account for that individual who&#39;s going to be submitting all these forms.
And when we create that user, we want to have a unique role for that individual. And no one else in the system should have that role because we want to target evaluations using that specific role.
Maybe we call it the final grade administrator. And I think this is something that we haven&#39;t created yet. So once you think of a role, we can let us know and we can create that for you.
Then we create this account. And the second thing we want to do is go to schedules, rotations. For every rotation that we want to submit a role.
In a final grade report, we want to designate this individual as uhm. As the administrator, so we would go in here, click edit.
And under rotation directors and administrator, select a person and choose view evaluations for individuals scheduled to this rotation. We want to make sure that we turn this checkbox on so that they have permission to view all the other submissions.
So imagine you have a student going to internal medicine. They have five forms that are assigned to them and the final grade administrator is going to get the last one which is the final grade report.
When they open up that form, at the top of that form they&#39;ll see a section that says prior evaluations and they&#39;ll be able to open up all the other four forms that were submitted, review their performance and submit that form.
final grade report. So we have set up the user, we have added them, added that individual as administrators to all of these rotations.
Now we can go to the form and on this form we have enabled this checkbox that says review prior performance.
That&#39;s Bye. This is going to be the one form that has this checkbox enabled because it&#39;s a summative form that allows the final grade administrator to see the submissions from the other forms.
Then we have the questions on here and finally when we get to the last page which is the assignment rules.
Bye. We say what&#39;s being evaluated. We&#39;re going to choose people. Then we want to include rotations that we want to submit the final grades for.
So far we only have two selected. We want to add all of them or if there are some that should be excluded such as this emergency medicine, we can exclude them.
Again, this is something that is entirely dependent on the school&#39;s needs. Who will complete this form? Here&#39;s where we can choose individuals that are scheduled to the block schedule and meet the following roles.
And this is where we would choose that specific role that we set for the final grade administrator. And then who will be evaluated?
It&#39;s going to be the third year students. Will it be automatically assigned? And we&#39;re going to say yes. Then we can put in a rule in here that says, you know, five days from the end of the rotation and so on.
And then go back and say and and and uh. save it. There&#39;s a final step for this is right now the system doesn&#39;t know that this individual is going to be uh individual is going to be uh assigned for into all these rotations.
So we have the person, we have the rotation, we have them as designated as administrator, but we also want to tell the system that this individual is in uh in this particular rotation.
To do that, we go into block schedules and create a new schedule. And for this new schedule, we&#39;re going to choose the entire academic year, you know, the start date and end date.
Uhm, so we&#39;re going to create a new block schedule. Choose July 2nd to June 28th, 2025. And we&#39;re going to choose the role, so it&#39;s that new role for that individual that we selected.
And then save it. And we don&#39;t need to auto-generate blocks. Instead, we&#39;re going to go to manage blocks and designate one rotation from the beginning of the academic period till the end of the academic period.
And then we open it up and assign. Thank you. this individual to all of these, all of the rotations. So they will have.
So they&#39;ll have a uhm. For the entire year, they&#39;re going to be assigned to each of those core rotations. Then as students are completing each rotation.
The system will check to see if the criteria is met, if it&#39;s five days from the end of the rotation, or whatever the criteria it is.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e0f31bda4c064c3fb21fe66922ac748b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setting Up Final Grade Report and Automation Rules</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Robin, so in this video we&#39;ll cover how to set up the final grade report and the automation rules for that form.
First thing you&#39;ll note here is that we have this setting enabled. This is the only form that we have enabled to review prior performance.
The way that this works is if you have an evaluation form assigned, actually let&#39;s say there&#39;s uhm five evaluation forms that are assigned to the internal medicine rotation and one of those forms is this final grade report.
At the end of the rotation, when an individual opens up this form, if they are designated as the rotation administrator, they will be able to see the submissions of the other four, four forms and then submit this form.
So this if there&#39;s an administrator they can review all of the different uh forms and their performance data and then make a determination on what the final grade should be.
So essentially it&#39;s a summative form. And then we create these questions on here based on whatever information you need and then move on to the next slide.
Next form, next page, and here&#39;s where we set up the automation rules. First thing is what&#39;s being evaluated. So this is going to be a form uhm.
We&#39;re going to set this up as a form that&#39;s evaluating uhm. Evaluating the people in the rotation and then we want to include all of the rotations that we want, uh, we need a final grade.
So, for San Juan, I believe we have to select all of them. The only thing that I&#39;m not sure about is the emergency medicine.
I&#39;ll make sure that we have a final report being generated for that. Um, once they&#39;re activated, then we want to say who will complete this form.
And here here&#39;s where it gets a little tricky. What we can do is create a user group called final grade um administrator and then put that user that completes all these final grade reports into that group.
And then we go into the rotation and add this individual as a rotation supervisor for all of those rotations and we specify that we want to include rotation supervisors that match this user group because we don&#39;t want to send it out to all rotation supervisors.
We only want to have it sent out to this one individual. So we don&#39;t have any groups here, that&#39;s why we&#39;re not seeing that here, but if we had a group set up on the user&#39;s page, so let&#39;s go to the user&#39;s page here.
Thank you for your time. Have a Take care. We go to groups, and we can create a new group and add that individual to that group.
Then we go to rotations under schedules and we want to designate this individual as the supervisor and as an admin.
We need to designate as a supervisor to target the evaluation assignment. We want to designate that individual as an administrator so they have the permissions to view evaluations that were submitted.
So to do assign a supervisor we simply edit and then we click faculty slash staff that will designate them as administrators.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0302e9420860439386bf4138e9cf9935</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setting Up Final Grade Report Form 👩‍🏫</pre></td><td><pre>This video will take a look at how to set up that final grade form, final grade report. So if we look at this form, we have a setting enabled called review prior performance.
If this is enabled on a form, when a faculty or preceptor or whoever is the evaluator tries to complete this form, we will show a section at the top that displays all of the other forms that were submitted on the same rotation.
So let&#39;s say we have a student that is assigned to internal medicine and this individual has four different forms that are assigned to them, each collecting something different.
That, at the end of that rotation, if we have a final grade report assigned to another person, they will be able to see all of those five forms that were submitted during that same rotation.
This allows them to review that performance from those five forms and submit that five final grade report. It takes a little bit of setup to do this, so we have this form that&#39;s already configured.
We want to make sure that this is attached to the rotations that require the final grade. So, I believe all of the rotations need to be activated, but that can be confirmed.
Maybe not emergency medicine, uhm, but any, anything that can require the final grade submission we want to enable, and who will be completing this form.
So, for this, what we want to do is, uh, it&#39;s going to be important for us to set up a user group where we have that person that&#39;s designated as an evaluator.
So we&#39;re going to add that person to a group and then select that group. person as as the uh so in order for us to set this up we&#39;re going to select the rotations and then for who would who should complete this form we&#39;re going to choose this last option all rotation supervisors</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4944b06e529042d9a6e0267a4d3641ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design Feedback on Interface Elements</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, it&#39;s it&#39;s starting to look better and I&#39;m starting to see the hierarchy forming. Something still doesn&#39;t feel right and I think maybe it&#39;s all the um the variation in sizes.
Like the buttons on the right side, like for example this expanded. It collapsed to a different size than edit, um and it looks like the one for the group is not aligned with the group and it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re editing a screenshot, um but when we give this to the developer, we want to make sure
they pay attention to that, um. And then, this um, groups and this icon on the right side and the objectives and the icon on the right side, uh what are your thoughts on adding a line or something underneath to connect it?
These two things kind of floating in the air makes a little odd because of the, makes a little odd because, for example, horse details is contained within this, uhm, and I&#39;m, I&#39;m thinking that we have a very light grey or white line that connects.
that&#39;s underneath this, uhm, it may anchor that better. But it&#39;s, yeah, I think right now, it&#39;s, now I&#39;m seeing the hierarchy better, like the, the size, the, the icons, uhm, it looks better than what we had done before.
And then, question is also, do we want to simply use these gray icons, or black icons, or do we want to pick a color that we use for all the icons that are inside of the page?
You know, that&#39;s a relatively neutral color, but uhm, maybe black is better, I don&#39;t know. Anyway, wanted to throw some more random thoughts at you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b9f7311e0ded448b8f2bcadaf3b2cb7a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design Feedback and Suggestions 🎨</pre></td><td><pre>Morning Mike. I really like this concept here of making it, using the colors to separate what you worked on, what is coming up next.
The other thing I&#39;m not sure is uh whether we need both the colors on this icon and the blue background.
I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s the only thing, whether we can get away with simply halving. Out of all of these, I like this one the most.
We can, Maybe what we can do is uh put this icon and color the header Essentially sort of like what we&#39;ve been doing with the cards But the cards always been just this thick gray background with the text Maybe what we can do is make the card header different with an icon uhm and then date range in the
text I agree with uh That&#39;s the only thing that I I&#39;m wondering is, actually, I&#39;m wondering if this groups and objectives are course details.
Uhm, or I guess maybe we can treat them as separate uhm I like the idea of, you know, if we expand on what you have done with this icons.
And we have like a header. That. Of the course details. And then we have. We do something similar to their where it has a an icon and the card header.
So that. Each of these are going to be shown for every course. So there&#39;s always a course icon, a groups icon.
An objective icon and sessions icon and I think it&#39;s okay for them to be. I think yeah, like if we&#39;re going to put course details or course.
It would be good for us to include this whole top section. Because it&#39;s all part of the course and then there&#39;s sessions because otherwise if it if you&#39;re kind of floating this objectives by itself.
Then it may not be clear that these are course objectives because we also have sessions underneath it. So, but if it&#39;s all together.
And then. We create, figure out a way to create a hierarchy, maybe for the course details. We use the icon and.
Um, card header, and maybe for these down here, we simply use the icon and. The text, the icon will help create more of a visual hierarchy than simply having the text, because right now, when I&#39;m looking at it, it&#39;s not easy to see the hierarchy.
These like blue backgrounds and stuff, like if I&#39;m just gestalting the whole page, um what sticks out to me are these blues, and so the hierarchy is not there.
Like overall, there&#39;s nothing that is giving me a layout of the page where I can see that the course is the title, groups are next, then objectives, and then I have a whole large section called sessions.
So the two main sections are courses, course details, and sessions. The sub sections are groups and details. I mean objectives.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7ab787de65ff48acb32edc880a88ea1e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Student Evaluation Process Optimization</pre></td><td><pre>There&#39;s a student eval of externship which is fine.

Yeah, and then so when we create this yeah so it says oh gee whatever it is we just put the outstanding as a very uh Likert scale and then the description we put that under the question we put this and then we can enable the comments.
Umm. So again, so the outstanding we put as a likert and then we do the rest we do. So yeah, so we can put it because those comments are specific to the question so we don&#39;t have a way to say put a comment at the bottom of each we just say question and the description would go in here.
Okay. And then if I save this I can say a require comment. Well, I guess we don&#39;t want to be required.
Uhm. So we can let&#39;s skip this comment under each of these for now. We just. Just put a one general comment at the bottom.
Okay. Cause I always try to talk them out of this cause nobody wants to write comments for every single thing.
Uh, I typically recommend they put it for if they put unsatisfactory. Okay. So let&#39;s put the top which is negative download or is there a setting that I&#39;m going to click on where?
Where? On the hand or if you don&#39;t. Uhm. Uhm. . . . Negative. E-valice is saved. Download, export, tally, sheet, excel. No, I wouldn&#39;t even, I would just ignore that.

Cases, templates, and then we would actually we&#39;re going to manage diagnosis and that&#39;s where we would enter umm. Actually we have something called.
cpt. and institutional portal under. Customize case codes. umm so this is you can. up. and then on the umm cases, law, I mean templates.
It&#39;s going to be. . I make a diagnosis. Yes, so the only thing that uh if we look at this is going to be we&#39;re going to activate.
. . gender, age, and then uh race for example. We don&#39;t have a race one. But what we can do is go to custom fields and create a race, multiple choice, and then when we create the template at the bottom, they&#39;re able to add custom fields, like pick the custom fields you want to include.
Um, and the CPT codes, um, I think once it, once you make it, I&#39;ll figure out a way to have it show.
I don&#39;t remember exactly, um, on the institutional portal where you upload that. So that&#39;s CPT codes and then, so for CPT codes, it&#39;s um, it, it may be, we we have, um, the code and the name.
If we, I don&#39;t think we have like a category for that. So what we can do is, um. Let&#39;s see.
You know, uh, screw this, putting it into the CPT code. We&#39;ll just put it in directly into the uh, um, procedures that we can create a category.
It&#39;s the- The category is going to be, uhm, established phase patient, and then the code will be this, and then the procedure name will be that.
Okay. And that will also be- uploaded. Then we got student eval. So it&#39;s the same thing. And then there&#39;s a student rating at the bottom.
And I&#39;ll see you So competencies. So this is something that uh I will have to uhm. I&#39;m not gonna explain this one.
I&#39;ll take care of that for now. Or at least I&#39;ll talk to Chris and Maria to help with that. Cause you gotta convert it in a certain way.
Permissions, whatever. This one is also a yep. And what was on you? Well curriculum. Break it up. So this curriculum one is, here&#39;s the course code.
Here&#39;s the uh course. And here&#39;s the objectives for that. So essentially what we want to use is go to. The curriculum.
Umm. We have a way to import a list of courses here. Chad GPT yeah. This column. And this column.

Eight. Not sure if that just went straight to voicemail or if my phone is uh See, let&#39;s go to the other room because I&#39;m having a little bit of a bar here.
Let&#39;s see what I sent him. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. I if his phone has like a focus time thing on.
Because that happens to me during the day. Like his doctor will call me and be like oh shit. It was on like office do not disturb.
Oh really? Okay. Maybe try texting him. So a uh an idea that not a one-on-one. I&#39;m not going to bring this up in the first meeting, but um this is something that I had a few years ago about how to break into the GME market with all this competitive new innovations that MetaHop dominate in the market.
Redfin has done for the real estate market and essentially what they did was they took this commission model that real estate agents has and said instead of us keeping three percent, we&#39;re going to take 1.5 percent and if the if you&#39;re using our budget platform to find a house, you&#39;re going to get paid
half that. So that&#39;s basically how the Redfin real estate model works. You&#39;re, you&#39;re saving half, 1.5 percent on the commission because Redfin only takes out, if you were a regular agent, it&#39;s three percent.
And for even from when the company started, I was thought in the GM&#39;s mind in the ME world anyway, the bigger money maker or potential is recruitment.
You know, finding physicians for like they pay, like physicians, commissions and stuff for recruitment is very high. Recruiting residents or recruiting attendings?
Both. Like residents to attendings. Yeah. Like once you graduate, you have to find a job. Yeah. And if you go, there&#39;s a lot of fees associated with that because hospitals are struggling to find uhm where it&#39;s a very lucrative market and everyone is getting into it.
But at the same time, everyone is very inefficient at communicating. So we&#39;re with residents because even when I was looking for a job, a lot, tons of people were just spamming you or sending you stuff.
And then I ended up finding on a job board, temple. We have, if we&#39;re successful in the GME market, you have all of the uhm trainee data, trainees all using the system at the same time.
And if you make it in a way that you can connect those people with jobs, because every person that&#39;s graduating need to find a job.
Like that&#39;s, you have to graduate and find a job. And finding a physician uhm a job, that&#39;s a very difficult thing.
Uhm, a beneficial thing for. So it&#39;s like the match. It&#39;s like the match, but it&#39;s, match actually is an algorithm that matches you.
You rank it, but this is more of like just connecting employers, it&#39;s like basically a job board. Uhm, but with data.
Like you, you can say, I want to reach internal medicine doctors in the United States that are in their senior year.
And, and we have a platform where they&#39;re using it on a daily basis. Uhm, so and, and we have the data.
If I want to interest, I&#39;m interested in a job, I don&#39;t have to email a bunch of files. I can just say, share my data with this hospital.
And, uh. So So, but would that mean, so all the schools, that&#39;s good. No, no. I just want to make sure I don&#39;t have anything.
All the schools that are on our platform. So, yeah. I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head which one.
Kaiser, for example. Yeah. So, Kaiser. Kaiser&#39;s got its residents on our platform. Yeah. Somebody is looking to hire a outgoing resident.
Yeah. To be an attending at their hospital. Would they then, so then they would have a subscription? So, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the part I haven&#39;t really figured out how to model it.
So, they would like Redfin model that I had was basically you want to incentivize um residents to use our platform to find the system.
Because why would they use ours versus like any other job board? So, that&#39;s where if. Where I&#39;m stuck though is like I understand like the hospitals buying a subscription.
Yeah. To be able to like put up postings and receive data from people that are interested. Yeah. But what I wasn&#39;t clear about was for the residents to be using our platform.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5ad16735074944aeab0ade725cef9e5c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Email Management Insights 📧</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so I&#39;m just going to run through these ah emails.

So sales email. Silvana&#39;s handling it. This one. New JIRA ticket. So it looks like we&#39;re gonna need to send, uh.
Staff counts. Gonna add you to this. Center, uh. So mark, uh, for additional month. So, we, this is a client that, uh, is listed.
leaving Metrix and they ask for an extra month and it looks like it&#39;s the, um, they want to ask for another month.
And this is also what Mark&#39;s mentioning here. Sorry current commitment was until the end of July. Now they&#39;re asking for another month, um, we can Yeah, I&#39;ll let you take this one and either is fine we can either say no or we well no for free and we can bill for the month or we can say we can do another
month but if it has to go longer than that we need to charge so that we make sure they off for it.
But it is a good note here that they were trying to onboard for Med Hub and for some reason they still are not ready to switch over, um.
so maybe there&#39;s an opportunity for us to ask what&#39;s going on. I don&#39;t know what this is. Spam. Alexandra D.
Sales. Whatever. I was able to make a DIR request at an urgent meeting at 8am. Alright, so this is the Natasha who&#39;s going to be doing the webinars.
See no problem So we want to make sure that we are staying up with her Keeping up with her to make sure that she integrates into the metrics Processes kind of she&#39;s an outsider And if we don&#39;t Put that effort from our end It&#39;s not going to happen.
So right now for example One of the things i&#39;m noticing is she&#39;s not including everybody in the emails She&#39;s not using that channel It&#39;s she still feels like an outsider.
I want to try to Get her into calls so that she feels more comfortable with the team and is more proactive with with the with the communication So what i&#39;m gonna say is no tasha you will share That&#39;s sad.
Tasha. The virtual patient talk that we did, was that during evaluations? Virtual, yeah, yeah. Was that on the staging server?
I don&#39;t see the log on there. That was staging server. Oh no, the actual form is on the production. Production, yeah.
Is there a login for production? Yeah, you would look for the name of the client, and it&#39;s going to be admin at MetrixLab, whatever the password is in there.
Alright, so, I&#39;m trying to clean this crap up. So here, we send a proposal. Uhm. And then, this is a brand new bedside table.
We declare that by the end of the year, this person needs to be on board with any new solutions for our college.
Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m just going to send a, Since I met him, this guy used to be at LMU and he&#39;s now working on starting up a new school.
And it&#39;s not going to start until 2026. So this is this is uh so they&#39;re saying they need to hire a dean and what I&#39;m saying I like to say that I&#39;m adding a reminder because I want him to know that I don&#39;t want to just leave it open ended as I may reach out uhm I&#39;m actually going to put something more
even more specific Yeah, check back with you. late November so that way he knows I&#39;ll be reaching out and it&#39;s not just the end of our discussion in late so I want to do is send this and then also give an explanation for what I&#39;m saying to That&#39;s good.
So this is, they deposited an ACH test So what we can do is, go into Zeni Click on the balance at the top.
That will So I think this is probably fine, even if it&#39;s not fine, it&#39;s fine because I don&#39;t want us to pay $800 per hour to modify this.
So I&#39;m just gonna say So what we can do with this one is, let&#39;s put this in. uh put this in templates okay, so That is in there.
Um, the next big project Well Not necessarily Next big one because it&#39;s been a project already Let&#39;s see, from So these are some of the contracts that Alejandra had wrote up that we need to send out and get approved.
These are all for our contractors. Some of these will require some discussion. But I&#39;ll take this and add it to our board.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2d2e2fe704f54771854a0dc2807f17cf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding User Permissions and Portals in the Company Model</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video we&#39;re going to review different permissions and portals and affiliations and metrics and summarize most of the ways that we can grant users access to the system.
So, starting at the code level, in the company model we have what is labelled or hardcoded as resident equals resident, student equals student, um faculty equals faculty, staff equals staff.
So, essentially this is defining the different portals that we have or the personal portals that we have. So, there are four personal portals.
And when we first built Ventrix in back in 2013-2014, we had initially called all of it resident, uh uh staff, and attending, because we were focused on residency programs, but over the years we have expanded to all other types of health care training, and then renamed the faculty, the attending to faculty
, and staff remained the same, and then we also realized that resident is a little too limiting and we have medical students, so we expanded to student, um, but the student portal was created using Ventrix.
using the resident portal with some changes, a couple of pages that are removed and a couple of pages that are added.
Then on the user&#39;s level, we have resident, student, staff, and faculty, so for some reason we call this medical student, but it would be any type of student, um.
Would have been better if we called it student, but same concept. You have four different types of users and every, each of these can have roles that are more granular and custom defined for each type of learner.
The resident profile, these are different profiles that match with the user types and again, here is uhm, I guess from a code perspective, I&#39;m assuming this is defining the different types of users.
So, each portal has one user type that is linked to it. If I have a resident user, then they&#39;re going to accessed in the resident portal.
If I have a student user, then they&#39;re going to access the student portal. When we get to roles, I&#39;ll explain how there&#39;s a way for you to change the roles.
And then change the user type based on that. We added that functionality two or three years ago. So with that understanding, let&#39;s go to the next section here.
Here we have administrative portals. There are two types of administrative portals. There&#39;s the institutional portal, which has functionality that is used on the institutional level, and they can access data from all of the different training programs.
So we call this admin portal. It&#39;s really program admin portal, and it&#39;s meant to capture all department level access within an institution.
So if you have a medical school, usually they only have one program in here. But if they have a hospital with several departments, each of them will have its own program.
Infectious disease, nephrology, hand surgery. They have their own users and their own uh data. Then we talked about personal portals.
If I have a role assigned to me as a user and it&#39;s a role that is linked to the faculty user type.
So use a ruler. The roles are custom created for the client and each user role has to be linked to a user type and they&#39;re given um access to a specific portal based on that user type.
A role can be changed. So if I was a resident, then I graduated and I became a faculty, I can change my role from resident PGY3, for example, as a resident role to a faculty role and then I lose access to that resident portal and are and it&#39;s given to the access to the faculty portal.
And as I come down here I label this as attending because I was under the impression in the back end it&#39;s still called attending, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true.
Actually, it looks like it is attending physician profiles faculty. So there are some things that we haven&#39;t renamed, but it works fine and it it&#39;s not a big deal for us to leave it that way.
And it generally is also correct in the most of our clients where attending physicians are the faculty. So user types are hard-coded into the system.
User roles are defined by client and each type can have a bunch of roles based on their actual operational needs.
User, users have a status. So the user&#39;s model has a user type status and it&#39;s active or inactive. This defines whether that user can log into the system.
Then each program in the system which is in the back end is called residency program, even though we do more than residency program in the back end the model is still called residency program, but we have on the front end we simply call it programs.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/70ec6e01f92c4166b4b0966e6211e756</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Financial Presentation 📊</pre></td><td><pre>So for looking at this document, I&#39;m going to ask for these questions. We don&#39;t want to include the cache runway.
And for this slide, I think we can move that down. Uh, I mean one of the big things that we&#39;re not including here that we want to highlight, for example, like starting off with expenses and loans.
That&#39;s the first thing that they see, um, may not be the best thing for them to focus on. Instead, if we can move up, um, the most important thing is for us to show ARR, so we can say, um, in Q1, what was our ARR, Q2, what was ARR, and what the growth is, and then, um, if we can also show breakdown of
, um, new revenue in 20, um, new revenue in from new contracts versus expansion, I think that can be the top section, and then it&#39;s okay, then we can show all of these other items for expenses and loans.
Yeah, I&#39;ll be done soon, and then we have uhm, yeah, this is perfect, I think that&#39;s good, that&#39;s all we need to include on for the loans, uh for new clients.
Okay. Yeah, this is all, this is perfect and I think maybe for the next time we can work on a way to uhm Like maybe in the next time we can have this a table with, with uhm the list of the clients, the market segment, so GME, UME, Allied, and so on, and then put all the logos together at the bottom,
uhm Actually, we might be able to do that now, because I, I said how we can show new clients and expan- expansions, instead of uhm adding that to the top, maybe we can put this as a second slide and simply we show it as a table that has the new data.
New client table, expansion table, and uhm what the cli- market segment is, the value, and then at the top, at the bottom of the table will be the total for the new clients versus expansion.
Growth strategies. Wonder if we need to provide some context here. Yeah, or maybe we can just remove it. For now, because it you know we have Q1 lead generators 33, but the opportunities is 39.
I know that some of these is probably from previous leads, but it may not be clear to them, and it may just something they don&#39;t care about.
But if we show this at the top and then we can say. Leads these leads were generated from the uhm.
From the uhm. ACGME. A a a a com conferences as well as through our marketing efforts. Uhm? That has increased our inbound leads.
It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. Uhm, for here I think we can add what it means to be an advocate so we can.
explain that advocates are individuals that we are confident they were they&#39;re giving us as a reference to other institutions or serving us as a reference when we need them to be.
And then for at at risk we can say that these are individual the clients that we may we may not have as of close of a relationship or there is a concern that they may switch.
I mean, I think it&#39;s mostly institutions that we haven&#39;t had close relationship with but we can uhm and then we can also point out how We are actively working on converting stable and at-risk clients forward into advocates and our goal is by the end of the year to get to about 75% as advocate.
And then for yeah that&#39;s fine we can leave that. I think what you have here is perfect for graphics. We can also highlight ChatWebby as like its own thing that we acquired them.
Can you even tell them that we acquired them for $5k? But we have uh Marcus, Marcus Roday Press release here, uh that we can use.
Probably use Jant GPT to take that press release and turn it into a page, uhm and then the other thing that we can do is uh.
Yeah, here we go. This is the design that we&#39;re working on for the new metrics.ai website. So we make a new page, we can call it acquisition of chat webby, and then have a few bullet points.
from that, from that uhm press release and then below we can show uhm upcoming product release metrics.ai and then explain how we are rebranding chat webby to metrics.ai and expand the capabilities so that it can be used by our clients and the university and hospital market.
This is great and it&#39;d be good if we can include uh links so that these investors can also follow that.
For Austin, we, uh, Augustin, we can call him. Senior Technical Lead, since that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to be going towards.
And then once we update this, we can take this PDF and give it to ChatGPT and ask it to create a summary that we can use here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fa1766edcf5441b985b016dbc007e7f8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Website Crawler Functionality</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, um, Zane, there was one area that Myself and a couple of the team members have found it somewhat confusing so when I&#39;m adding a new source Like we have this crawl sign For this here, actually, it&#39;d be nice to have a sample of what the URL for this format should look like, but let&#39;s say if I do this
, then I have something happening here, and then I also have a status menu at the top, uhm, and it&#39;s scraped successfully, And then I go to the next page.
Then I have all this data here, which is not what I added, it&#39;s from the old, uh, everything. Then I have this train bot.
I think instead of doing this, it would be awesome if we simply have this modal come up. And I say, I give, I input what I want, and then, let&#39;s say, uhm, I add a website, and I just say add, and it would automatically crawl the website, and then add it to this list.
This modal will just close. And I would have, I would have a confirmation that it was added, and at the top, I also have a button that says, if there, a train, a train the bot, a train chat bot, so that on this page, I have a train chat bot.
But on this page, all I&#39;m doing is adding. I don&#39;t need to have a second, a status bar or a menu, because it, this ends up being confusing, because I add something, and then I go to the next page, and I&#39;m given all this, and then I have another button.
But if I simply add it, every time I click I want to add something, I come to the, uh, uhm, add it, and then I can click the train chat bot, when I&#39;m ready to train it, once I&#39;ve added all my links, because let&#39;s say if I want to put, a website and a file, I put the website, I go to the next page, and
then I have to click train chat bot now, I can&#39;t add another one. But it may be best to put everything on the page, and then train chat bot.
Let me know your thoughts.

So the first thing we want to do is go to System Setup, Permissions. and then New Custom Permission Select a person Here we can go down and say Manage Evaluations for Site Select the site that we want this individual to manage Same thing for case logs.
I choose the same site. So anytime this individual is logging into the system, they will have the capacity to view evaluations that were submitted for rotations at that site and they will also be able to see case logs that were submitted for rotations at that site.
We also have the ability to do the same thing with groups and student documents if that&#39;s ever needed. So for example if I enable document access for this particular site, the site administrator will be able to go in there and see credentialing documents for for that student that is scheduled for a rotation
at that site. So John Smith is scheduled to a rotation at NYU and the NYU administrator is given access to that um for students documents.

Great job. Overall, this is uh looking much better than you used to. Had a couple of uh thing thoughts here.
One is um, very minor. We can get rid of that period there. Um, but the other thing is we want to start to get more consistent.
With how we are using this rounded corners versus circular. Um, so some places we&#39;re using square, some places we are using rounded.
So I think it&#39;s best if we come up with like a radius. Uhm, of, well, first thing we can say is we should always use rounded corners instead of this circle.
Uhm, like what I, I like what you have done here. This is probably like the, the ideal curvature that we want to have.
And then we can apply that to this top button, this thing in the middle, and then also for this announcements.
Uhm, and then The other piece that I wanted to mention is, uhm, uhm, the, this background image and this fade.
It looks like a little off when you have it abruptly changing like this. If there&#39;s a way for us to make this blend in or have the whole thing blurred, that may look a little cleaner.
Yeah, that&#39;s all I had.

And this is going to be a doc, this is going to be used to create a document that that we can share with sales leads on what makes us unique and so they can compare it with other companies in the market.
However, we don&#39;t want to come off, uh, this document should not be a direct comparison. We want to talk about us instead of saying we&#39;re better than them.
We&#39;re just, this is what we focus on instead of, uh, a direct comparison because we&#39;re not necessarily, uh, uhm, like we, we&#39;re a company that believes in the, uh, infinite game, playing the infinite game from Simon Sinek where it&#39;s not about winning and losing.
It&#39;s about how we provide more values to our customers. So, I want to go through a few things and we&#39;re going to use, I&#39;d like you to use this transcript to create that document.
Uh, company ownership, uh, metrics is almost entirely owned by physician investors and employees which is an unusual thing in the, in our market where companies are often, uh, acquired by, investment firms and private equity and there are, uh, very few, uh, software companies in healthcare that is owned
by investors that are physicians. And why is, this matters, you know, a company&#39;s ownership and the shareholders heavily influences how the company makes money.
Decisions, you know, when, when you are, uh, or when you are owned by health professionals, the company&#39;s core mission is to provide value to healthcare.
You know, it&#39;s not, we want to make sure that we&#39;re providing ROI to investors, but our mission is our number one focus and our customers and are having a positive impact in healthcare is.
That&#39;s what&#39;s more important. And we also believe that this long-term strategy of providing value to our customers and having a positive impact will also have a greater impact on our, for our investors, and then have a greater ROI.
When it comes to the platform itself, um, our focus is on usability. Specifically, usability for our, uh, students, residents, and faculty members, because these individuals have to focus on patience, and that&#39;s their primary responsibility.
When it comes to a software system like Metrix, we want to make it as easy as possible for them to get things done, so they are spending less time.
time looking around and trying to do their administrative tasks. So this number one focus on usability and all of our decisions around the product is based on cutting down on the workload for educators.
Metrix is also built from the ground up to be a competency-based evaluation system. Competency-based management system, which is what more and more healthcare education programs are going towards.
It was also built from the ground up for the AAMC&#39;s curriculum inventory. And this goes back to when you&#39;re building a new house, you if you&#39;re building it from the ground up and everything is built for that new design.
It&#39;s going to turn out to be a better result than if you build something or if you if you add on it rooms to an extra extra rooms to an existing house.
So for example when the curriculum inventory came along we built all of that from scratch and we started in the UME market.
And it wasn&#39;t something in existing houses. platform that we adjusted to make it work. Then it comes to uh recruiting and hiring at Metrix.
We like to hire team members from medical schools, nursing schools, and GME programs so that they&#39;re bringing that industry knowledge uh with them.
Each of our uh we believe that software is only 50% of the battle and the other half is domain expertise.
Technology can only be as useful as how it&#39;s implemented by having these individuals who worked in healthcare and hospitals and universities allows us to get a deep understanding of our community.
Our customers&#39; processes and help them create new processes that transform their learning environments. And how we, our client onboarding is handled very hands-on.
We like to structure this as two to three months of weekly meetings where we meet with you to understand your processes.
And help you build new processes in the system. And during this time, we ask questions that help you make decisions.
We help you create documentation. And we train you on how to use the platform. After onboarding, during customer support, we have a live chat that is built into the platform.
This means that all of the administrators can reach our team directly from the system, without having to wait for tickets or opening up an email outlook and sending us an email.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cd96d87a7509410f84f8fea4f165ee9d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Internal and External Roles and Sites in User Management System 👥</pre></td><td><pre>So in we have internal roles and external roles, and then we have internal sites and external sites. So under the sites page, if you look here, we have each site designated as internal or external.
And then on the company portal, I mean on the institution portal, if we go to roles here, we have various roles, and then each of them are categorized as internal or external.
How these two things work together is when a user is created, we have to define what that user&#39;s home institution is.
So if I click, let&#39;s say a student, down to the bottom, I could pick one of the sites as that student&#39;s home institution.
When I select a home institution, I am presented with a set of roles. These roles are going to match the internal or external designation of the home institution.
So if the home institution is classified as a internal, then I will only be able to select internal roles. If I choose an external role, then I would only be able to select the external, sorry if I choose an external site, then I can only select external roles.
And the reason that we implemented this was because we wanted to prevent human error. So if you have a hospital that has medical students that are coming from um from uh different universities and they have their own medical students that is considered internal, then when I choose, our home institution
has our own organization, then I want the administrators to only be able to select the internal roles. But if you have visiting students coming from different universities, when I choose one of those universities, I will only be able to select external roles.
So that&#39;s those two fields work together to ensure that our data is clean and that the appropriate roles are assigned to users when they&#39;re created in the system.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a385336e9ec84e77a6aa3eea8ae7b31d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Simplified Curriculum Management System Overview 📚</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon Jackie, I hope you had a great weekend and some relaxing time off after doing some of the extra coverage that you described.
Given that you have a lot on your plate, I wanted to send you this video so that you can check it out on your own time and we don&#39;t have to meet if I got everything correct here.
If we. We&#39;ll. If you do want to meet and go over something in in more detail, I can be available later in the week.
So essentially, this is a simplified curriculum that includes all of the necessary modules and uhm all of your users, all those trainees from from your preclinical and clinical.
training. This is going to allow you to do all the scheduling, evaluations, documentation tracking, grade tracking, as well as various site management, case logging, all in in one system.
And uh we can onboard them, the preclinical and clinical as two separate onboarding series. Essentially we would have a series of meetings for the onboard, the clinical students, um or the, and their processes, and another series of onboarding meetings for the preclinical since their operations are slightly
different. As for the curriculum, the AI part of curriculum mapping, it is something that is priced separately because it&#39;s an administrative tool, and it, this subscription includes the ability to create the curriculum map for all years of training, including the courses and the clinical rotations,
and then use, the AI tool to map the objectives. There is also a one-time onboarding fee, and this is something that uhm allows us to onboard the platform, and it&#39;s done as a series of weekly meetings.
This cost is for two onboarding series, one for personnel. One preclinical, and one for clinical, so we would have weekly meetings for about two to two and a half months for preclinical and curriculum being getting set up, and another series of meetings for about two and a half to three months for clinical
. We can run both of those in parallel, as long as we have advanced notice and we have the capacity, or we can do it one after another.
And then, we also applied an overall 20% annual subscription discount, um, given that you&#39;re committing for all trainees, preclinical and clinical, and this is applied to the entire subscription. And then, this one, uh, implementation waiver, this is for, uh, making a commitment now, for next year.
If you&#39;re able to, um, make that decision and we start moving towards the contract, and get everything signed and ready for next year, um, we can also waive the, uh, implementation fee, and slowly get started this year by configuring things and getting some of your data into the system, um, so that by
April, we have some things already ready to go, and we already have a scheduled onboarding, um, starting at that time.
Um, for us, this is helpful because it allows us to plan things in advance and make sure there&#39;s an institution ready to start onboarding, um, so for that, we can, we can waive the 10k, uh, if you&#39;re able to do that, so please let me know if there&#39;s any, uh, anything that I missed, and also look at the
overall subscription cost, and if that is in line with what you&#39;re looking for. If you, if we need to make any changes to it, uh, uh, we can talk through these modules again and see if there&#39;s something that needs to be adjusted, um, if the, if the budget needs to be lower, um, let me know, and, uh,
if everything is good, um, I can ask our team to send you a draft of our contract. So please so we can get started with that process.
And if your IT team needs to do a security review, we can also speak to them to get, get that, uh, paperwork done.
Thank you and you have a good rest of the day.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5a052de9332d48da9dcc71698684debf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Configuring Site-Level Administrator Permissions and Metrics 👩‍💻</pre></td><td><pre>This video will take a look at how to configure permissions and metrics for site-level administrators. Under System Setup and Permissions, we have the ability to add custom permissions.
So here I can select a specific person, such as Derek Shepard. And then, there are several permissions that you can give this individual.
So, for example, if I give this individual the ability to manage users for the site, and I choose Metrics Hospital East, it&#39;s going to give this individual the ability to view profiles Thank joining us.
of um students that are scheduled to that site. If you want to give them the ability to create preceptors for that site, we can also enable that setting here.
So, with this configuration, a user named Derek Shepard will be able to view the profiles of students that are scheduled to that site and be able to create preceptors with the home institution as Metrix Hospital West.
They would not be able to create any other type of users. Or create users for a different hospital. So essentially locking it down for that particular hospital or clinic.
If you come down there&#39;s another site level permission. Um this one is for creating groups for a particular site. This is mainly for um schools that require custom groups.
Groups for assigning evaluations. We can do the same thing. We can enable the setting and select the site. And then the administrator will be able to go in there and create a group.
And that group will automatically, automatically link to that particular site. We have the ability to give student document access for a particular site.
So if we have, let&#39;s say, immunization records or other credentialing information that you want the site level administrator to have, let&#39;s say Metrics Hospital West, anytime we schedule a student to this particular hospital, the administrator at that hospital will be able to see the documents for those
students. Then we come down to evaluations and case logs. So if I enable this, and I enable this setting, we are now allowing Derek Shepard to do evaluations for rotations at this particular site.
Or, we are giving up. Giving Derek the ability to view case logs that were submitted for rotations at this particular site.
So this is a way for them to monitor what&#39;s getting submitted and ensure that they are meeting all the expectations of the university.
The final setup here is um site level access for schedules. So that&#39;s done on the schedules itself. So if I go to schedules, clinical schedules, we have a a block schedule that we have created here.
I&#39;m going to go back in time and choose something called let&#39;s say master plan. Schedule 2020 that has 48 users on it.
If I go to edit, I can come down and specify one or more administrators. And these administrators could be from different and I&#39;ll sites. So hospital X got hospital Y and we may put in, put multiple individuals here.
And then if you enable this checkbox, only show schedule details for sites the user has permission to view. That means uhm Arnold Arnold Arnoldson, if he is an administrator for hospital X, then he would only be able to see schedules from hospital X.
All other schedules on the block schedule will say external site. So we can use this to configure access with the site-level administrators and then enable this checkbox to prevent them from seeing assignments for other hospitals.
And then there&#39;s also a view-only access options here. This is helpful if you want to give full view access to the entire schedule, but these individuals will be able to see the all the assignments and are not going to limited to a specific site.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7dc9b20b07fb412fab409692091466ff</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Proposal for Curriculum Mapping 👩‍🏫</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Jackie, I hope you had a relaxing weekend. I wanted to send you this video so that you have this information and don&#39;t have to worry about hopping on a call if your schedule is tight.
I know that with being short-staffed you probably have other things you have to cover. This video will summarize the changes we made to the module.
And then if there&#39;s any questions I can answer in an email, and if we do need to have a call, I can be available later in the week.
So, this is a simplified proposal that includes all of your learners and all of the modules that are necessary for managing preclinical.
as well as clinical education, and then the AI powered curriculum mapping module for all of the uh uhm courses and rotations.
So, this this is based on the all the modules are based on the learners. The AI curriculum mapping is a standalone module that would allow you to build out the curriculum, um and give all the faculty access to it.
And then there&#39;s the one-time implementation cost. We also, since we are going to be applying it for all of the students, we also applied a 20 percent volume pricing.
Discount for for all students, um actually the full subscription. And this is something that we can keep in place for however long you&#39;re going to sign the agreement for.
And the other thing that we wanted to speak to you about was, um, I know that we can&#39;t get started now, and we&#39;re going to aim for July start date for the licensing.
And if we put the agreement together and start the process now and get it signed with the payment and, um, with the payment and the onboarding starting next year, as long as the commitments meet.
We can waive that implementation fee, um, so that you&#39;re saving some more upfront cost. Essentially, this would also allow us to get you the server early this year and get you in the system.
And if we have capacity on your end, we can even start loading some data. Um, performance. For us, essentially, that&#39;s also giving us a commitment for next year and, uh, making sure that we&#39;re having other institutions starting in April, um, rather than having to restart this conversation in January.
Um, it&#39;s basically we&#39;ll be ready to go. So if that is something that&#39;s possible from your end. We&#39;re more than happy to waive the one-time implementation fee.
Please let me know if this is all in line with what you&#39;re looking for. If there&#39;s any issues with the budget, we can also look at any of these modules and see if we need to modify something.
For example, we need to remove a module to bring the price lower. We can explore that further. But if this is all good, then we can let you have a draft.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8a0a2aa1751d45dc818cbed1a1c5d9de</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>SAS Agreement Update 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alondra, so I&#39;m looking at Garnet and she mentioned a few things here, subscription fees, why is the fee not listed as less done in the previous agreement, so if we looked at the last year&#39;s agreement this one actually, last year&#39;s agreement you can see that we did have the list of the modules and
then we also have the trainees listed out here with the per trainee price. So if we looked at here, this is an updated template that I made last week, or a couple weeks ago.
Let me see when, I don&#39;t remember when I updated this. This was uhm, missing from this section. And I added the top section.
Let&#39;s see. Can&#39;t recall when it was updated, but anyway, so we have this thing that we have to change We had to replace this top part.
I already, this template is already in here. I&#39;m gonna rename this to SAS Agreement Help 2024. And we&#39;ll put that as per trainee per year.
And then this is meant to capture the modules that they purchased. So if we look at last year&#39;s agreement, it has all of the modules.
So we can, let&#39;s skip this for now. the bottom part and we&#39;ll just call this call it that and she mentions that they&#39;re not doing implementation so we don&#39;t want to include that but the other thing she also calls out is we sent a contract to a to her with this we never want to send them a contract with
this x hours because it&#39;s saying we need to fill that in so what i&#39;m going to do is just delete this either we had to fill it in or we had to delete it so i&#39;m going to delete this and say we don&#39;t need it and then here it says less than 50 resident users but they actually have according to the last year&#39;s
contract 115 student trainees so it should be zero here and then and at the bottom page 23 initial For this one, let&#39;s see Okay, so what we need to do is, confirm two things.
One, let&#39;s make sure that, show you this contract says one hundred, but the invoice says one oh five. ahem So what we want to do is email her and ask her.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7897e987563a4630a26f53c97a2ce8fa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Contract Template Update Review</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alejandro, so if we look at this template, so new template So I updated this ah contract template ah I don&#39;t remember, a week or two ago, maybe a week ago to include the pricing here.
So what we can do is look at their previous agreements and make sure we have updated it so we can replace what&#39;s here here with the same thing that&#39;s here.
So let&#39;s see I guess we can set it right replacing. So I want you to check the numbers please. Just to make sure this is correct.
Because if we went up by 3%, then we got to put in that 3% here. And then, yes, she is right that this doesn&#39;t apply to them.
I guess we sent them a contract with blank hours. Yeah, it looks like we copied somebody else&#39;s template and sent it to them.
This should not be less than 50 trainees. Yeah, we gotta make sure this is this is correctly done because this is showing less than 50 trainees when they actually have Why does it say 105 trainees so so this is last year&#39;s contract and it shows uhm 173 for 115 transactions trainees, but for some reason
, our new contract is showing 105 Five.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/84c94b675e5d4dad8299b30bbe30b3b5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Using ChatGPT for Sales Email Improvement 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to share how I typically use ChatGPT to improve my sales emails, especially, well usually when it&#39;s these kinds of complex situations.
So here I wrote the draft and then I give ChatGPT the scenario and I give it a screenshot. Prospect, we had many meetings with email back saying the champion has left.
Uhm, here&#39;s my response. And this question says, do you have any feedback as a senior sales leader who uses the challenger method?
So the challenger methodology is from this book. Uhm, and it&#39;s essentially a methodology where you are challenging the buyer&#39;s uhm way of thinking and providing them with new insights so that they are getting value from interacting with you as a salesperson and and seeing you as an expert not simply
a person that is showing them what they want to see and then they make a decision they&#39;re coming to you with a problem and it&#39;s a complex problem and they&#39;re learning something when they come to you and then you&#39;re change shifting the way that they think.
So I&#39;d like to, um, give that in the prompt so that chat GPT tries to incorporate those kind of ideas.
So here&#39;s a few suggestions and so what it does is it helps rewrite it but it&#39;s usually not perfect because sometimes it&#39;s too verbose.
So what I like to do is then take that and tweak it myself. So let&#39;s see here appreciate letting me know what kind of departure so I don&#39;t like how that it modified this Because I write in simple language this makes it More Did like what this part That can lead to loss of, given the situation So, what
it&#39;s doing here is, is changing it from, it&#39;s, this is a very, I use a very passive tone here, it&#39;s saying, I believe it&#39;s crucial, uhm, I&#39;m not a fan of this crucial here.
Because, uhm. I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s important for us to regroup with you and Dr. Muhammad to align priorities. So he&#39;s referring to him as Dr.
Muhammad. So that&#39;s a good change here where I refer to him as Islam. So it&#39;s best to model model what they the other person said and use Dr.

They have Ross University Medical School, Ross Vet School, Atalum AUC Medical School, and Chamberlain.
And been adding more and more of their institutions over to Metrix over the past few years. And like last year, we had that pricing discussion where we increased their rates.
And we came after like a month and a half of weekly meetings, we came to an agreement on the pricing.
And they were supposed to talk to each of the schools and get approval on the pricing. Then, uhm, uhm, and then this July is when the new pricing is supposed to kick in.
Last year, they had signed up for, uhm, signed up, uhm, the, the Chamberlain School of Nursing is broken up into Graduate Nursing, Doctorate Nursing, and BSN.
We had signed an agreement for bringing out all of their students, about 9,000 students, in chunks, Graduate Nursing first, then Doctorate, then eventually the biggest chunk, which is the BSN, which has about 6,000 students.
They were supposed to go live for that BSN this July, uhm, and they, we asked them to pay for it last year.
And they paid $240,000 for that agreement because we said, you know, they&#39;ve been, they&#39;ve been pushing back more and more on like the delays because of their IT resources.
And I said, we, in order for us to have some certainty in our financials, we need to know that you&#39;re starting in July and, and, uh, pay for it now.
We can&#39;t keep pushing this back. So since January, Chris has been working with them to do the onboarding for BSN and bring on the 6,000 students.
Um, then all of a sudden, um, last week, or like a couple weeks ago, Chris gets an email forwarded to us from their, uh, their product owner for Metrix.
Uh, we have a really good relationship with their IT department, so this was something that you know, they weren&#39;t, he wasn&#39;t supposed to forward it, but he, uh, had a conversation with Chris and forwarded this.
So this is what the email said. Um, this is an internal email chain. Discovery of external software development companies. Arshton, uh, I heard the decision to halt metrics for pre-licensure has been made.
Uh, I have not heard any decisions. I am meeting with Arshton tomorrow afternoon. Architecture team. Goal is to consult initial discovery of third-party vendors.
Recommend documenting pain points. Is it meeting and to get a better understanding of the shortcomings exist? Also assessment opportunity costs on cost.
Um, so this email was forwarded to us. I reached out to my point of contact, which is a separate team that we&#39;ve been negotiating with.
And the same day that this email came in, we were we were uhm discussing pricing with the other team and we were coming.
We came to an agreement on what the pricing should be. So that was the whole separate discussion. Let me show you what that.
So, uh. What that is, uhm. So I emailed them, asking them about this, without mentioning that it was forwarded to us from Jake.
And he, replied to me saying this was also a news to them this morning, they&#39;re trying to find out what happened.
And one of their finance person that&#39;s on this email, emailed me directly saying uh, well I like, I&#39;d like to have a meeting with you about this.
So yesterday I talked to him and he said he doesn&#39;t have much more details, which I&#39;m, I don&#39;t think he, I think he&#39;s not sharing it.
Um, and he said this is discussions that are happening above his level and right now they want, you know, they, they wanna, Chamberlain wants to reassess their technology.
And all of their technology, and ah figure out what they wanna do, whether it&#39;s, and, and they wanna look at other vendors and ah software development.
Um, but he doesn&#39;t have any other details as to what, why this decision was made. And, and ah, um, but he said the medical school and vet school, and all those contracts are, you know, they&#39;re very, you know, they don&#39;t wanna make any changes.
And they&#39;re, they&#39;re going to, they wanna renew that for July, and the fiscal year is ending, they wanna get that done ASAP.
So, um, my intuition, my intuition is telling me that there is something that, there&#39;s something brewing that is, that is gonna jeopardize our relationship with the Talim.
It&#39;s not clear to me what that is, because no one is really sharing much, and they&#39;re too big of an organization with too many siloed groups.
to uhm, get a right answer. And if we don&#39;t do something immediately, they may start looking into other products, and it&#39;s hard for us to change their uhm, their strategy.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e6635670ecfb421d80ed83bd27144f6a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Rebranding Design Update</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Zane, so this is a design that we have put together that is meant to rebrand ChatWebby using our colors and design style So the overall concept should still be the same the only thing that I think my colleague was tweaking up on these pages where he was trying to make these uh slightly more rounded

Then we have our case logger. It allows the students to log various cases. Then we throughout their training. Administrators would have set up templates with different requirements.
And I can use that to fill in details about any procedures I performed or any types of patients I saw with specific diagnosis.
If I&#39;m in my medical school or veterinary school, I can also see my curriculum. If I have to complete an evaluation, that ends up on my evaluations page.
Here I&#39;m able to open up a form and complete an evaluation on a faculty member or a colleague. Gradebook would give me more details.
About my rotation grades or my course grades. If the school is running a lottery for their schedules, that also gets served to the students on the lottery page where I can rank preferences for where I want to go go complete my rotations.
The requirements page allows me to see and submit various paperwork including drug screen, immunization records, BLS certification and this can be reviewed by the administrators and approved as part of the compliance requirements.
Resources page provides me with access to all the documents. that are required for various rotations, whether it be the goals and objectives for that rotation or site-specific requirements that I have to be aware of.
This is also emailed to me automatically before I start that rotation. Schedules page will give me a list of all the different rotations that I&#39;ve been scheduled to.
And this also allows me to request changes to that. So if I have an elective that I want to complete at a specific rotation, a specific hospital or clinic, I can submit a request and have the administrators review that and approve it.
And then scholarly activities, a place where I can centralize all my research, publications, uh presentations, so that this is in one place.
Administrators can run a report to see what the students have been participating in. So those are some of the core areas that the students can use the Metrix platform and have a centralized hub across their academic journey.

For the CCC report, many of our clients are running these reports every six months for all of their trainees.
To make it convenient for them, we want to add the ability to send these reports via email. And for them to be able to select multiple users at once.
So under the program admin portal, in the performance page on the CCC report, we&#39;re We&#39;re going to update the user selection here to, select to a multi-select field so that they can select multiple trainees at once.
And then at the bottom where it says download as PDF, we&#39;re going to replace that button with generate report. And then if multiple trainees are selected, that uhm we&#39;ll also add a description that says if multiple trainees are selected, the report will be generated and sent to you via email.
So if one individual is selected, we&#39;ll simply download the report. if multiple individuals are selected, we will show a suite alert that says reports for the individuals will be generated and emailed to you as pdfs and that and then they will be able to click an ok to acknowledge that.
So essentially single reports it&#39;ll download immediately if it&#39;s multiple it&#39;ll be emailed as separate pdfs</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0292fcaa591e4aa9825bb940a16f2593</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Platform Enhancement 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Zane, how you doing? I want to share this video to explain a couple things on um a couple of concepts.
So this is a uh metrics platform that we we have provided to our clients and it&#39;s sold to different hospitals and medical schools and when they have different departments using it.
They can add users for each of those departments and those users have different profiles that they can use to manage their data.
Um, so taking that, uh ignore this for now, this is a, something that I was working on for the the main home page.
Uh, but if we look here, what I was hoping that we can do was have a second layer of administration where Metrix employees, we can create a new client.
They would have an institution name and the name of the person that we&#39;re adding. And I guess here I&#39;m keeping it simple as one administrator is a client portal in reality they may have more than one so if we had let&#39;s say medical school x and then you may have a bunch of administrators that would manage
medical school x and those individuals would have access to this client portal where they can create additional individual users manually or a csva import that I put here so that it can if you have a large number of users they can do it in batch it&#39;s not critical um and then deactivate and delete users
um ability to import so right now we have a chat bot that you can create you can add a bunch of data sources to it it would be cool if I&#39;m creating another chat bot and I want it to use the same data source I can choose another one and say just copy it over from that instead of having to upload it again
and also for our clients they would like to ideally have control over who uses it so if they are creating a chat bot being able to say we&#39;re going to add some of these users that we enter and add them to the chat bot and once they publish it um it&#39;ll be available to them and they should also be able
to monitor the chat bots and what people have used it for in logs and on the individual user portal use chat bots they have access to and then being able to interact with it either voice or text voice, uh, I&#39;m not sure and again, if it&#39;s already implemented and it&#39;s easy to do we can, we can do it, otherwise
we can keep it as text and then do this as like a future quote uhm, API, again, secondary, uhm, ideally in the future if we have a client that&#39;s using our platform and they want to add this on, it&#39;d be nice if we can use our API to create this and add all the users.
So I wanted to send this over to you and get your thoughts on this. Uhm? On the complexity of it.
And if, uh. If it makes more sense for us to pick out. Uh, you know, maybe do some some of this and then do the rest as a second version.
Uhm, it all depends on. How much time it would take essentially the cost of it. Alright, uhm. Yeah, that&#39;s all I had right now.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cca4f3f009f94119bdfc3418f30c9e88</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Funding Opportunities for Expansion 💸</pre></td><td><pre>I keep creating these videos to share some more of these projects that&#39;s been sitting around on my inbox or to-do list.
So we started a conversation with Capchase. last year and it didn&#39;t uh progress to anything but we got pretty far and they felt confident that they are able to give us money and uhm there was something that we needed to fill out and it.
It was a time where there was a lot going on and we never moved forward. But I&#39;d like us to pick up this conversation now especially since we have these big renewals coming in and one of the things that they like to look at is our bank statements from the past few months and seeing that we have cash.
It&#39;s a lot easier for us to get this approved when we have money, uhm, and the nice thing about it is it&#39;s non-dilutive and it&#39;s built for SaaS.
So if we can either get a line of credit or some sort of capital while we have money in the bank, then it gives us some more buffer.
We already have a 100k line of credit from O***** and then this would be something that can expand on that.
What I like to do is if we get something that is reasonable, uhm, we can use that to hire a uhm, the next person which is going to be a CTO.
Uhm, so that we have someone in Philadelphia that is able to close some of the technical gaps that we have.
Anyway, uhm, what I will do is when you&#39;re ready, I can send an email introduction with the person that we were working with.
and we&#39;ll see how we can get that conversation going and in terms of what they need.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/403bf3c32f074920a8bc1df65ba25c2a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>App Design Presentation</pre></td><td><pre>design that&#39;s not meant to be the entire design but I wanted to put together the general style and the, the colors and it should be pretty much the exact same app, uh we didn&#39;t do the admin side, but I said uhm, but we wanna match the branding, uhm, and then also playing in the background there.
Uhm, but this is the landing page where we can, you can add chatbots, train it, and then see the content that was added.
And this is the desktop version. As well as the mobile responsive view. This particular page, the metrics AI page. I&#39;m going to work with Mike on a slightly modified version so we can do this last.
The idea here is, uhm. What I&#39;m going to have is two tabs so that there&#39;s two major segments of our customers that we that we want to talk to and they can pick one or the other and it will give them three use case scenarios here.
Let me see if I can pull something up here. I was sketching this on my iPad. That&#39;s why it looks horrible here, but you can see there&#39;s the education, there&#39;s clinical practice, and then there&#39;s uh screenshot and some notes I know you, you can, you probably can&#39;t read all this handwriting.
It&#39;s scribble, and I have a my uh, my iPad handwriting. My handwriting is horrible, but you&#39;ll see the, you&#39;ll see the concepts.

We recently switched over from a law firm to Kozen, and Kozen has an engagement letter with us.
And I reached out to our lawyer there, Chris, and we had a meeting and we talked about some legal work that we need to have done.
First is, um, we have some contracts with our employees and contract, and contractors that we want to have them review and update.
For example, Well, we recently started doing W-2 employee training. We&#39;re still using an older offer letter. I want to have them review it and make sure we&#39;re all good to go on the, uh, all the, uh, details in there.
Um, so this lady is trying to schedule a call with us to get that process started. I want to connect you with them and maybe we, we can do the initial call together and then, uh, you can work with, with, uh, her to see what updates we need to have done.
That&#39;s the first phase. Second phase is for us to, uh, do some cleanup on our SaaS agreement, since that&#39;s a little outdated too.
For example, we are now providing AI functionality. I want to make sure that we include things in there that cover that type of, uh, data exchange.
So that&#39;s something that we&#39;ll do as phase two. Um, but working with the law firm to get these things updated, um, and also doing it in a way that we can do it over time, so we&#39;re not getting slammed with large bills, um.
That&#39;s one of the projects that I wanted to, uh, get you involved with. Once, uh, you get settled along that same type of work, we have this company called uh, Exaltus.
Robert is an employee of Atalem. He reached out to us saying that he has a private company. It&#39;s a consulting company, and they are, they started recently, and they are working with different medical schools, and they want to get us sales leads.
And he sent over an agreement on uhm, what they would like us to give them as commission for providing us with this lead.
I didn&#39;t want to engage in anything like anything immediately, and I want to make sure that we have a lawyer look at it.
So I forwarded it to Chris at Kozen. He, he looked at it and said, I don&#39;t like this agreement. This is too one-sided for them.
And he sent me their agreement, uh, or their Kozen standard agreement, and uh, it&#39;s still sitting in my email. What I need to do is meet with Chris, go over it, and then we send it to Robert saying, in order for us to start this partnership, one, we want to use this agreement, and two, we need to make
sure that we talk to the Talim, and make sure they&#39;re okay with us working directly with you for getting us legal.
Uhm, so that&#39;s a secondary project, uhm, and uhm, the first step is for us to talk to Chris at COSEN to figure out what exactly he wants us to explain to Robert.
So I&#39;ll put this on the document and we can talk more about it and figure out a way to move forward.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/152198eb92584914b3d8e78385dde29e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Organizing Notes After the Call</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Silvana, I wanted to create a quick video on how we can start organizing these notes after the call. So, under discovery notes in the sales folder, we want to start, ideally we want to start just before the call so we have it ready with some the draft presentation, but we can say this is going to
be a new folder, give the name of the institution. Inside of that folder, if you go to docs from a template, uhm, we have.
This template that we can put in and it&#39;s called process documentation and we can put in the details of the meeting, who was there and then for the appropriate section.
So in this particular example, it was clinical education management, um put in the the current challenges they have and the, see let me take that back.
I think we can do a slightly different format here to make it easier. I&#39;m going call this uh Virginia Tech.
What we can do is um, first thing is going into Adam. Open this up and copy the transcript. And uh, start a new document.
And paste. Paste that in here. So now we have the transcript. I can take this and go to Claude. Paste this here.
transcript for a school. List out each of the challenges. So that would be one of the. Things that we want to prepare.
And the second item is uhm. I also want to get a list of all the questions that were asked. And we want to, uhm.
We want to make sure that this is accurate. So for example, this is for some reason saying E value. They actually are on 145.
And that&#39;s that&#39;s the first one. And then. And then the second one is for these lists of questions. And for the questions, uhm.
We can put this as. I&#39;ll show you. What we&#39;re trying to get at, essentially what we&#39;re going to do is challenges, solutions that we&#39;re offering.
All right, and then. And at the bottom, we can put together a list of questions she asked, and what we answered.
So that essentially one document that we can send to her as a meeting summary, as a PDF attachment. This way she&#39;s, she has the information in a written form.
that she can share internally if she needs to. For this particular person, it&#39;s not a big deal. She&#39;s only one person that&#39;s making the decision, but for other schools, maybe they need to go to a committee.
So, getting the transcript, um, running it through CLAWD, preparing a summary, and reviewing to make sure that there are no mistakes, um, that the AI made, and then drafting a thank you email with that document.
Um, and we can use this as a practice session, and I can, I can review that, um, whenever you&#39;re ready.
No rush on this. It&#39;s not a big deal if we send it to you in a couple of days.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1ca2b307588e4c919b4c69313e3be45a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Employee Handbook: Expectations for Communication and Availability</pre></td><td><pre>This is going to be a employee handbook section. It&#39;s going to talk about the expectations for communication when there are changes to the availability.
At Metrics, we will be using a spreadsheet to track changes to the availability. Um, each team member is expected to be working from their home or off, or Metrics office.
Um, so by the When it comes to, um, availability changes, if an individual, every Friday, each team member is expected to update the changes to the availability on a spreadsheet.
This gives everybody the flexibility to work to There are no changes to your availability. For example, if you&#39;re expected to be working from your home and you&#39;ll be at home for the whole week, you don&#39;t need to make any updates to this spreadsheet.
If you&#39;re expected to be at the office for three days out of the week and you&#39;re. not expecting any changes, that will be, you don&#39;t need to make any changes.
However, if one of those days, if you have to work from a different location, you can use the off location status and type right in where you&#39;ll be working from. If you&#39;re not need to run an errand during the week or go to the doctor&#39;s office, you can choose the alt hours option and write in where you&#39;ll
be, what hours you&#39;ll be working. If you&#39;re going to be taking a day off, that needs to be submitted in advance.
So, I&#39;ll Justworks and it will be, you can update it as PTO on the spreadsheet. After everything is submitted, on Monday, the availability will be shared with the team by Alejandra.
If there are last-minute changes, there are two options that can be used. If you&#39;re sick, communicate that with Alejandra and she will update the sheet with sick status and communicate that with the team.
If there are last-minute- changes to the availability, umm, because the location or hours that needs to be submitted as an emergency into the spreadsheet.
This way, umm You know, we are building a process by which there&#39;s an expectation that we&#39;re giving advanced notice and being accountable to that, to the team, if there are any changes.
It has to be because you&#39;re sick, or it&#39;s an emergency. We want to avoid last minute changes simply because you don&#39;t, uh the last minute changes because it&#39;s.

Our conversation today about sales and renewals got me thinking about some of the work that we&#39;ve been doing with our sales meetings to try to streamline our processes.
I wanted to create this video outlining the uh the existing slash newer process and for sales and also how it ties to onboarding and customer success.
And for the latter part, the uh the customer success part, you can make, you can work with uh Mark, Alejandro, and Silvana to optimize that and change whatever you think would be best.
I want to share this information so you have visibility into what&#39;s currently being done. Since a lot of that has been initiated, by me, I would like that to be initiated by the team members and for us to build some sort of reporting process or dashboard or tracking that you can monitor to make sure
that it&#39;s getting done. That&#39;s for the other, the second half of this. So, currently, when we start this whole customer journey, we have leads coming in from the website where they can complete a form and that&#39;ll give us an email that says this person wants to be contacted.
It includes a phone number and email address. After they submit the form, they&#39;re also presented with a cantilever. It&#39;s a page where they can schedule a meeting with us and it shows up on my calendar.
Some people schedule it, some people don&#39;t. Another way we can get a general lead is if they email the hello at metrics lab, we can also get a referral directly to one of our email addresses.
We collect conference leads through Google Forms. You can also get messages through LinkedIn or generate leads through webinars. Regardless of how it comes in, this is the process that I&#39;m working towards now that we have Sylvana as an SDR.
So if you&#39;re interested in working please feel or not this person has scheduled a meeting or not. If they did not schedule the call she would add the lead to close, add the opportunity, and so on.
If she, and they would also she would also attempt to call them and email them. If they did, did schedule the call they would, she would lead, she would add the lead to close, add the opportunity, call the prospect, and go through a different set of steps because at this point we&#39;re trying to get the
agenda and ask questions rather than trying to schedule the call. Anyway, uhm, so that&#39;s the first step. Once the meeting is scheduled.
Silvana would update the opportunity status, set the agenda, send a reminder with the agenda the day before, prepare some documents for me, and also give me some information before the meeting so that I&#39;m going in prepared.
I would run, I would do the sales presentation. with PJ and Silvana on the call. After the meeting, Silvana would update the status and send a, sorry, this is actually prepping for the consultation, uhm, again, so I&#39;m going to delete this because I have an unprepared notes for what happens during the
consultation. Post-consultation summary sent and if they need a proposal, PJ would start preparing the proposal, he would review it with me, add the proposal to the contracts document and and share it with them.
If the institution doesn&#39;t support the proposal, PJ it with me, add the proposal to document, In the sales channel, I would ask Alejandro to start drafting a contract.
She would get the proposal from PJ. She would create the new uh contract. And I have a Google template. So if you&#39;re in the Google uh document, there&#39;s a template.
Essentially. Please go to new documents from a template. And you can see we have this. is SaaS agreement template right here that have certain fields highlighted in yellow and Alejandro would fill that out.
And once it&#39;s filled out, she would also generate an invoice if she needs to create. She would a new customer.
She would prepare that in QuickBooks. Then she would share the invoice and the draft in the sales channel. Once it&#39;s all reviewed, she would send it.
And using an email template that I provided her with. And then she would follow up until it is signed and paid.
So this. Once. That is done. If they sign the contract there will be a handoff between me and Katie where I would outline the things that we need to set up.
Katie would create a new project in Slack. Set up the new arrows project and then get everybody. Scheduled for the kickoff.
Then we go through the onboarding phase with weekly meetings. Let&#39;s hear. And once onboarding is done. I have prepared. An email template that Katie is going to start using to introduce Mark as the customer success lead.
And explaining what he&#39;ll be doing, access to the uh resources and so on. So that is the handoff that happens here between onboarding and customer success.
And the goal is for Mark to then pick up that conversation and start a series of- quarterly check-ins. And he needs to put those check-ins on the calendar right away instead of having to schedule one every quarter.
Essentially he would tell the client that we&#39;re gonna put this recurring meeting on the calendar if we need to move anything we can later on.
But we- we don&#39;t have to uhm contact each other every quarter and try to put that on the calendar. So most clients will agree to that right away if they&#39;re already going through the onboarding process.
Um and there are some steps I&#39;m skipping here such as onboarding survey and things like that. I wanna uh. I&#39;ll see focus a little bit more time on this check-in and expansion here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/51e0cf3450e44156aa2bd3f0a5df4d81</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Quick Tips for Organizing Notes After a Call</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Silvana, I wanted to create a quick video on how we can start organizing these notes after the call.

How exactly does your platform work? Sounds interesting. How&#39;s it different from just using spreadsheets or project management tools? Does it integrate with other systems?
Systems we might be using? That integration piece s- sounds useful. What&#39;s the time commitment for managers to set this up and keep it running?
And how much does it cost? Probably a couple mainly in meetings and emails, but it&#39;s not very efficient. What&#39;s the ballpark cost for your system?

I wanted to create this short video explaining my thoughts because I figured it&#39;s easier for me to describe it than to type it out.
You made three points here. Uh one is about the camera, the other one was about the clients leaving and how to, how do we figure out why they left and then in the future how do we make this so that we are managing the bugs more efficiently.
So, so that&#39;s for the first item. The reason. I&#39;ve been emphasizing the camera so much on meetings is because as a small team working remotely, everyone&#39;s perception of work and each other is made up from those limited- interactions we have with each other.
You know we have a few hours a week to influence how others perceive us because you know many of them make their impressions about each other from those interactions on calls.
And umm ask for a small team like us when new team members are joining and they&#39;re seeing that not everyone is coming prepared to meetings or even if they&#39;re prepared they&#39;re not don&#39;t have the camera on.
They can&#39;t interact with them like they would in a face-to-face meeting. They start to also decrease their amount of interactions and also start to perceive others on the team.
I was coming unprepared. Even though that individual may be uh uh uh uh late to a meeting or aren&#39;t prepared or uh doesn&#39;t have the camera on because of doing a bunch of other work.
Uh late into the night. But across the company, not everyone has uh insight into that. I can see what everyone&#39;s doing, but others on the team can only see what they see in these meetings.
So each person is building a brand essentially. Your colleagues and others are um always looking at you and saying okay this is a person that I want to uh uh work with.
I want to uh you know this person is a leader, this person uh someone I can rely on. And then those meetings allow you to build that brand so that you&#39;re always seen as uh you&#39;re always seen as a leader in the company because that&#39;s what you will become as the company grows as more people join.
point. Then the other part of it is it also projects a lot of confidence when you are having the camera on because not a lot of people are comfortable with the idea of doing it and then when you always present yourself that way it uh by default people see you as a confident person.
Umm, so confidence and building your brand so that people are also modeling your behavior is one of the main reasons I keep emphasizing the uh the camera.
For the clients that left the second item we have four clients that I met, uh I mentioned it. Kaiser, TCC ADA, Texas DHS, and Ultimet.
Kaiser, we know that it&#39;s related to bugs, some of the workarounds and things they have to do as well as training challenges.
And we are tackling that. Umm, and we have a plan for them. Ultimed, we still don&#39;t have an idea of why they left.
I&#39;m going to be following up and trying to get that information. Um, that&#39;s one client that I was surprised by.
PCCA DA, they left because they were merging with another hospital and they couldn&#39;t use another system. They had to use a big hospital system.
They had no control over that. And then for the uh Texas DHS, I don&#39;t know why they left either, but it was one of our smaller clients.
I know that we haven&#39;t been paying as close attention to them and uh it possible that they weren&#39;t using the platform.
And it may not be related to bugs. Uh but I&#39;m still also trying to get more information on that. So as far as, I notice like why they left.
I see two major buckets. One is umm bugs and stability. Second one is the training and making sure that clients know how to use the platform.
So we kind of neglected that a little bit in the past year after we left. We lost a couple of people but we&#39;re picking that up with our webinars that we&#39;re hosting as well as the content we&#39;re creating.
And then for the third item of how do we get bugs handled better. I agree that as the team grows we need to make sure that we have more support.
For handling bugs. I&#39;m optimistic that as we move towards this single page application it&#39;ll make it easier for us to handle these bugs.
The challenge right now is we don&#39;t have enough people and we don&#39;t have the capital to hire a bunch of developers at once.
It&#39;s a tight balance that we had to operate on as a bootstrap company. We can potentially raise money from our venture capitalists and then hire more people.
The challenge with going the end route is we lose control over what we can do with the company and what we can do with umm a pay.
You know I see us if we can continue to grow using revenue as the company grows, we can use that capital to pay people more and for us to have a good way to control the culture of the company.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/92e40748a9444880a8945a163b208105</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 May 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning Karen. I hope you&#39;re doing well. I wanted to create this short video because I figured it&#39;s easier for me to explain this rather than type everything out.
You make some great points here, So let&#39;s go through this one by one. So there are three things you mentioned.
One is related to the you know the morning discussion I had about cameras. Another one is about the the clients leaving and why they left.
And then the third thing is about the the future of how we handle bugs. So for the first thing. When it comes to the camera, one of the reasons I&#39;ve been making an emphasis on that is because as a small team is working mostly on a remote environment.
We have limited opportunities to influence how others perceive us. You know, office environment, you&#39;re seeing each other all the time.
They get to know you really well. They see the work that you&#39;re doing. In a remote environment, very limited people will have insight into the work that each of us are doing.
I for example, see across the company. And see what everybody&#39;s doing. You know, you know, I see certain individuals like yourself and Maria working late night and doing work.
Um, after hours because you are you may be more productive in that. I&#39;m like that too. What happens is in the morning when other team members show up for these meetings when uh, the individuals that were up late working, um.
When they show up for the meeting, if they don&#39;t have the cameras on because they were up late and exhausted.
They&#39;re proceed by others as someone that&#39;s not prepared for the meeting for whatever reason. They don&#39;t know that what was happening overnight or late night.
Um, so their perception is there are some people on the camera and joining the meeting that are. Unprepared while I&#39;m got up and got ready for the meeting.
Um, and then what happens is over time when that consistently happens, those individuals, especially when they&#39;re new to the team, say this is the baseline for how this company operates and this is an.
The perception of those individuals also, um, deteriorate. So what happens, what&#39;s the best way to handle that is, you know, trying to come up with a consistent schedule around the meetings that you have.
So that you&#39;re always, you know, showing up prepared and I mean you, I mean all of us.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ec9151b4ef70417eafae51368de2f34c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Video Feedback on Marketing Presentation</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen, uhm for this uh we had a chance to quick briefly check this out in the marketing meeting. A couple things that we want to address here for the subscribes.
Fixing that typo there. And then for the images here, it looks great. And it looks like I can click on it and go to that profile.
It&#39;d be good if we can also do that down here. Make it clickable. And as for these features, and clinical, the colors, the orange one looks great.
For the blue, uhm, I think it&#39;s fine. I was wondering if there&#39;s an existing color that we can use, but I think it&#39;s fine to make that unique.
But let&#39;s match that with what we have here, so that the feature in the clinical is something that looks similar to the previous page, you know, the rounding of the corners, making sure that&#39;s consistent in the colors.
And we also want to make this clickable here and here. So that we go to the page with all the features.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b9aec3e6db8f4545b0e18fe207d1c556</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Data Monitoring and Alert System Implementation</pre></td><td><pre>We started working on this a couple of years ago. We, it was always hidden because we never finished it, and then Karen finished it, and we released it yesterday.
So on any server, if you go to the institutional portal, there is this engagement panel. And here, um, there are a bunch of different thresh, uh, criteria that we can monitor, and it&#39;s broken down by module.
So these are the different training programs they have. So let&#39;s, let&#39;s show you something like msu-com, g-c-l-m-u-e-com, make it ucc. So we just finished on, we finished onboarding them.
So let&#39;s say if I go in here and go to institutional portal, engagement panel, okay that&#39;s not good. Looks like we have permission zone in it.
I&#39;m going to go back to demo and show you there. So. Probably a bug that we need to fix there.
But any any of these um criteria of users that have never logged in. I can go in here and set a threshold that says for you know if it&#39;s greater than five.
So we obviously want to have every user that&#39;s logged that&#39;s created have been logged in at least once right. So probably put set this as one uh zero or greater than equal to one.
Uhm in the past x days, ten days, that&#39;s a threshold and if it does hit that threshold then it&#39;s going to start logging alerts.
But the cool thing here is we actually have a slack integration. And it will send us alerts from each of our servers.
Telling us that client data has been breached. So we can set this up on different clients and it will automatically notify us on slack when something is breached.
So we had to, what we had to do next is looking through these different criteria. and figure out what&#39;s meaningful for us to monitor.
So users not invited. So we can set up a threshold like um greater than let&#39;s say zero in the past 60 days.
So this means that in the past two months there are some users that were created but never invited. So someone may not know how to invite users.
Or they don&#39;t know that they need to. So for now what I&#39;m going to ask Mark to do is set up a few of these uhm or at least create let&#39;s we can start with a spreadsheet where we decide what is the criteria that we want to monitor and what&#39;s the threshold and then possibly create a script that we populate
that to all of our clients and then automatically get alerts when things are happening. So here&#39;s another one where um automatic incomplete evaluations.
So if someone has um incomplete your value. You know, maybe it&#39;s not something that we need to monitor for every client, but there&#39;s some clients that are having a problem.
Customer success, we can say these people are not doing the evals on time for some reason. If it goes above, let&#39;s say a thousand for that client, then we can be alerted.
The first phase is reporting. For us to use it, but eventually what we want to do is show this to the client and say, hey, here&#39;s what you can use to monitor usage of metrics.
There&#39;s active documents, oh here&#39;s a super powerful one, active and expired. Uhm, so I wanted to show you this and also show it to Mark, maybe one of the customer success meetings, you and him can talk through, Mark can do the first pull out of all these into a spreadsheet and pick and mark off the
ones that we should monitor and what the expected the test threshold will be and then maybe you can do that.
Both of you can talk through it and come up with that criteria and then we can ask Marina or someone to write a script that puts that as a default for all the servers.
This would be for clients after the onboarding process because we want to make sure we wouldn&#39;t use this for that.
Because we want to be more hands on. Exactly. Okay, so once. This is going to be for customer success to monitor um engagement with our platform and eventually we can even integrate this with intercom so that if it drops below a certain I mean hits a threshold it triggers an email saying here&#39;s instructions
on how you can invite people so that&#39;s that&#39;s really what the where this can go in the future because any data and metrics can be used to trigger emails and we&#39;ve built a template for each of these scenarios that we&#39;re monitoring with instructions to address it then hopefully that&#39;s something that happens
automatically even without our internet us meeting with them. This will be good for the new academic year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. That&#39;s really good.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ee1c3a36570d472a8dec437233dbe825</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Evaluation Form Restructuring Recommendations</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning. In this video we&#39;ll take a look at the evaluation forms that you have shared and our recommendation for how we can restructure this in metrics.
So this form here, overall student performance evaluation by faculty, fourth-year students, we have two sets of questions here, and for this we&#39;re seeing each question has a essentially a checklist of how this was observed and a percentage.
And at the top we also have a scale here, two scales, superior, acceptable, and unacceptable in this is also a letter grade.
So this is too much for the faculty to process, it&#39;d be better if we can simplify this so that they can quickly run through this and provide their feedback and then behind the scenes you can manipulate the data to get a grade.
So if we look at that in metrics, one recommendation here is, you know, let&#39;s put a question right at the top that says how, what is the primary method of observation, you know, we can rename this however we see, see fit, but essentially this is giving them an opportunity to say what&#39;s the, uh, what
is the primary method that I use. I may have seen them in direct observation, and I may have seen them writing notes, but this is the primary method I use.
So that&#39;s one way for us to structure this. We can also turn this into a checklist question where we give the faculty an option to pick more than one.
They can say, I did this, and I did this. But we&#39;re only asking this question once instead of asking them to select it for every single clinical skill.
And then here, for each clinical skill, what I did was I turned this into a a scale that only has three options.
Above academic, superior to academic level, acceptable for academic level, or unacceptable. And then we can assign different values to this, so three, two, one.
one, and then use these values to calculate a grade. This also translates really well to mobile, so they can easily answer this on a phone and get you the responses that you need.
So that&#39;s for this tool. Here&#39;s the top section. And we can also put a comment field there for you to enter that.
The second part for professionalism, here&#39;s how we can do that is a uhm. Simple question with comply and do not comply.
And for each of these categories, we can put a title of altruism. And then And this allows the faculty to see this category is for altruism and choose one or two options do not comply or comply.
So that&#39;s our recommendation on how we can turn this into metrics forms. All of this is something that we can talk through and figure out if there&#39;s a better way to reword some of these questions and make it more.
user-friendly. But if we at least change the question options and simplify what the faculty has to select from you&#39;re gonna get a much better response and also mobile optimized means more uh higher compliance rate from the faculty.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/74a6d0fd3b1149aebc6fafa76447e238</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics and Competencies in Academic Training Programs</pre></td><td><pre>short video we&#39;ll take a look at how metrics allows academic programs to map evaluations to competencies or milestones and then we&#39;ll look at the report so that we can track competencies across an academic training program.
So, the first thing we&#39;ll see is, under evaluations, I go to templates. Any form that I have in the system, I can map to evaluation competencies.
So, create a new form. I&#39;ll call this end of clerkship feedback and then save and continue. When I create a question.
Whatever text question, this can be a Likert scale, multiple choice, text questions. These can be mapped to competencies or sub competencies.
And each of these can be. Import into the system, so depending on the schools competency set, we would import them, or if it&#39;s a national competencies or milestones.
That can also be loaded into the platform. So in this example, I&#39;m. Aligning this question with 123456 competencies. Then clicking save.
And it says right there 6 competencies and I can keep adding questions that are aligned with different competencies. Each form I create may have a different set of.
Uh, mappings and then the trainee is going to get evaluated in the preclinical and then the clinical setting and you&#39;re collecting data across those uhm longitudinal act, academic activities.
And if I go to the performance page, this provides us with a competency report. Thank you. The key thing to note here is that there&#39;s different ways to look at this information.
I&#39;m going to be covering one of the competency reports, but we also provide a PDF competency summary report that can be shared with any advisors.
There&#39;s also a polo graphs, but it&#39;s all the same information being displayed. in a different graphic. So now we can see all of the different competencies.
If I expand on it, I can see sub competencies and then I can see every question that is mapped to that sub competency.
It also gives me data on who submitted that evaluation. in what rotation it was, what date it was. On the right side I can see averages for this trainee, peer averages, and all of this information is rolled up to the sub competency average.
And here I can see longitudinal data and how this trainee may have progressed if I want to continue. I can these off and look at one sub competency at a time.
So this trainee was getting trending in the 2s and 3s initially and then towards the end of their training, they&#39;re progressing.
their advance into 3.5s and 4s. This applies to each of the sub competencies. You can see the trend that&#39;s going upward.
Now if I go to the competency graphs, choose a similar date range. It&#39;s going to take the same information and display it in a slightly different format.
we can see the competency data, the overall competency data, and then for each sub-competency. And this is for three years of data across various evaluations.
So this has been a summary of the competency mapping and reporting in Metrix.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b9c900c00e8146ae8fe15719371994d5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medical Education Software Inquiry</pre></td><td><pre>Hello, this is Agnes speaking.

Wanted to share this short video of going over some of these wonderful points that you&#39;ve made.
And figured it&#39;s easier than me typing everything out. So first thing. About the camera, the reason I make such a big deal about the camera is because people&#39;s perceptions of each other is very important in a small team like ours.
It helps mold everyone else&#39;s like work ethic and how they carry themselves. Because we all of us have limited opportunity to influence other people&#39;s perception of us in a remote environment.
We&#39;re only seeing each other in these meetings a few hours per week, as opposed to if we were in the office, we get to know each other really well and everybody sees all the great things that we&#39;re doing.
Otherwise, you know, I may be working late, you may be working late, and then in the morning, if we are all uhm, you know, showing up where the camera&#39;s off and some people are still in bed when they&#39;re making the calls, it makes it, it makes the other people on the team member that are morning people
and have different work, you know, they see it as like uhm. We have different people come in unprepared, even though they&#39;re not seeing all the work that happened overnight or late night, uhm it&#39;s, their perception is molded by those limited interactions they have with their colleagues.
And then what happens over time is, when we consistently having this pattern, everyone on the team slowly starts to show up, showing up unprepared, uhm, that&#39;s why it&#39;s, it&#39;s very important in a small team to make sure that we are always aware of ourselves and how others are perceiving us and then when
it comes to showing up for the morning meetings, you know, planning out so that we&#39;re always coming prepared and also, uhm, uh, fully alert. And, uh, I, and I, and I, know how difficult that is because I myself am a night person, but over the years I&#39;ve learned that people model my behavior.
So, if I&#39;m carrying myself and putting the effort to show up, then they also show up. As far as the why the client&#39;s left.
We do know um well when it comes to- Also the four clients, Kaiser is the main one. And they said they&#39;re gonna give us another, they&#39;re gonna reassess next year.
I&#39;m optimistic that we don&#39;t lose them. But for them, it&#39;s two things. Uh we had a meeting recently to review there.
Uhm, why they left. And we have a list of items that we wrote down. Bugs are one of them, but certainly training is another one.
And we&#39;re tackling that by having more of these webinars that they can join. And I&#39;m also gonna reach out to them.
What are doing more one-on-one training for programs that need it. As for Atala, not Atala, I&#39;m Ultimate and other one uh TCC ADA.
It&#39;s not related to But TCC ADA is not related to bugs. They were merging with another com- uh hospital and they were forced to switch.
Ultimate, we are waiting to hear back and text us DHS. I don&#39;t think they were using our platform for a while.
You and we didn&#39;t really follow up with them and have a chance to establish a good light of communication. And it&#39;s one of our smaller contracts and our attention went to all of our larger institutions.
Um, so the main one that I&#39;m still concerned with is about it&#39;s ultimate because that was a surprise to me, uh for Texas Tech, uh Texas DHS, it&#39;s more of like us getting into rhythm of communicating with these programs on a quarterly basis which more has been doing that now.
As for this last idea. of uh for bugs I agree that as we add more team members we need to sort of rotate who handles bugs so they&#39;re not getting overwhelmed.
Uh we used to do that with the team lead person that one person is responsible for that but the challenge right now is not everybody can handle all of the emergent bugs that comes up.
You know someone like Marina may be able to tackle anything uh but some of the other devs may not be as com- comfortable so it&#39;s as we add more team members we need to make sure that we have um enough devs that are on call so that or are available or rotating.
so that any type of bug can go to an individual um or we have one for one person for, for a night and one person for back and another one person for ops.
um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s all about us getting to a state where we can hire more. developers and I&#39;ve been thinking through this in a way that uh we&#39;ve always operated bootstrapped and growing from revenue and the advantage that we have there is it allows us to control our own destiny and and make sure that
as we make more money we can uh pay everybody more money and the company is able to um have more control over um our finances and what we do with it.
The other option is to raise capital from a VC. And then they typically end up making a lot of decisions on those uh items and control what we can do with our money.
Um so that&#39;s got sort of a tough balance right now. On one hand we want more devs with an easy solution that&#39;s for us to raise a bunch of money and how higher more devs.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dd5c9fad93d54e739ac8785f0b44a7ce</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Financial Document Analysis 📊</pre></td><td><pre>This video I&#39;m going to go over a few documents. This is our older budget document that a previous employee was maintaining and essentially from 2019 onwards.
How he maintained this is he has a list of all the clients and then he would put it here as blue when he when we plan to invoice them and then it would the payment would show up when they actually paid.
So essentially this is showing that invoice and then paid much later. So we&#39;ve been tracking it that way on this document and this stopped being used in end of 2022 when he left and then we started putting everything into Zenny.
This operating expense that shows you different subscriptions and you can ignore some of these columns. I think Rio was trying to do some analysis but essentially it&#39;s month by month how much was spent and how we maintained it was we would have a budget amount and after the month is over we would update
it with the actual numbers and um so that this this is the the budget will be there and for the future and for the past it&#39;s all um actual numbers numbers.
For people expenses, debt schedule, same idea here. So this is the older version And then we have the, The new version that&#39;s still in the works.
And one thing to note here. Is uhm Expenses This was never implemented This was a work in progress was to show what was the contract subscription and services for each year.
So that we can see growth. So this first column is showing lifetime value for each of the clients. And And then here.
For each client, we show the totals ARR and total services. And then at the bottom, you see the total and then the growth percentage.
So from 2021 to 2022, we had 40%. And uh, I don&#39;t think we ever finished filling out the 2023 ones.
I believe if we get out our data cleaned up, uhm, this will be easy to do in QuickBooks. So what I was doing in QuickBooks was we can create different types of budgets in here.
We never used this in the past. So profit and loss. And then what it&#39;s doing is pulling in all the chart of accounts and we can choose reference data.
So reference data here is 2023. And you can see we have these categories, sales, UME, GME, and then different types of services.
This is what we had a as any to clean up. So everything in here should be GME, UME, Nursing, Allied Health, and then VET.
VET we&#39;re gonna have it as separate. And then we have onboarding services, other services. And starting this year, we should also treat our optimizer and MSPE Maybe not the MSPE, but the optimizer as a separate service So that we can track how much money we&#39;re making from there Uhm, and then for the
cost uhm total income One thing that we always want to check when we come in here is All these categories as COGS Is under the right one So if we see, if we see something that&#39;s R&amp;D That means it was miscategorized by Xen So for example here, uhm Expenses I guess it&#39;s not grouping it correctly Well,
it&#39;s still pretty good. Uhm, if I hide empty rows, it cleans it up a little bit more. But what I was hoping that we can do is for the expenses we would have a category that is called GNA and then all the GNA items will be underneath that.
But either way, uhm, you can see it&#39;s showing the actuals for 2023 and it&#39;s putting in reference data based on that.
So what we can do is update this, say what are we going to estimate for 2023? I really like this because if we uhm use this to fill it out and whenever we get a new contract, we know that it&#39;s going to come in.
We know it&#39;s going to come in a certain month, we can update it in that month. And then next year&#39;s budget will reflect that.
Anywho, I guess we can also import a budget. So let&#39;s see if I save this, does it show up in Zany?
forecast. Okay, so it does. Alrighty, this is a great discovery. So, forecast. Wow. So, that&#39;s pretty cool. So, I I really like that functionality.
The only thing that uhm that you cannot do is go uhm in this pry platform Okay, I guess uh Can&#39;t use it right now The nice thing about this thing is that you can actually do hiring plans so we can say at the top top right, hiring plans, you can say in six months from now we want to add a CTO and what
the salary would be, benefits, like a percentage of that is benefits, and then that would get added to that budget.
And we can also apply. Models, so let&#39;s say if we have a new salesperson that we&#39;re going to add, we can say this salesperson is going to have an increase of 10 percent in our sales revenue, so for that year, and then maybe 30 percent the following year.
So we&#39;re basically saying each time we add a salesperson, this is going to be the impact on sales and all of the budget numbers will adjust based on that formula.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f86ff7f6db3e4251b5da755f2f79572d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Tips for Effective Communication in Negotiations</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, um PJ. I wanted to offer you this suggestion To help you come off even more Confident and effective because you&#39;re bringing up some really strong negotiation points during these calls and you know Complimenting what I&#39;m saying and also communicating in a very effective way there&#39;s one thing that
you can tweak that will make you come off even more confident in the points Drive those points home. So let&#39;s see If I can find Yeah, so like usually you make the statement, but towards the end you start laughing Which depending on the setting what the statement you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re it takes away
from that main point and also makes coming out You&#39;re doubting what you&#39;re saying at the end, but if you just make say the statement and let them pause Let them think about it and analyze it and I feel like it they&#39;ll It&#39;ll pocket pack a punch so for example here, there&#39;s also the potential of really
blowing the site visitor away And then just knowing their stuff. Yeah, so so right there like that&#39;s that&#39;s such a AI mapping is that such a strong statement that you made uh, but laughing at the end of that took away from You know, you know that impact, you know The potential really blowing the site
visitor away and your faculty knowing your stuff Um, so I think it it&#39;ll it&#39;ll come off uh stronger there if uh, you pause at the end without laughing um, and then There was another really strong thing that you said.
Um And again, these are you&#39;re doing great These are minor things that I you know, because I I want you to get better and better at this and so you can Do some of these uh negotiations, uh yourself And uh, that&#39;s the only reason i&#39;m pointing these out because you&#39;re you&#39;re saying things that deliver
that value So here this statement with everything you have going for you. Yeah, and and even along those lines like the the misery saving and stuff I mean, there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of reasons why turnover happens within an organization And with everything you have going for you It would be it would almost
be to to put it plainly like almost silly for one of those reasons still to be the platform that you&#39;re using yeah for sure So again, you&#39;re delivering like that is like such a great way to put it you you have a lot going for them and then it&#39;s almost silly that that would be the reason that they&#39;re
losing staff and I think just pausing there will will help deliver that drive that point home so I wanted to send that over to you again very minor stuff what you&#39;re saying is perfect I&#39;m giving tips to keep refining your your pitches there</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7f7041bd35ff462bbac8cc31a065dae3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Using ChatGPT for Process Documentation 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>Create this video to show you how We can use Chat GPT to craft process documentation, so when I&#39;m creating these loom videos what you can do is take the transcript, copy, put it in here, so what I&#39;m going to do is ah type in a prompt.
and then So, it&#39;s not always going to be perfect, but what we can do is give this, take this as a starting point.
We can even say output as a table, and export it, create a table. Anyway, it&#39;ll sometimes it gets errors, but I&#39;ll correct itself and that&#39;s one way to do it or you can say prepare a table using Markdown.
And then if I copy this and if we want to put this in Notion, for example, and let&#39;s say, all right.
Okay, we&#39;re all over the limit. I need to upgrade at some point. Let&#39;s see if I can do something here.
But let&#39;s skip that for now. But essentially, we can output it as a word, you can output it as a spreadsheet, you can also output it as this markdown, so you can copy and paste.
So that&#39;s typically how I use ChatGPT to generate these documents, but the key thing here is, we want to output it into a format and then review everything to make sure it&#39;s accurate.
So what I&#39;m going to do is keep creating these videos, it&#39;d be awesome if we start to put together uhm these documents.
documentations of the next time someone needs this, we have it ready for us to share with the team, whether it&#39;s a new team member that&#39;s onboarding or someone else that needs a reference document.
And I&#39;m going to get this notion upgraded so that we can put these there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/43d16576310345cf9d5c2216b2b7532d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Organizational Channel Overview 📊</pre></td><td><pre>this left side. I have it organized by categories. Projects which is for specific type of projects, onboarding projects are all grouped together, recurring meetings are here, and business team, development team.
This project called Curriculum Unify and Portfolio, these are development projects that we&#39;re creating a temporary channel, creating the conversations there, and then we&#39;re going to close it once that project is done.
This mobile app is also a development project. Then there&#39;s a recruitment one that started as a temporary project, likely going to turn into a regular business project, a business channel that we&#39;re going to use for all types of recruitment.
Once we get into the onboarding section here, you&#39;ll see that these are specific channels that we created for onboarding project that Katie&#39;s managing.
And then once the project is done, we will close it. It has Katie, myself, um Maria, and then myself. and other individuals like Mark or PJ if they need to be there.
A Talum discussion is actually not an onboarding project, but a channel that I set up specifically for a Talum so that we can use it to discuss all types of a Talum related issues.
I want us to, so I want to review these channels again so that I capture this in the transcript for documentation.
So projects category has curriculum unified project. Uh channel, portfolio project channel, mobile app channel, and the recruitment channel. The onboard category has a talent discussion, client onboarding, onboard LMU-DECOM, onboard UCC, onboard onboard CHICOM, and onboard mobile.
MyGuest. So MyGuest, uh CHICOM, and UCC, and LMU-DECOM are specific projects. MyGuest is already done, so we&#39;ll likely close that soon.
UCC is also done, so we&#39;ll likely close that soon. LMU and uh CHICOM are still going on. This client onboarding channel is more of a generic channel that we&#39;re using for uh planning out various uh projects, and we&#39;re trying to kick off a weekly meeting for this.
TALIM, like I mentioned, is mainly for all the TALIM conversations, and we want to make use of this more and more to make sure that we&#39;re discussing all the TALIM issues before we if we respond to it.
Down here, we have meeting channels. So this is a team stand-up that we have set up so that when the day starts, each team member is coming in and writing down what are the priorities for the day.
It&#39;s actually a quick stand-up and planning out the day. It hasn&#39;t been very effective because not a lot of people are using it.
I&#39;m going to consider restructuring it into a stand-up that is you&#39;re meeting with the team, but broken up into groups based on.
What, what different types of business, so developers have their own, maybe customer-facing team members have one, and then the sales and marketing team has another one.
But we can discuss that later. Then we have a client discussion. This is for, this is for any sort of client support question that comes up.
Content-workshop, this channel is for all the content team questions. Hot leads, I&#39;m going close this one. Because, we stopped using it, because we&#39;ve been using the sales channel.
Alright, coming down here. We have our other channels here, uhm Dream Team. This channel is for non business related discussions, sharing photos and things like that.
All of the different birthday wishes, anniversary wishes and things so on. Dev Channel is for discussing all development things. It&#39;s usually led by developers and they answer questions, ask and answer questions to each other.
Growth Ops is a, essentially our main conference room where we are talking about uhm whatever comes up. comes up with our US team members.
Sales, to discuss all things sales. UX, to discuss UX is design channel for discussing anything related to design, uh features we&#39;re designing.
Sentry Which is our tracking system for errors on the server. Plan Deploy Channel is what we use for planning out deployments of features.
Marina would kick this off, ask questions. Chris would answer questions and then eventually deploy that. Every Monday, every Monday we are deploying new features.
Bug Retro is a channel that automatically shows any bugs that was moved to. QA process and then the idea here is we use review this periodically.
And individuals are adding notes on how they fix the bug. Bug prioritization automatically posts all new bugs that were created and we&#39;re essentially using this to.
Make sure that. All new features are all new bugs are. Looked at and prioritize. They need to be done urgently.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a0611a63c6e645f3906932bbbc92a255</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Customer Health Meeting Recap and New Initiative</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, this is something that uh we talked about earlier this week in the customer health meeting, I think. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think you were there.
We wanted to, we&#39;re going to be starting a weekly one-hour session where Chris will be available for Kaiser administrators for their office.
And as an office hour where they can come in and ask any questions they want and get customized training. We&#39;re going to do this for a couple of, two months since the new academic year is starting and we want to make sure that they have a way to ask all these questions.
So I want to send this out via Zoom. Well, via intercom, but we want to include a Zoom links. So this is a draft email.
One thing that I wanted to find out from you is that if we can set up, this is not going to be a webinar, it will be a regular Zoom meeting that we have a link that they could join.
So they can ask whatever questions they want and it&#39;s less formal and it only it&#39;ll be only be going out to Kaiser program administrators One the question I have is if we create a recurring meeting on the calendar, is it going to have separate links or will it have one link that they can keep reusing
and then the uh the other thing is we want to also um send this out with the dates and I think we can also create a simple pdf that has the dates and the links so they can download and save it.
So it&#39;ll be weekly um and the time is going to be uh I gotta check to see what she what Michelle said um but I&#39;ll get that to you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d738681e7ace44f094971e3e0728a139</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Making Strong Points and Boosting Confidence</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, I wanted to share this note because I think you&#39;re making some really great points during these calls and there&#39;s one suggestion that I have that&#39;ll help you nail that, those points even more and come off even more confident.
Would I, so like I. You, you make this really strong statement and towards the end, um, uh, uh, you usually laugh which in some of the, I mean if it, if it is like a joke then it&#39;s okay but there in some points it, it takes away from that impact that you&#39;re making with the, uh, with the statement.
And, uh, makes it too light of a setting or makes you come off less confident about that point that you made.
Uh, I&#39;ll show you a couple of examples and I think, uh, you know, this is something that it&#39;ll, cause you&#39;re, you&#39;re making really great points and it&#39;ll make you, it&#39;ll, uh, allow you to negotiate more effectively.
If you simply say the statement and let them interpret it. I&#39;ll probably. And the other aspect of that is, is the reliability of it.
Of, if there&#39;s no, like, streamlined way for the data to go into the system through all those different things. Yeah.
Then even if the report&#39;s, like, really pretty. Yeah. You can&#39;t really trust it to, to help you. With your decisions.
Garbage in and garbage out, right? Exactly. But I&#39;m. This is. And that&#39;s also an added value of, uh, for, for students.
Getting that, that really clean, organized, and accurate, uh, MSP letter from you guys. Yeah.

I hope you had a great weekend. I figured it&#39;d be easier for me to record a short video going into some of these great points that you brought up.
when it comes to, for example, the meeting that I had the other day, I want- I wanted to emphasize a couple of things.
One is the culture aspect of it and how the camera plays a big role in that. Essentially, all of us only have a limited number of hours in a week.
where we have the ability to influence the team&#39;s perception of us. You know, unlike in an office environment where you see each other every day, in a virtual environment, people make their assumptions and And their image or their perception of you based on those limited interactions they have in these
meetings. From a company standpoint, we also have a challenge where those interactions also help mold the company&#39;s culture in those early stages.
So right now, we only have a few number of team members. As more team members come in, they look at what everyone else is doing and they build work ethic and work habits based on that.
The challenge with the remote teams, in a smaller teams, is that uhm, we want to always maintain the flexibility to work different hours.
But the thing is, so for example, uhm I know uh devs like you maybe working late hours and getting things done, and I see that, but for other team members that are on the calls, they don&#39;t necessarily see that.
And when they see you or one of the other devs on a meeting, that&#39;s the only opportunity they have to uh to come up with what uhm your brand essentially.
And each of you have a personal brand that you are developing with your colleagues and their perception of others on the team is made up on how they see you in those meetings.
Um, so I like to emphasize the camera because showing up on those meetings with those cameras, helps build your brand with the rest of the team and shows them an image that they see you as a leader.
And then as the company grows, they also have a higher um standard for their work, their work and how they communicate because they see others in the team doing the same thing.
Um, and it&#39;s challenging for, you know, for myself, for example, I&#39;m also in late night person. I like to work late, but when it comes to those meetings, I like to make sure that I&#39;m coming to those meetings uh, you know, with my camera on and prepared because I know that others are looking at me and
modeling my behavior. Um, so, that was the first thing, and uh, you know, it&#39;s not that hard. Bye.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/98923d6145bd4dba9d7166e468bd56f2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Tips for Delivering Strong Points in Calls</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, that was a great call and uh I was thinking while it was happening and I wanted to offer a tip.
You are delivering some very strong points during these calls and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s uh driving the point home in uhm uhm.
During the negotiations when we&#39;re saying certain things it&#39;ll you&#39;ll have a more impact on driving that point home uhm if you do one tweak here so sometimes you you make the point but then right at the end you&#39;re you&#39;re starting to laugh.
which uh uh takes away from that point and it it uh yeah it it makes you less confident about that point so i want to show you an example here okay and the other aspect of that is the reliability of it of if there&#39;s no like streamlined way for the data to go into the system through all those things then
even if the reports like really pretty yeah you can&#39;t really trust it to to help you with your decisions garbage in garbage out right exactly but i&#39;ve also listed like uh saving on time savings i think there are a lot of time savings that metrics it off yeah and and even along those lines like the the
misery saving and stuff um i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of reasons why turnover happens within an organization and with everything you have going for you it would be it would almost be to to put it plainly like almost silly for one of those reasons to be the platform that you&#39;re using yeah for sure

So, here. Here we can see uhm I&#39;m going to go over all of the different projects that we are working on.
I&#39;m going to start at the top here. I have it organized by uhm these categories. These are short term projects.
These are onboarding projects, meeting, recurring meeting channels, business team, development team. So this first project here is our curriculum project.
What we&#39;re doing is re-structuring our curriculum module. This is a project that August and Austin is reading, leading, and we&#39;re using this to discuss any questions that come up.
This is an upcoming project where Karen is going to, Karen R. Augustin is going to help refactor our portfolio pages.
because this one is actually something that I use a lot, so the chief of staff hiring process, and had Jerry, Katie, and Marcus give me feedback, and you know, essentially uhm, essentially this is something that we&#39;re going to use in the future.
Uhm, as we hire other team members, and I&#39;ll be adding you here, uhm, yeah, once we get started with that.
This channel, so now we&#39;re getting into the onboarding.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ab255732d2d14083bbea2f98aea301e5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of May 5, 2024 - 6 May 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen, hope you got a great weekend. Wanted to us record this short video to go over some of the great points that you made, figure to be easier than writing it all out.
So when it comes to those uh, Damirin that we had, I was a little frustrated and split deprived and uh, but the message that I wanted to get across to everyone was, umm, we are doing well in terms of growth.
We&#39;re getting large institutions to, consider us and we are one of the unique products in the market that can do, well probably the only platform that can do, umm, multiple types of medical education.
So kinda go through this one by one. When it comes to the camera, what I was uh, what I was uh, pointing at was each of us at this stage of the company.
You know when we are growing and there&#39;s only so many individuals in the team, eventually we&#39;ll end up becoming leaders in the company.
Because as more people join, they&#39;re going to be relying on the people that have been here to establish the foundation for which they build their careers.
So, each of us when we are showing up meetings and interacting with each other. Unlike in a fully in office environment, we all have limited opportunities to set basically build our brand.
You for example, I know that you are doing a ton of work late night. And after hours, because I see you online and I see a you know this is something that you have the,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/82145720f7ed4880b13e9113f30fe84c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 May 2024</pre></td><td><pre>wanted to uh go over this permissions for curriculum and some of the reporting so under curriculum setup if we go to Permissions.
we have the ability to specify which individuals that have full permissions over the curriculum so if i enable view or edit then whoever has that permission will be able to access the curriculum from their personal portal right now program admins have access if lisa is not a program admin and she&#39;s given
edit access from her personal portal she&#39;ll start to see curriculum on the left hand menu and then all of the different uh sections except for the setup she won&#39;t be able to manage the setup but everything else will be available that&#39;s one of the permissions second thing is course director permissions
so if someone is designated as course director which in the new build it&#39;s better if we rename that to uhm administrators or leaders, course leaders or course administrators because they&#39;re not always going to be director roles.
Anyone that is defined, for example here, Robert Chase is defined as the course director. That means he would have the ability to edit everything about that course.
And on his personal portal, you&#39;ll see a section called My Courses. And then inside of those course, he&#39;ll be able to modify the objectives, the sessions, and everything for that course.
You can also give them more granular permissions. That says, create, uhm, custom, custom keywords. If you disallow this, they can only select existing keywords.
They won&#39;t be able to create new ones. And then, this one, allows them to add, remove session, keywords from the sessions.
View profiles for the individual scheduled for the course. And then, case logs for the course. Which, is for anyone that is given courses.
Director, or of course, the new name, course administrator, or course leader, role. This session leaders, we can actually, get rid of this in the new build.
Because no one uses this, and we don&#39;t need to, make it. going forward. The other thing I want to point out here is, yesterday I mentioned, uh, being able to auto-generate the codes.
We have these session types here. What I want to do is add a field here called code, so lecture will have a code called lec, and then when we create session codes, it will automatically use the code.
Course code, session type code, and then add a number to it to indicate if it&#39;s the first lecture, second lecture, third lecture, and so on.
As for reporting, there are two areas that we want to review. One is, actually three areas. One is the search page, which allows the administrator to search the curriculum and get the data that they need and then export it to a PDF or a Word document.
I mean a PDF or Excel document. So if I come in here and search. It&#39;ll give me course objectives. So I can here search and then click view details.
It&#39;ll give me all the details about the course. I click expand here. It shows me my mapping data and then download this to a PDF file.
And here I can see data from the past academic year by switching to it. For keywords, I can do the same thing here.
Select different keywords. Search for it. And then it will give me a list keywords. I can click on it, view it, or I can download it to excel or pdf.
Same thing for content. That&#39;s one of the places you they&#39;re generating report using search. The second is on the reports page, there&#39;s a whole section called curriculum, and we have a bunch of reports associated with that.
Then, we have uhm whenever you have a student that is scheduled to a course on using groups, so you can see here that I have groups.
I have MS3 class of 2023 added to this course. If I log in as a student that is scheduled there, actually, let me clarify that here.
So you have that. You have them added to the course. This is saying that all of the third year students are taking this course.
If I go to sessions, if I select that particular course, and I have a session, click edit, you can see all the session details.
If I expand it, there&#39;s a section schedule here, and I can link uhm groups to that session, so it&#39;s saying, it, when you edit this, it&#39;s only gonna allow you to select groups that you have defined for the group.
You cannot select any group, only the ones that are on this group, and then if I put that student&#39;s group into this session, it&#39;s telling the system that that individual is taking this particular session.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a508c10fa87640c4b38a9ae2c9da5781</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Rocket Lane Platform 🚀</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon everyone. I want to sha- share this video to introduce uh Rocket Lane platform and go over how we- we will use this over the next couple of weeks to get everything set up.
So Rocket Lane will give you a overall project plan, which has several phases. Kickoff, general setup. System setup, clinical education management, and UAT testing, and go live.
So we&#39;ve added some instructions here. We&#39;re still setting up all of the- the uh tasks and videos. So if you look in here and if you&#39;re missing anything, it&#39;s beca- it&#39;s because we haven&#39;t finished adding all- everything.
So for example, Videos for creating custom roles. Those are things that we&#39;ll be adding soon. But feel free to work through any of these tasks and get them set up in Metrix.
Down here you can mark off things as they are done. So these are the subtasks that you need to be completed for learner and education management.
And here I also put in the different custom fields that you said you wanted to track in Metrix. So this video up here, creation of custom user demographic fields, will give you the instructions necessary to create those fields.
Then you can define these fields in the system and mark it off as completed. And down here you can also mark off the overall task when you have created all the custom fields for residents and preceptors.
There&#39;s a few different ways to look at this information. This is the timeline view, and then we have the list view, but it&#39;s all showing the same information.
When you open up one of these tasks, there&#39;s also a chat that you can do on the right side. If you have questions specifically about this particular task, it&#39;s best to use this, um, this comment here, so that way we can see the context when we are responding.
If it&#39;s general questions, there&#39;s a chat button here that you can use to ask general questions. And the all files page will show you any attachments that either team adds to the task, so that we have one central place to view all these.
So feel free to get started with these tasks, and over the next few days, we&#39;ll add more content here. And then next week, when we meet, we&#39;ll review the progress on where you are.
And if you get stuck anywhere, reach out, and we&#39;ll make sure that we provide you with additional instructions or help you troubleshoot that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7521173b5484428d8d653d3a4cf25962</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Testimonial Site Customization</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, here&#39;s the testimonial site. I subscribed to it so that we have the paid version so we can try it out properly.
And once you log in, you can go to dashboard. Open it up. Here&#39;s the two testimonials that came in. Edit space.
And here we have a lot of customization options like the text, uh text button text, consent display, um You want to modify this?
I don&#39;t think we need to say like social pages, maybe we can say something simpler, I gave permission to use this testimonial in uhm marketing material to other medical education, other academic institutions, without like saying social, depending on if it&#39;s a high hospital, sometimes when you hear the
word social, they&#39;re less likely to say yes, but if we, marketing materials to our academic institutions, we&#39;re saying the same thing but without using the word social media, uh text title, question label.
So yeah, if you want to modify it, so these are the extra settings and these are the main settings, you can also modify the questions.
So this is the general testimonial one. We could also create. A second space. That is specifically for. Or maybe not.
Oh, yeah, I got this one space. Um, I guess if we wanted to, we can upgrade to the $50 one.
If you want to have one space for, one space for uhm, general and another one specific for onboarding. If you want to have one specific for onboarding for Miagwest, we can modify this.
Yeah, and you can also modify to maybe have less questions. and just general instructions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/502c1935d58e4d5ba384c7d1f0bb0519</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Content Team Update 🎬</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Shruthi, so for this particular video I wanted to give you an overview of how our content team has been working.
We have a channel called Content Workshop and it has a few individuals in it, that is uh and all of us meet every Wednesday to go over different types of content that we&#39;re working on and especially the podcast that&#39;s been our main, main project but we are now starting to do other types of projects for
the blog. This particular one that I&#39;m doing right now is a script that Marcus wrote for me for me to record a video and share it with him so that he can use that in an email campaign to veterinary schools.
So what I did was I recorded it using V.io and did some quick edits to cut out all the fluff and what I&#39;m going to do is do is email Tim.
So Tim, Tim Doyle. is our video editor. He is on Slack. We often give him projects. He&#39;s, he works as a contractor through Upwork and he&#39;s been editing all of our videos for our MedEdge podcast.
But we, I also give him one-off video projects to help with. So this particular one I&#39;m gonna send him a file that I&#39;m going to upload to Marketing.
Let&#39;s add you here. Video Projects, and I put it in here. Upload to SPILE. Make sure that Tim has access.
Anyone with the link? Okay. So, I take this. CC Marcus. So, uh, essentially, for this particular project what I&#39;m trying to do is put my input and then having Marcus work with Tim and get this over to the finish line.
You don&#39;t need to get involved with this, but I wanted to show you some of the work that I&#39;m doing for marketing, um and how I&#39;m trying to leverage my voice or name in these campaigns so that it&#39;s coming from a physician, a CEO, but it&#39;s going to be managed by um Marcus or Tim.
Silvana and um what I want to do is as time goes on, try to create more of these videos that can be either be shared um via automatic emails that goes out, for example when we have a salesperson that requests a demo on the website.
We can have an email that goes out that introduces the product, and then they&#39;re coming in to the meeting with some uh, I think we mentioned, we talked about it recently when you were on on-site, and I also want to start creating um videos for LinkedIn to leverage the audience that I have and try to
get them to learn more about our product and possibly reach out for a demo.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fce5cfeb35284dc0bcc85fc42b1e2d64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Access Control at 1Password 🔒</pre></td><td><pre>So at 1Password we have ah the development vault, it has all of the servers that the developers have access to and all the tech uhm like for example development instances, is any servers that end with the domain .metrics.dev So all of our clients have client.metricslab.com They also have a staging instance
which is a clone of the production uhm called metrics.sg So it&#39;s kp would be, kp.metricslab.com is the production, kp.metrics.sg is the staging And then there&#39;s also a development instance.
The key thing with the development instance is that we have a script that wipes out any sensitive data so that it&#39;s obfuscated.
Nice. So all of our developers except for certain individuals only have access to the development databases and that has obfuscated data.
But Guy, Chris, Rio, Karen, I believe in Augustin, they have also have production data. So if certain things need to be tested with production data, our team in India cannot do it.
It has to be done by certain individuals. But when you come in here, if you&#39;re going to a server and it&#39;s .dev URL, all of those servers can be logged in using this password.
Okay. And then there&#39;s a bunch of other stuff here, but this is the main one that you wanna, you&#39;re gonna probably use.
So let me add you to this vault. Then we got, uh, this is one specific for, uhm, for uhm, Alejandra.
So she&#39;s you need to have certain accounts, but I didn&#39;t want to add every financial. So I&#39;m going to add you to here.
This has, uhm, some of the stuff needs to be cleaned out. Like, we just have been piling this up. But it has bank account information, credit card, so whenever we need to make a payment or something.
Like, instead of having to go look it up, I just use it in one password, so that it has all the details.
And then, anything that is financial related or like used for taxes and things like that goes into this one. And this one, let&#39;s see.
It&#39;s really only um, Chris and I that are using this, and now you guys and others, and Alejandro, uhm, we just happen to have access from the past, uhm, let&#39;s see what else we got, management, I don&#39;t know what this is.
sounds like something that needs to be cleaned up, but, I had to, so then. and then marketing, marketing, which is like some of the shared tools that we use.
JotForm, MailChimp, which also probably some old Operations, let me see, this is, this is actually development operations, not business operations This is, let&#39;s see Yeah, like anything like for our infrastructure I&#39;m giving you like basically access to everything that I have so you can do whatever I
need to do and then other I don&#39;t know what that is. Production instances. So the So the way that it works is uhm all of these passwords in the production instances and the dev instances that I showed you allows you to access to the, access the production instance.
company portal. That&#39;s the uh super user account and once you&#39;re in there you can go to the, you can do administrative stuff as a company user or you can go to the user&#39;s page and log in as one of their administrators without knowing their password.
Basically simulate. So if something goes wrong. Yeah. Uh, this one has support for customer support related. So yeah, so once you set it up.
You&#39;ll have access to everything and then it will be good with this. One more password is done. Slack is done.
Google app. And then, one path, just work you said you were working on. Yeah, I just need the password reset, I&#39;ll get it fixed.
And then, uhm.

I wanted to share this uh with you. I came across an opportunity for us to purchase um this product and business at a, um from a from a from the founder.
It&#39;s a platform that is used for um. Inter building a chat board that allows a person to interact with their data.
Um. We use something like this for through a call chat base. This is very similar to that where if I log in.
I can create a bot that contains various websites, PDFs and then I could go in here and. I can interact with it and ask questions.
And it&#39;s using open AI and a couple of other platforms. Uhm. And this is something that. Is a good opportunity for us because we can rebrand it and provide it to our customers.
Since. When it comes since there&#39;s a lot of consumer placing of products like this but for hospital and university environments there is no products that they can use by providing something like.
Like this through metrics we are going to allow them to use chat GPT and other tools in a more secure way.
And it&#39;s a really good opportunity for us because the. You know the person that built it he&#39;s a couple of other products that he&#39;s working on and he&#39;s trying to.
Um, sell it for five thousand dollars. And what I met with him this morning and you know it seems like a trustworthy person.
And then there&#39;s a whole process associated with buying it through a escrow service. Um, but what I would like you to do is spend a few minutes using the platform or and any problems or bugs.
Things that you find with it. If you can write that feedback here. Um, he said that if there&#39;s any issue.
We&#39;ll use it with it. They&#39;re gonna address all of it before they transfer it over to us. Um, so it would be good for us to fully test it and write down any feedback or questions before we make the commitment.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c2faadcc93174dbd842511bbfd85857d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Rotation Templates in Metrix</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video I&#39;m going to go over how to recreate this form in Metrix and you can create a second video for Aiden and Evan.
And we can make this in a way that we can reuse it in the future. So in Metrix, if we go into and turn off the Spanish setting.
Then go to admin portal, which is where they&#39;re going to be able to, they&#39;re going to have access to the admin portal.
And I&#39;m going to create a new template, and we&#39;re going to create this as a rotation template. So most of their forms are going to be rotation templates, because they&#39;re implementing Metrix for clinical purposes.
and clinical use is going to be using the rotation instead of a course. Classroom-based scheduling in the first two years is going to be using the course-based evaluations.
So if I go here and let&#39;s go to here, we&#39;ll give this the name. And for the description, take this.
And this section here does support some formatting. So if they wanted to be bold, they can highlight it and say capital B.
Not capital B, uh control B. And then skip activation date. Then for any time they have a form that&#39;s going to be submitted by a student, it&#39;s best to keep that as confidential, that way the school is protecting the identity of the student.
If it&#39;s an evaluation of a student, you want to make that non-confidential. We also have the ability to email alerts for a low score.
That&#39;s something that we don&#39;t need to set up immediately, but we can let them know that&#39;s a feature that&#39;s available.
Then we get to the next page. We can take this question, and we&#39;re going to add that there. I don&#39;t think it needs improvement.
So that will create a Likert question. And these items down here, they&#39;re not going to have it all listed out for each question.
So instead, we&#39;ll have one question at the top. We&#39;ll put that as a checklist. And for the values of this, we&#39;ll use uh zero, since they should not be used for grading.
And then we can show them how to move this up. And then there&#39;s also a way to say no feedback.
So if you want them to have a button, so if we go to preview, you can see that you&#39;ll see a no feedback option.
We don&#39;t need to include these fields at the top, because those will be automatically populated based on the schedule. We don&#39;t need the signature, because that&#39;s going to be collected.
And then for these items down here, what we want to do is uhm do something like this. You&#39;ll see that it retains the options for the previous question.
So if you&#39;re adding a whole bunch of these, one by, one after the one after another, it&#39;s easy to uh create them.
Do not comply. And this one has an NA question. I&#39;d like to put the lower option on the left side.
Zero. One. And then we can add a custom title. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have a way to put these descriptions in the middle of the form, so we would have to put that at the top.
as part of the description. So, you can put in as and that&#39;ll appear at the top. And then for comments.
Same thing here. Put it as text question. that over here. So that, those set of instructions will allow them to create uhm the forms that they need.
And they don&#39;t need to worry about the last part for now. This is the setting up the automation rules. You can inform them that we will set this up later.
For now, simply create the forms in the system.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a2dab0b5a9ca4d69bfe15b70de070b54</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 30 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So when it comes to check in the permissions, it&#39;s two places we want to review under the permissions here, we can check the student coordinators and confirm they don&#39;t have block schedule edit permissions.

Thank you. Put the actual block schedules itself. If there are um anyone that is granted individual block schedule access. So if you can see here, student coordinator is the test account and do it.
It was quick granted access. That will be shown here. Um. So student coordinator here would not show edit access for block schedule because they&#39;re not giving global access to all block schedules.

I also prepared this document that outlines all of their current agreements.
So let&#39;s start with, I&#39;ll start with reviewing the old or the current pricing, then I&#39;ll go into the the newly negotiated.
agreement. So this here, Ross University AUC, Ross University School of Medicine, which they sometimes refer to as RUSM, and the server for them is rsu.metrixlab.com.
And then American University of the Caribbean is AUC, and they refer to, I mean the server is auc.metrixlab.com. RossVet is RUSVM.
slash RUSVM.metrixlab.com. And then Chamberlain is broken up into these smaller programs, however, they&#39;re all on CUC. RUSVMetrixlab.com. So when we, the Ross University is our first contract with them and they are following a July through June academic year cycle.
Every residency program in the United States, they start on July 1st in the country. Medical schools typically follow their clinical schedules around that same time frame.
So this one is starting on July 1st. That&#39;s why a lot of our contracts start then. American University of the Caribbean, they started a little late, um so they&#39;re off cycle and they have this uh September start date.
The plan is for us to sync this up either this year or next year so that the all the contracts start July 1st.
I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to be able to do that this year given that we&#39;re already late. Um but we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna renew this one now, this one in a couple months and then Ross vet is also in uh September.
Chamberlain has separate contracts for each of them depending on when they started. AGNP is adult gerontology nurse practitioner program and this actually has two separate training programs.
There is the acute care and primary care track. And the invoice is one program and we have one contract for that.
That renews in September. PMH, the star is a July to June so we&#39;re gonna be doing that now. FNP, DNP is February so they renewed in February and the next one will be next.
Thanks February. This is two smaller programs that was added. I can&#39;t remember. I don&#39;t remember. It&#39;s probably less than a hundred trainees.
Uh it may have been part of this or BSN. Next year we have to probably put them with FNP, DNP renewal so that, It&#39;s not one tiny renewal.
We&#39;re gonna have to look into that. And then BSN, they paid last year, but it was paid in advance for a July 1st start date.
As we know, this is not gonna get onboarded. So next year, when we renew, uh renew, if they do decide to move forward with it, We&#39;ll likely have to give them 5% credit since they didn&#39;t use the licenses.
Um, and I&#39;ll explain that later. But all of the invoices are in this folder. And, I moved all the old ones into archive.
And I also started renaming these with the contract date. So let&#39;s ask ah um Alejandra to follow this naming structure.
Where it has the name of the institution. And the, The start date and end date of the contract. Otherwise we name them like this.
It&#39;s very hard to figure out what&#39;s what. So all of them are all of the current contract. I mean invoices are organized here.
And this one is something that Alejandra prepared for sending. For Chamberlain. I told her to hold off until we&#39;re done with all the negotiations.
So this is not going out yet and this actually is incorrect. So I&#39;m actually going to delete it because we have the new pricing model that&#39;s going to be kicking in.
And delete that for now. And this. This is . It likely has a invoice in QuickBooks that we&#39;ll have to remove.
Let me do that now. Or maybe not. I don&#39;t see it here. Okay so. Going down here. Next we get.
Thank I go into the newly negotiated pricing. So these prices were negotiated last August. We had many meetings with them about uh explaining how our pricing has gone up across all the schools and how they have.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4cdc82d4471042d2af3f5605620f0cfe</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Bug on Site Rotator Report</pre></td><td><pre>It looks like there&#39;s a bug on the site rotator report, where, let&#39;s see if I can find it. So site rotator report, it says.
Home institution. But it&#39;s actually showing. So the home institution is supposed to show the trainees home institution. But instead it&#39;s showing the site that it&#39;s linked to.
So we&#39;re simply repeating. What&#39;s on the site. So we need to correct that and show the home institution and the home institution code.
And here it looks like. Yeah, so this is also showing site, address, city, state, zip, country. Instead, we need to show.
the trainees home institution, home institution code, and the address for the home institution. Not the site for the rotation that&#39;s being shown here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3f402c6e1ee340da9472d528e3c25990</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Gradebook Interface Update 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Marina, so if you look at our gradebook, we have two tabs here. When we click on add score, it&#39;s supposed to let us add the grade for a course if you&#39;re on the course pay, course tab.
If you&#39;re on the rotation, it&#39;s supposed to let you add the rotation grade. We probably should. We don&#39;t two buttons or one for add course grade and add rotation grade, so when you click on this, the rotation works great.
You can select the rotation or manually enter it. But we don&#39;t have a way to enter a course grade because it still shows the rotation selector. If I choose a anatomy course down here, I should be given a drop down to pick the curriculum course.
So I created this design here. This I realized while I was making this video that there&#39;s a problem here. Really?
It really needs to be a simple. A simple drop down for the curriculum courses and the start date and end date and credits are always going to be on the curriculum course.
We don&#39;t need to give them the ability to change that here. Once they select it, we can simply show what the start date is, end date is, and the credits.
But we want that score to have a link to the GCR. And to the CCR, because the GCR is the parent that says this is an anatomy course, but the CCR is the scheduled course with the start date and end date that is for that semester.
So your anatomy is going to be offered in that semester, and um. It has a start date and end date, but we&#39;re using the GCR to indicate that it is the anatomy course, and every semester&#39;s anatomy course is going to be linked to the same GCR.
Let me know if that uh helps.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/876b637cfb4e433998ed99a75a6ed6d0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Report Challenges</pre></td><td><pre>So this report that we redid is extremely difficult to use when you have a place like Kaiser trying to select a large amount of ah uhm filters.
So let&#39;s say I got an email today from Kaiser saying they&#39;re having some challenges with this and I went they asked me to run a report for them and I ran it from July 1st till end of the end of the month and they wanted to select all the visiting roles.
So for me to do that, then I would come here. Select each of these one by one and as I&#39;m clicking, the screen is moving and making it annoying to keep adding these.
So in addition to clicking so many times, I also have to keep Deal. with this screen moving. And the other thing is, when I look at this, uhm, it&#39;s not easy for me to confirm whether I entered everything correctly because of the way that it&#39;s laid out where you have to look horizontally.
and vertically. If it was all lined up in, uhm, top to bottom, then I can easily confirm I&#39;ve got everything selected.
Same thing happens when I come in here and I have to select something like home institution. So if I select all, then I got this.
Long list that is, uhm, not good for the user experience. Same thing for all of these fields and another challenge is that in order for.
For me to generate these reports, I have to go in and select all these fields. It&#39;s probably best that we have all of the fields included by default and then they can unselect what they don&#39;t need.
And then once the report is generated, the Excel file has some columns that are, that should be capitalized or lowercase.
We can clean that up and make it look like, look more professional, since this report contains a lot of sensitive information that goes to senior leadership.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/56dd9e39affe44e59da3211fc9371d90</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;ve been playing around with this tool over the weekend and and and I love what we&#39;re doing here Especially how fast everything is and it&#39;s awesome and I&#39;m very excited about the next steps on this from what we&#39;re doing here I don&#39;t have any major feedback other than to for us to finish uh the things
so that we can keep moving forward in that direction but from a general UX standpoint for the how we cut.
we uh uh come uh uh come uh the components so that is standard I do have a few thoughts here one of the platforms that I&#39;ve been using recently is UX self which is a The thing that I&#39;m trying to get for all of our developers and team members to learn about UX.
It&#39;s a very well designed site has you know organized content that is clean and one of the things that I want to look here.
is to figure out what font hierarchy they&#39;re using. So that we can use the same thing in metrics because they&#39;re white space they&#39;re, Umm, sizes is very easy on the eye and very easy to find out.
Umm, very easy to find out exactly where you are in the system. So, you know, if we take a look at, their font sizes for here umm you know this is probably an H1.
And then you can see little check boxes and you know it&#39;s, iI think ao it&#39;s coming up with a check box that is something like this so it&#39;s easy to click and interact with and it makes it really umm use it friendly and then let&#39;s That&#39;s it.
I want if I want to do a job posting, text field, radio buttons that are I want to basically steal what their sizes are.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. It&#39;s like I want to one of us to go through this and kind of look at their f- forms and how they have built this so that we can use a similar interface for forms and the fonts in the system.
So, And one other comment here is, um, when we&#39;re building the forms for date fields, it&#39;d be good for us to set a max width so that it doesn&#39;t take up the full half, um.
50% of the screen because the width of the field should be relative to relative to the um the content that will go there.
So our date field will never have more than this much text so if we make it a little bit bigger than that.
It will be ah um look a little bit more cleaner. And for multi-select In terms of um colors, um I think it&#39;s okay for us to introduce a new green color for forms like this because in the past we were using orange which sometimes signifies danger.
If you&#39;re selecting something and it&#39;s um. a green color which is saying that you completed it. The other thing that we want to standardize is anytime we have a field like this that&#39;s buttons put it on the right side because that&#39;s where users will expect it.
And then for sessions umm it will be umm. I deal if we maintain the details that we have on the current sessions page because clients are used to seeing that because there&#39;s some like uh additional details that we show on the D by default.
So let&#39;s see if we go to sessions. Uh we saw type, code, title, and then we also saw leaders, theme, schedules, um group.
You use it using it to troubleshoot whether they scheduled everything. Let&#39;s see what else can I think of here. here.
Let me show you one more thing. Thanks. Thank you. This is one of the companies that I umm met at the conference last week and they have a way for faculty to create different sessions.
And content in their system. And I was not video. y&#39;all. let&#39;s see. See ya. somewhere they had a video of.
Okay. This is not exactly umm like our sessions. This is more of creating content. But one of the things that they provide is a, simple interface where they can write the learning objectives.
So let&#39;s say if I am a faculty member and I have these objectives or session objectives that I&#39;ve created umm.
somewhere else, I can come in here, copy and paste it, and then it will allow me to basically have that in here with one, two, three, whatever coding that we provide.
But it&#39;s So, uhm very easy to type, press enter, add the next one, add the next one, add the next one, uhm rather than having to click add session objective, save, add session objective, save, uhm being able to Thank you.
You know, write it in naturally, um, almost like they&#39;re writing in a Microsoft Word document, but it&#39;s creating separate objectives for each of them.
Um, so, in our interface, what I was thinking was on this page, when we are adding or editing a session, um, when you get to the session objectives, once you click add or we add, add the first session and you type in code objective, and then when you click enter, it automatically would add another one</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6745e2cf673946fca3f9ca188df18613</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Exploring Medtrics Curriculum Module 🌟</pre></td><td><pre>This video will take a look at Metrix Curriculum Module and a couple of the reasons why it may help an organization during the accreditation process or during a site visit.
Metrix allows you to organize the entire curriculum in one interface. You can map these objectives to your national standards, import your program objectives, courses, rotations, and all the objectives for each of those courses and rotations, and also create various lectures, labs, small group sessions
and other academic activities and then tag those in. activities with standardized keywords, instructional methods, assessment methods, resources. Once all of this is organized, the leadership team as well as the faculty members can go ahead and search the entire curriculum, then visualize how all of
your objectives are connected together. In this particular example, I&#39;m seeing a course-level objective tied to an institutional objective, which is tied to a national objective.
When you have a site visit or an accreditation process happening, this is something that can be pulled up on-site. screen to show the site visitor how all of this is connected together.
Same thing applies for keywords and other types of methods that are used to tag the So, let&#39;s say if I want to look for sessions where we teach microchips.
I can search for it and it&#39;ll show me all the lectures or labs where this topic is taught. I can export this into a spreadsheet or Excel file.
There&#39;s also other reports that allow you to see how much time is being spent in different types of learning activities and also an audit of changes that were made to the curriculum.
If your institution is also struggling with mapping these objectives, Metrix also provides an AI-powered mapping tool. If I&#39;m a biochemistry professor here and I open this up and I have six or seven lectures that I&#39;ve created, I can click on one of them and I&#39;ll see all the objectives that are tied to
that lecture. When I look at this first objective, I can see all the unmapped course objectives here. If I want, I can map this one by one or I can click this AI mapping button and it&#39;ll take all of these course objectives, analyze them, and give me a recommendation for which course objectives aligns
with this session objective. And as a faculty member, I can quickly map this by approving what the AI has recommended.
So with the AI mapping, as well as the searching and the tagging, you&#39;re able to fully organize the curriculum quickly, and then also have a way to present it to the accreditation body when they send, when they come on site.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4cb71941653c497b93c19abec4ab4b91</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Italian School Pricing Negotiation 🇮🇹</pre></td><td><pre>This document outlines the Italian pricing for July 1st onwards for their all of their schools for for about three months we had regular meetings with them last year to discuss the pricing adjustments and during this long negotiation period we came to the agreement that we&#39;re going to have a transition
period of three years where we are incrementally adjusting them to our new pricing and these pricing tables include to all of the modules, however, their schools.
modules are not using all of them, um, so if you look here, this table at the top is our standard pricing.
This is for any institution with more than seven, 7500 trainees and the institutions are Ross University School of Medicine, American University of the Caribbean, Ross University Vet School.
So even though this is Ross University Vet School and Ross University School of Medicine are part of the same university, for the contract they&#39;re considered two separate institutions.
So we won&#39;t be adding them together to get that 7500. Then we have Chamberlain. So we look at these tables, there&#39;s a 15% off if it&#39;s more than 7500.
But since we don&#39;t have more than 7500 without the BSN, Chamberlain will also be using the same pricing table. So we look at this, we have what Ross will be for next year, um AUV.
AUC, Ross FET, and then Chamberlain we would have to adjust this based on the number of trainees. The key things here is the way that a talent&#39;s pricing works is, at the end of the year, we run a report in Metrix, so if I go to.
our company portal, so logging in, and then company, there is this report called billable, and what we want to do is run this report from last uh May.
May 1st, um actually we we can check to see when we ran it last time, and I believe Chris or Chris and I would have an email exchange of when the last report was ran.
So if the last report was ran um two months before the contract ended, we would want to pick this year&#39;s report to include those extra two months.
And what this report does is is output an Excel file that has let&#39;s say end of May so this report shows various statuses so it shows whether the user is active or not.
which is not very helpful right since they haven&#39;t been deactivating all the users but what it what matters is if it says any of these conditions whether they logged in once whether they have at least one evaluation assigned any of these are one then it means they have used the system so what we typically
do is add a column to the right side and sum up uhm all of these numbers and then if it&#39;s greater than one then it&#39;s telling us that this user has been in the system or something like was assigned to one of our modules.
That means that it&#39;s considered an active trainee. If they&#39;re an active trainee then we get that total count and once we have that count we submit that for billing.
Then if that billing number that we&#39;re submitting is more than harder students. Then last year&#39;s invoice. So let&#39;s say then we invoice for a thousand it ends up being fifteen hundred was the actual number.
We are where we will be collecting that difference. If it&#39;s less than a hundred it&#39;s written off and then if it&#39;s significantly lower.
Let&#39;s say we bill for a thousand and they only have five hundred students in there. If it&#39;s more than a hundred lower we they will get at most five percent credit for the next year.
That&#39;s how we do billing for all of their schools and most of the time they&#39;re going up in volume and we end up having something that we&#39;re adding on.
So for every server they have Ross University, RossU, then there&#39;s RUSBM and then um AUC.metrixlab.com and then c***************. And this is something that these reports are something that Chris and Maria are used to preparing so they can prepare that.
Then what we want to do is exchange it with Chandan to confirm the numbers, see what the credit or debit will be.
And finally, that&#39;s, once we have the numbers for last year, the school will also provide us with what their estimated student count will be for next year.
And then we do the billing for next year based on that. So they tell us we expect to have 1,000 students for next year.
We do the 1,000 plus or minus any credit or debit from last year. So that&#39;s how the Italian billing is done.
And for this year, since we&#39;re going to be having a whole new statement of work that we&#39;ll be preparing, that statement of work will have all these tables in it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/53cc80a7fbcd49e985510f8e588b1305</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Santhosh Cherian | Your role goes here | Uxcel - 29 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys, I wanted to share this website. I&#39;m gonna add you to it. This is a UX training website there&#39;s a bunch of useful materials in here.
I&#39;m not, I mean this is something that you could go through if you&#39;re um, later on when you have time to learn.
But the reason I&#39;m adding you to this is this website is umm, very, uh, use a friendly and they have paid a lot of attention to the font hierarchy, the, um, white space, and how everything is presented.
Um, even like certain things like their, uh, skill- graphs, um, it&#39;s really well put together. And what I wanted us to do was look through and see if we can So we&#39;re going of the elements in terms of the font sizes.
So for example, you know, creating a hierarchy of the fonts. Um, when we have this here. It, uh, going back here.
So if I go to a page with a heading and a sub heading. So this could be courses. And if I go to here, uhm.
I&#39;ll be the courses font size. The h1. And let&#39;s see if we can find one with uh. So, It&#39;s subheading.
Yeah, so here&#39;s maybe h2 and the description underneath it. Um. And. Cause I&#39;m going to all over the place here.
But what I wanted to see if with first step is to create a font hierarchy that we could use throughout the platform and borrow that important hierarchy from this website.
I don&#39;t mean changing our font uh type. I mean the what are the sizes that we should- standardize. Um so if it&#39;s what&#39;s our h1 size, do we want to bold it?
Do we want to uh not bold it? What&#39;s the h2 size? And then for each of these filters, um maybe what we need.
Is whatever size is for these things ui components. That could be the h3. And then for the body text. Um.
What do we want to do? Then the l- I don&#39;t think we need to change the left menu but we can compare it.
Um. So that way we&#39;re creating a hierarchy that we can standardize and use across the platform. And it might already be a good hierarchy, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;d be good for us to uh compare.
And the other thing is when it comes to these fields, um. So when it comes to these fields, it&#39;s good for us to- uhm also send, set some UX parameters where if it&#39;s a date field.
field. uuhm we have a max size for it so that it doesn&#39;t take the full width because it, it should, the size of the fields should be uh relative to the content that will go in there.
So if we&#39;re putting the date in here, we don&#39;t need this full width and if we&#39;re- we have it shorter um that would be better.
So you can see on this page we&#39;re kind of- . . looking at um the year and a month is shorter than these other fields.
Same thing with uh something like a check box. So let&#39;s go down here. Yeah.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6442b80bb7f5437890c07c9b14307481</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Proposal Modifications Overview</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to send you this video with this proposal to explain some of the modifications that we made based on our discussion yesterday.
One, we have added a couple of modules such as the benefits and the uh the uh the uh uh elective application management.
We also and removed the optimizer so that it&#39;s more in line with the conversation yesterday. We also added the all the clinical students here and then the curriculum management is uh still the same and it&#39;s here.
So this is the annual subscription once we are fully uhm up and running with the system. But during this first transition period where you have an overlap with the existing platform, we put together this phased uh implementation and transition period and this here shows the prorated amount plus the one-time
onboarding fee. This is what it would, the system would cost during this phase as a prorated amount. However, I know that whenever we work with an institution, there is always a limitation on what can be added to the budget from the finance department.
So, we want to leave this. Uh, open to discussion with you so that you can have that internal conversation and we can provide a one-time transition pricing adjustment here to get you to that budget that allows us to get started with metrics this year and have that overlap period and then go forward.
it to the full license once the renewal happens. So please review this and discuss it with internally and you can let us know where we need to be to get started.
I think rather than us providing a number and trying to assume what your institutional budget is, it&#39;s always been more productive for you to have that conversation internally and let us know and we can make that adjustment here because we&#39;re interested in having that long-term partnership and we want
to make that possible with that overlap with the existing system because it is always going to help you with that transition.
So please let me know if you have any questions. And then I&#39;m happy to also hop on a call Thursday or Friday to talk through any additional details after you have your conversation with your team.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/27a4159082c54165a98d798b2a8c21d4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Case Logs and Custom Requirements Configuration 👩‍⚕️</pre></td><td><pre>look at case logs and how you can configure custom requirements for students to complete diagnosis and procedures when they go to clinical rotations.
So the first thing that we typically do is standardize a set of diagnosis in the system and then group them into categories based on.
rotations. So here in the simple example we&#39;re seeing students are expected to see five patients with pneumonia in pediatrics, two patients with allergies, three patients with asthma, five patients with croup.
We can edit this and change the minimum and order the category if needed. Typically, we would have separate categories for each rotation that you want the logs to be completed in.
And then for diagnosis, we would configure how many they have to complete for every single diagnosis. You can also leave this blank if there is no minimum that&#39;s required.
Procedures, we do the same thing. For each type of rotation, we create a category and define how many procedures they have to do as part of that rotation.
Then, we can configure templates. Each template can have different sets of fields they have to complete. So for example, you want them to tell you what date they completed the procedure, their patient&#39;s age, the preceptor or faculty member they worked with, the complications.
It&#39;s all up to you what information you want them to complete. Most of the time, it&#39;s best to keep it simple.
Ask them to submit the date, the rotation that they work or working in, and the preceptor. And it&#39;ll it&#39;ll make it very easy for them to log cases.
There&#39;s also a way to define different types of um diagnosis for that particular clinical setting. So here it&#39;s saying for pediatrics, I want to have these four diagnoses.
And I also want this to be used only in pediatrics rotations. I can come down here and say pediatrics. So with this configuration, learners will only be able to use this template if they are assigned to a pediatric rotation and they would only be able to use this set of diagnosis when they log the cases
. We can make it as granular as possible or we can have one template with all the diagnosis and all the rotations so they can log it whenever they want to.
We&#39;ll be going over this in more detail and configuring it to basically to match your requirements. First thing that we want to look into is a list of all the diagnosis, minimum requirements, and the categories, list of all the procedures, the categories, and the minimums for that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e37a73e4d682428b85658002268ab718</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Academic Year Webinar Update</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so hey Marcus and Katie. Creating this uh uhm video to go over this new webinar. It&#39;s an updated version of last year&#39;s webinar.
We&#39;re going to cover getting ready for the new academic year. And Marcus uhm you can help uh lead the conversation and Katie and I can cover the different sections.
Uhm so for example in the intro you can start to do the intro slide and then when we get into the webinar uhm there are five checklists that I&#39;ve prepared and we&#39;re going to split this up between Katie and I.
Uhm she may take one or two and I&#39;ll take the the other ones. So the first one is going to be the finalize the academic year.
Like we&#39;re currently coming to an end of an academic year. What are some of the things that we want to do to close out the year?
Then getting ready for the new year. We can uhm update the users in the system and make some changes to that.
Then we want to prepare the schedules, review the evaluations that we have configured, and then some engagement strategies that we have.
Uhm so you can do this slide too if you feel comfortable doing that. And then when we get to here, you can pass it on to whoever&#39;s going to be taking this slide.
Say, you know, let&#39;s get started with finalizing the academic year. Uhm, you know, what are the things that we want to cover?
And then whoever&#39;s covering this slide will go ahead and run through this checklist. So, so I&#39;m going to create, I&#39;ll create this video with that includes the, uhm, what I&#39;ll be covering if I was doing this slide.
So at the end of the academic year, we want to make sure that the outstanding data is closed before we go into the new year.
So what are some of the things that we want to check for? First thing is we want to cancel any outstanding evaluations.
If there are overdue evaluations that preceptors or faculty members have not completed, either we want to have them completed before the end of the year or we want to go ahead and cancel it.
Canceling an evaluation is um and we&#39;ll go over how to do that. The next thing is uh reviewing outstanding work hour violations.
If you&#39;re a GME program we want to make sure that all of that is reviewed and closed out. Review outstanding case logs that needs to be signed off on.
Any documents that are expiring as well as any. See you soon. Umm onboarding requirements we still have to review. So let&#39;s go through each of those one by one.
We want to start with evaluations. On the evaluations and assignments page we can filter for evaluations that have a overdue status.
And go in here and select the ones that we want to cancel. And then under the action menu click the cancel button.
If you notice here there&#39;s a cancel option and a delete option. Cancelling and evaluation will remove that from the reminders list and the preceptor or resident will not be able to complete it.
But you maintain your record that it was canceled. Yeah. If it gets deleted and you&#39;re removing all evidence that it was ever assigned.
So my recommendation is if something has been correctly assigned and it&#39;s been umm it hasn&#39;t been completed cancelling is the best option.
If it was incorrectly assigned you can delete it. Next we want to review all of the outstanding work hour violations.
Some under work hours violations. We have a list of items umm that may have been sitting around and these are violations that occurred on the work hours module.
So if anything any of these items are marked as pending ending. We want to review that. You can click this blue uh hours button to see what work hours triggered this violation.
What the trainee wrote. Then we want to put in a response as an administrator on what was done to address this work hour violation.
Then that will change the status to review it and we have closed out this violation. As for case logs, if you&#39;re logging cases in metrics for this your training program, it&#39;s good to go to the case logs page and then filter for case logs that have a status of pending and make sure that by for the end</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2765a93623514f42a72013a19d344393</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Managing Courses &amp; Rotations in Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to cover how Metrix organizes all of your courses and rotations in the system and how it&#39;s tied to different curricular courses as well as different rotations at various sites.
So we&#39;ll get started with the framework under Gradebook called Graded Courses and Rotations. Essentially, here we&#39;ll see after we have configured everything, information organized into categories.
So core rotations, we have elective rotations, we have the academic courses for your first and second year, and depending on your training program, what we need is a list of all courses, their codes and names, and it has to match exactly what you have in your student information system, because this
information is what we use to send data out of the platform in the future if you need to do some sort of integration, or if you&#39;re downloading data and importing into Metrix, the course codes allow you to match the data to make sure that it mirrors what&#39;s in the other platforms the university is using
. So we recommend using Metrix. Then going into your student information system and exporting a list of all of the courses, all of the rotations, and their names.
And we will provide you with a spreadsheet that you can use to populate this information. Our team will review it, and we&#39;ll do a bulk import to have this all created for you.
Once the graded courses and rotations are set up, each course can be linked to curricular courses. So for example, we have biochemistry that is created in the gradebook, and then we have biochemistry that&#39;s created for that particular semester.
So this particular semester or year, we have a biochemistry course, and this is connected to the biochemistry course, or whatever course name it is, in the gradebook.
On the clinical side, we have something called rotations. So every rotation that is in the system is mapped to a site.
So Hospital X is offering dermatology here, and each of those rotations are also mapped to that gradebook rotation. This allows you to schedule them to different hospitals, but the grades are all being connected to the same dermatology uhm gradebook rotation.
So what we need is, on this side, for rotations, you want to get a list of all of the different sites that you have to have students going to, and then for each site, we&#39;ll need to collect a list of rotations that are offered there, and then we will use that to map it to the gradebook rotations.
So scheduling can use these rotations at different hospitals, and the registrar can use the that that uh uh map that grade back to the course or rotation they need to get credit for.
So to review, in the gradebook, we have rotations and courses that match what&#39;s in your student information system. These courses are mapped.
These courses down here are mapped to courses in the curriculum. You know, this includes anatomy, biochemistry, and so on. And for the clinicals, under schedules and rotations, we create each of the rotations that are offered at each affiliated site.
And those are mapped to the graded courses and graded rotations that are in the gradebook. So you may have dermatology being offered at several hospitals.
So you&#39;ll have multiple entries here. Each of those dermatology rotations will be mapped to the same gradebook rotation that allows us to capture that grade for the transcripts or other records that is stored in the pseudo-information system.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/23c639d3e79b41dc8e4d7aeddb073d2a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setting up Leads and Opportunities in Close</pre></td><td><pre>So, we got a new submission for a demo from our website. I have to check to see if I added you to the hello inbox.
This is where the leads come in. So, I want to show you how I set up these leads. So, if this came in, copy the name, go to close.
One of the first things that I do is check to see if that institution already exists. It looks like we have them.
And we haven&#39;t talked to them in a few years. But it looks like this is a different person there. So what we want to do is, since it already exists, I don&#39;t have to create the lead.
Otherwise I would have created a new lead. And then, for this particular lead, it&#39;s a organization type is GME. They apparently requested a demo in the past.
And what I want to do is add the contact. And I would create a new opportunity. And when we do the opportunity, we want to make sure we&#39;re on the leads.
And hot chasing. We don&#39;t know the uh amount. And this is a contact. Save. Now if I go to opportunities, I&#39;ll see that.
Here let&#39;s uh we gotta make sure we&#39;re on the right pipeline. This one is not it. This is the leads pipeline that we have to look at.
And it&#39;ll be, should be showing up here. There you go. And I usually like to call them immediately. So I&#39;ll leave this on while I call them.
Good morning, Freddie. This is Santosh calling from Metrix. Hey, how you doing? So um, you were on our website, we&#39;re checking out the software, and I saw that you sent in a Consultation request, would love to hear more about what you&#39;re looking for If you have a few minutes.
Santosh. So um, the reason this conversation for us, on our side, came about, uh, was because we wanted to take 145 Consultation.
Okay. On the reporting, we&#39;re, you know, 40 articles, 40 records, and um, it&#39;s not very easy. Okay, that&#39;s great. In terms of ah reporting challenges that you&#39;re mentioning, is it specific to you?
to a type of ah workflow or what are you using 145 for? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so So is there anything particular that that changed that or is it simply a general feedback and you&#39;re exploring or is there anything prompt?
Yeah. Okay, yep. Yeah. Yeah. yeah yeah yeah You had to pay for it separately? For the same data, or is it?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. That&#39;s an AI, AI curriculum mapping, right? Okay. Yeah. I see. Yeah, I mean that&#39;s uh it&#39;s a common common trend that we are seeing in UME where a lot of organizations have been using multiple products and then each vendor has a separate fee so it kind of adds up.
But if you have more consolidation, it um it it saves uh both uh real money and opportunity cost. The one question I had is like um so you could renew it for um one year for 145.
Are you looking to uh use if you find a product that is a good fit are you looking to get something up and running sooner so that you have some overlap or was there a timeline that you&#39;re you have uh determined?
Yeah, what do you use switching to canvas? Oh God. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s uh what you&#39;re trying to say, but I know uhm that it won&#39;t be 5% per year.
Okay. And so getting back to your point uhm, you don&#39;t have a hard deadline. right now, it just so happens that, um, our, um, our precocious, um, team met with somebody in your company, and he, um- Is it Dr.
Kogan? No, it&#39;s not Dr. Kogan. I do remember him, though. Because I remember, uh, it was I think my colleague, um, spoke to him a couple, a few years ago, um, because I say, uh, because when you, when the request came in, um, it came in through your institution, so it had some notes that, uh, we talked
to Dr. Kogan in twenty, twenty-nineteen, I think, um. at, uh, maybe probably at the ACGME conference or something, or I mean AMC conference or something, and, uh, Okay.
Okay. Awesome. Um, let&#39;s see. So what you&#39;re um describing is uh pretty much our the bread and butter of what we do.
Um and we support all four years. Um, including these curriculum. It&#39;s all built for AMC&#39;s standards. It um, so if you already have it in 145 in a similar standard, we can easily move that over.
Um, quick scheduling. Uh, evaluations. Competency management, uh case logging, um, we also do MSPE generation. So, um, so my recommendation is, um, since it looks like you&#39;re trying to consolidate into one platform, um, I can do an initial call with you and give you a high-level overview of the different
modules. Then, we can, uh, have a series of separate meetings with different, um, departments, maybe the clerkship team, the curriculum team, the pre-clerkship, and student affairs.
So, that way, um, we can present the solutions that are specific to them, rather than trying to cover everything in, uh, one, uh, call, because there&#39;s a lot, and then, uh, usually, if they&#39;re, if it&#39;s broken up, they&#39;re able to answer, ask questions that are more targeted towards their operations.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f312c3a451084a1ebca347e3781c7b2c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (3026) - 29 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I think we can remove hi there and then keep this um uh instead of hello um e and gm e we can say uh metrics administrators because we also have nursing and bed schools so we&#39;ll keep it generic and be better.
umm since we already kicked off the training. Thank you. It&#39;s uh, we want to be, we may want to tweak this a little bit and say that upcoming training.
And then for any time we&#39;re putting a time down, it&#39;s good to- put the um time zone also. and uh.
for the copy um. I think we can- remove this until we have a full schedule. Kind of looks a little confusing when we have one event and then a different time here.
If we have a full schedule it would have been a little bit more clear that this is the future. We just leave it at the time.
And then leave this out and for the other copy like this heading it&#39;s okay to be centered or these these items let&#39;s left justify it so that it looks more consistent.
I was doing that UX training on that website that we recently found and they were talking about this and how it&#39;s better to be left justified instead of centering text.
But I think for the title it&#39;s probably okay. This whole section is probably okay but everything else being left justified.
And then for. I think there was another email. But this email. From last week I think there&#39;s also a duplicate here.
You can get rid of one of the hey there&#39;s. And then we have an extra dot period here. And we can maybe some extra.

I&#39;m sending over this proposal that the team put together, and I wanted to run through a few things here.
Based on our discussion, we have updated the student licenses to include both years, so that all the clinical students are covered.
We&#39;ve also included the clinical application manager. The time off module, as well as, uhm, the uhm, uhm, the onboarding module.
I think these are the ones that we talked about yesterday that we wanted to include. If anything needs to be added or removed, uhm, beyond this, that we- anything that we missed, please let us know and we can make that adjustment.
And then the curriculum module is here. We also removed the optimizer from the package for now. And, uhm, down here we have the annual re-renewal cost, and for the first year, uhm, the implementation is going to be about two, a couple months, and we put together the first phase from August 1st to February
27, 2025, so that we&#39;re trying to time it for when the existing contract ends. Uhm, normally if, if this was transitioning in the next, uh, uh, uh, two, two to three months, we could simply go straight into it, uhm, and get started when the, uh, new year is starting.
But since we have that overlap, we want to figure out a way to fit metrics into your budget without having to wait until next May to get started.
So this is the prorated cost with the implementation. But one of the things that I&#39;m leaving open here is, uhm, you know, we understand that budgets are limited and there&#39;s only so much that can be added when an existing budget item is already there for the, the other platform.
So, uhm, you know, you can discuss this with your team and please let us know. Uhm, what we can do here to, uhm, get to a point where you can get started in August and we can make the adjustment for that first year as a courtesy to, uh, absorb that cost from our end to get you started so that we are
building that long-term relationship. Uhm, so, uhm. This is something that, uh, we&#39;d like you to help us come up with a budget.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1e6f2327d0d747f093f091387895ff47</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Why You Should Praise In Public &amp; Criticize In Private | Radical Candor - 16 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Um one or two explain why i was asking that.

I was going over some design changes and umm. She had a good idea for making some tweak to one of the pages.
And I said let&#39;s- let&#39;s go and we can do that. It&#39;s a good modification. I don&#39;t remember exactly what it was.
But one of the things that she said to me afterwards was like uhh yeah if it- don&#39;t mind I&#39;m gonna uhh tell real if uhh if you ask that this was something that you were okay with doing.
Or you said you suggested we do. Which made me a little concerned because that indicated to me that she was not feeling comfortable with bringing an idea or presenting something to me.
And for me it seemed as though that she would be concerned that you would be upset about it. And that&#39;s not a good thing because you know if.
If someone has an idea for a feature or design or modifying something they should be they be feel very comfortable with with bringing that up with any one that&#39;s a senior member of the team.
if they are uh it&#39;s sucking it and that&#39;s why I mean I said that in the other last week in the meeting you know it&#39;s something that I don&#39;t want her to be stuck in the middle of any sort of debates about design and uh because it&#39;s not a good place for a new team member to be in and uh if if she is doing

Based on this transcript, please write an email. Summarizing this. And it. Pasted the transcript in here. You can get the transcript directly from the recording by copying transcript.

So I asked her to rewrite it in a way that I can have requirement um one after another. You have requirement, solution, requirement.
I like to use the word uh um challenge if it&#39;s something that is their existing use existing medical school or hospital and they&#39;re facing a challenge.
In this particular case, they&#39;re starting a brand new school and it also pulled out all the questions they asked and what the answers were and then wrote out the next steps.

Things that they suggested, let me, that I wrote and then send this in a well formatted email.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7832fe829fc741f4b6b27fff55e9ac7f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Dashboard Announcements and Welcome Messages 📣</pre></td><td><pre>So on the dashboard we have the announcements functionality. When you first get started with Metrix the dashboard is what every user sees when they first log in.
It&#39;s a powerful tool to provide them with some context to the platform how Metrix will be used by that person and also to provide any initial training materials.
So I recommend that as you get started over the next few weeks and define the processes for the system you create a welcome message that can be shared with all of the new users when they first log in.
You can create custom messages for students and another message for faculty members or you can do one message for everybody.
Key thing is to have something here when they first access the platform. It&#39;ll be a welcome message from your, your, you with instructions as well as any hyperlinks to resources that&#39;ll help them succeed.
And metrics announcements can also be formatted with different types of text formatting. You can also include attachments here and select who will receive this email.
You can choose one or more roles. And then you can also say whether you want to send it out in an email or simply show it on the dashboard.
If you want to test it out with your existing onboarding committee members, you can also include it as an email.
Otherwise, it&#39;s fine to keep it as a post so that it shows up on the dashboard when your users first sign in.
And over time, as you use the platform, the announcements features can be used to send out important updates to your learners and educators.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cceb941839d04db28f6965d840814453</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Offer Discussion 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Truthy, hope you&#39;re doing well. Took me a little longer to put this together because I wanted to meet with Chris, my partner, and talk through this with him so he&#39;s in alignment.
Chris is the other managing member of the LLC and has been helping me build the company. Since 2014. So I want to make sure that everything that we discussed is something I share with him and get his um feedback on it and any any concerns that he has so I went over this with him and he&#39;s uh definitely
in agreement with the things that I have outlined here um and I also even though he hasn&#39;t met you yet he&#39;s very excited about having someone like you on the team because I think it&#39;ll allow us to expand to the next stage of growth um so a few things at the top I started writing out different things
that I&#39;m currently managing that I want to spend some time with you in the beginning to train you on um some of these items so that you could take ownership of it and we can you know expand on this list or modify this list as needed over time but I figured I&#39;d at least start with putting some of these
items down on a document and down here I&#39;ve put together three separate offers uhm and before we get into the numbers I also want to point out something what I see happening is over the next couple of years you know maybe even shorter depending on how quickly we&#39;re growing uhm working towards uh getting
you involved with all areas of the business and then considering whether you&#39;re you&#39;re interested in a role of something like chief operating officer uhm as the company&#39;s growing again this is something that potential career path uhm all of this is something that uh we can figure out and and uh sort
out as we are working together uhm you know I don&#39;t wanna guarantee it I also don&#39;t know if you&#39;re gonna if your mindset is gonna be the same in a year from now but this is a potential uhm based on your interest and your background.
So the first offer here essentially is uhm what I had mentioned on the calls is having all cash as a W2 employee where you have the 130k base and then the 30k target bonus which is something that you and I would define uhm as goals and then once those goals are met at the uh at the end of the year uhm
it would be a bonus that gets paid out based on company meeting its goals and the individuals meeting it uh their goals and trying to do all of the goals in a way that is achievable uhm and the reason I structured this way is so that uhm you know as a company with a certain amount of cash flow uh monthly
cash flow is is uh the most important thing uh by the end of the year when we get to uhm the bonus time we&#39;re expecting for our revenue to go up and then we&#39;ll be able to pay out the bonus as well.
That being said, we also talked about the shares and this first option is essentially less bonus but some of that being uhm structured as equity and then the equity is vested over four years that that uh like our stock standard whenever we offer shares is over four years.
Um, one thing that I want to point out here, I&#39;m going to go into how we value the shares in a second.
But one thing I do want to point out is, um, you&#39;re going to be, you would be coming in as a partner like myself or Chris with these shares.
But in a other tech startups, a lot of times they go through series A, series B, series C, and the earlier shareholders are getting bought out and they&#39;re cashing out when there&#39;s another level of fundraising.
As a bootstrap company, um, we are right now not planning on doing another round of fundraising. Again, that could all change depending on our needs. Um, and we are not planning on selling, you know, we&#39;re not, I&#39;m not building the company with the idea of selling it.
I&#39;m all open to all possibilities depending on the situation. And there may be an acquisition that happens down the road, you know, chances are there is because in our market, a lot of times it does happen, um, but I&#39;m not planning on that.
So, if, when you, for individuals that do have shares, what I&#39;m anticipating happening is, you know, as our revenue goes up, and we have more cash flow, making it possible for individuals to shell, sell back the shares to the company, so they can cash out, and get that, um, in, in, in cash, uh, when
they want to, and the company has the opportunity to buy it back. Um, that is in the event that we are not getting acquired, or we&#39;re not getting an additional fundraising, and, uh, right now, I don&#39;t have a timeline for that, but given the pace that we&#39;re growing, uh, you know, maybe in the next, uh
, uh, three to five years, um, obviously, there&#39;s going to be preferences for people that have been here longer to have their shares.
Their shares bought back first, if they want to do any sort of, uh, uh, uh, uh, sell, uh, selling, but I wanted to present that because it&#39;s going to be, um, slightly different than what you may have heard from other slander tech companies, uh, and the reason I like going this route is it allows us to
control our own destiny and what we&#39;re doing rather than having venture capital funds investing into us and then having to force, uh, raise another round and then having to sell to another venture capital fund.
It allows us to grow at, at a, um, our pace, control the culture, um, but for the shares. Um, we will need to grow a little bit more before we can start to buy these shares back.
And it will be at that, at the value at that time. Um, health insurance is included and I believe our budget right now is for the, uh, $350 or four hundred dollars.
I think it&#39;s $350, $350 per, for the plan and there are several Aetna plans that, uh, that is fully covered.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2b5df4e0346e431bba8279455d298cd3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Overview of Webflow Structure</pre></td><td><pre>Aaron, so I wanted to, I was in Webflow, and I wanted to give you an overview of how it&#39;s structured.
So, when I go to this home workspace, you have the opportunity to open up a designer, or you can open up the editor.
The editor is where it&#39;s a CMS that you can use to create new pages and edit the content, but it won&#39;t let you change the styles of the page layout.
So, if I open up this particular view, it Gives me. You know, a left menu that has, you know, these are all the different pages that we have.
Collections are meant to be Different types of content that we could have, uhm, so for example, like use cases, there may be many use cases and it allows you to create multiple use cases and put it into a collection.
Blog posts, has another, where you can create multiple blog posts. So if we want to edit the blog post layout, this is what we would use.
So if I go to pages, it allows me to select what I want to edit, and then here we have components.
Components are meant to be the reusable sections that you can use in different parts of the system. And then, for example, testimonial slider.
And then on the right side is where I can click on and edit the CSS of it. You know, what&#39;s the position, what&#39;s the spacing, the min width, max width.
So, let&#39;s go to, let&#39;s say, something like the blog. One of the things that I&#39;ve been trying to figure out is like how do we make sure that these things are the same size.
So, I can probably go in here. Let&#39;s see. Anyway, so you can see how it&#39;s editing using that stuff on the right side And one of the things that I want us to do is Clean up the blog.
So one thing we want to call this Blog oh wait Yeah, we need to think about that we can call it MedEdge for now I&#39;m not sure if we want to call it MedEdge, but MedEdge Blog.
So we&#39;re kind of showing this MedEdge as our content channel and in terms of the look of the blog I wanted us to go with something similar to this where We have a clean header at the top And then we&#39;re going to embed a way for them to subscribe and as you come down We have a red And then all of the different
episodes and you can see here. We have categories for each of these and currently I don&#39;t think we have a way to create a category.
Uhm. So. We want to say. Simply. Actually, why don&#39;t we start with something simple. If there&#39;s a way that we could, if you can help with updating the header to say MetEdge and. much.
Uhm I come up with the text for here and then we&#39;ll update that and then for these articles, if we could make sure that when it shows up on this page, uhm it&#39;s all the same height and maybe we put a cap in the number of um.
text, the number of words that goes here and regardless of how many, how much text is added, it&#39;s a fixed height so that it looks cleaner and then on the, on the actual uh blog page itself.
That&#39;s a blog post template. We have this section at the bottom, I think this is a, this is actually a component.
So if I go to components, or maybe not. Yeah, so this would also be something that we want to have a fixed height.
So, if we could do something like that first, and then uhm Let&#39;s also take a quick peek at the author page.
So you can see author pages. It has the most recent one up here. And we can do the same thing. Fixed height. And then.
Yeah, let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s start with something like that and then uhm. Hopefully this give you a little bit more exposure to the web flow and.
See what other tweaks we want to make in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fdba94ef91364729807079c9ff8593c4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Managing Users and Metrics 📊</pre></td><td><pre>how to manage users and metrics. I&#39;m on the users page and I see three tabs at the top, people, groups, and invite.
On the people page we can see all of our trainees, educators, administrators, and other staff that we have created in the platform.
Here we have filters that are applied by default such as role, user type, and status. So you can notice, if you notice here, it&#39;s called affiliation status.
Every individual in the system has an affiliation with one or more programs in the platform. And if you&#39;re a medical school, then you may only have one program in the system and that, that is the only affiliation that the student has.
If you have a residency program or GME department that&#39;s using the system, you may have multiple training programs and the same individuals may be linked to multiple programs.
But for this status here, this is telling us that these individuals that we&#39;re seeing these 32 individuals have an active affiliation with my training program.
And when this individual graduates or leaves the department, I can deactivate that program affiliation and if they&#39;re part of another department, it&#39;ll remain active on that, that particular, that other program.
I can also use this search bar at the top to find individuals. So let&#39;s say I want to look for Gregory House, search for Greg House, and it gives me that individual uhm quickly.
Use that view profile button to see all of the demographic information for this user. The contact information, education history, attendance, and other demographic data that we have stored.
On the user&#39;s page, we can also use the edit demographics button to change their profile information. So, for example, right at the top we have our primary program affiliation.
This particular user is linked to the family medicine program. that&#39;s the trainee, or that&#39;s the user&#39;s primary specialty. If you&#39;re using it on the medical school or nursing school side, you&#39;re really going to only see one or two affiliations in this drop-down.
Most likely it&#39;ll be the school of medicine is telling us that this individual is employed by that school of medicine.
We also support secondary affiliations if there&#39;s more than one training program that this person is is working with. A couple other things here, we have the ability to update their photo, the email address.
We can come down here and add in a trainee or employee ID number. This is used throughout the system to upload data and it should be a unique identifier for this trainee.
Here, I can also set the home institution. This is the university this person is enrolled in or the university that employs this individual.
I changed this using the unlock function. I can also define a role for this user. All the way at the bottom, I have the ability to set an activation date.
The activation date is going to be the first day this user is allowed to log into Metrix as long as they have been invited to the system.
So, if you forgot, to invite someone and the activation date passes, it means they still cannot get in. You have to go and invite that user.
So now let&#39;s take a look at what that invitation looks like. On the invite page, I can see different types of users that have been created.
it. And you can see one here that hasn&#39;t been invited, not invited status. So for this individual, I can select that person and go to invite and either mark them as invited or actually invite them and send an email out, send an email out to them with a temporary password.
Most important thing to remember here is that if you invite them, they will have a password sent to them. If you, if your institution is using single sign-on and you want your students and faculty to use single sign-on, you don&#39;t want to send this email.
Instead, you&#39;re simply going to mark them as invited so that after the activation date, they&#39;ll be able to use your university credentials.
to log into Metrix. If there are external preceptors, go ahead and invite them. Then, they will receive that temporary password and they can use that to access Metrix.
As you get started through onboarding, we&#39;re going to be sharing some templates that you&#39;ll be filling out with all the different users you want to import.
But once we&#39;re done with onboarding, you can create your own users in Metrix using this add button, add person button at the top right, or you can add one person at a time, and it&#39;ll give you a way to fill out all their profile details and create their account.
Or you can use this link. It&#39;s import users with CSV option, and download the CSV template, fill it out with all the details of those trainees you want to create, and then do a bulk import.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/54417b4f150e4962b0dfe3195a48bfee</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 16 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>It might so for the custom filter that he&#39;s referring to is on the site&#39;s page and what we want to do is do something similar to a filter by custom questions.
So when I want to like we have done this on the case logs page and I can apply different filters and then submit and it&#39;ll show me the results.
We want to do the same thing on the site page where umm by default we want to give them the ability to filter for umm.
Actually, we can add the custom filtering option here and it will bring up the off campus and they&#39;ll be able to filter by the customer.
So if I go to sites, that means this is set up and go to customize. Alide. Go to custom fields.
Site fields. LMU has a lot of these site fields. You want to be able to list them out in the custom questions.
Option and then select what they want to filter by. And once you search for it, it&#39;ll return all of the sites that match that criteria.
We also want to, uhh when these results come up, it will be good if there&#39;s a way. Actually, we don&#39;t need to do that in the first version.
I was thinking that if there&#39;s a way to see what they&#39;ve, what, uh, what feels matched? But I don&#39;t want to add more columns here.
If they at least get the results, then they can open it up and see what, um. Additional feels they want to review.
So essentially, the main thing is a line that filter here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8b053c2067484d23ace6700e82043e23</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Engaging LinkedIn Content 🌟</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning. I wanted to share how I put together today&#39;s LinkedIn post using a method that allows us to create content quickly.
Essentially, I follow a lot of great content creators on LinkedIn and when I find something really inspirational from a leadership perspective, what I&#39;m trying to do is, how do I, what I&#39;m trying to do in my head is, how do I take this and use it in my everyday life, whether it&#39;s improving my leadership
skills or sharing this content with other someone else that may benefit from it. So for example, this post, I found it very interesting about questions you can ask to drive better outcomes.
So, what I did was, I downloaded of this carousel, you can click on it. And click download and it&#39;ll download it.
And then, gave this to ChatGPT, and I wanted to see what it will come back with. If I want to recreate this for a medical education audience.
So what it did, was it prepared a draft for me. And it&#39;s using scenarios for medical education. And then, I went into Canva.
well. Do you think I might have tried? Yeah, I tried a couple times. And then I went into Canva. And I had this carousel design saved already.
And started filling this information out. Into this carousel. I saved this as a brand, brand uhm, template if anybody else want to use it.
And it&#39;s also using the same font as our website. So, formatted it in Canva, exported it, and then I fed it back to the AI.
to prepare a LinkedIn post. One of the things that I like to tell ChatGPT to do is whenever I write a LinkedIn post, I want to tell it to use simple language and to use line breaks every two to three lines to make it easy for someone to scan.
Whenever that this blocks of text on LinkedIn, it&#39;s often skimmed and people are not reading it. By using these line breaks, it makes it more scannable.
So now I have a carousel and I have a LinkedIn in post and when I went into LinkedIn. and uploaded it here.
The only thing that uhm I may revisit here is uhm the brand colors but this is something that uh uhm is something that we can standardize for the team and have a carousel template that we can use and then whenever we want to create a carousel we can put something this uh use this template but the idea
is if you follow a lot of interesting content creators and see what they&#39;re I mean and I&#39;m talking about outside of the medical education industry you know uh like uhm in business, in sales, in marketing, and in customer success see what they&#39;re posting.
that is popular that you&#39;re finding interesting and then how do we add that twist to it so that it&#39;s for our audience.
It will help us come up with content ideas faster and also make it more relevant to our audience so they don&#39;t have to uhm they don&#39;t have to extrapolate that into medical education.
We&#39;re doing it for them.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b2e52093031c4c28865edf7fc8f3cc5f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 15 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So, for this lottery phases, we need to do some cleanup to make it more intuitive for the customer. So, if I go here and I, I&#39;m gonna go back to the beginning here.
So, right now I have a phase one. It is. Like the word phase one doesn&#39;t really tell me anything about what I, what it, like what does that mean to me as a customer.
Um, so this is, as soon as I create it, I don&#39;t necessarily early. I need it to be phase w- like we don&#39;t need to have so many phases, we can have, uh, the lot of it created, and then automatically it can be, uh, like for example right now it&#39;s- phase 2, which I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s different.
I&#39;ll go back to phase 1. I can do all the same things as phase 2. So instead of having phase 1 and 2, as soon as you create it, we can go straight to this page where you have the blocks getting added and the phase can be, instead of calling it phase 3, it would be umm create blocks.
So create a new lottery and then automatically it goes to create blocks phase. Once you create the blocks, then it makes sense to have the advanced phase, which now, it gets called, instead of phase four, call it pre-fill umm pre-fill phase.
And then instead of the advanced phase, Please. Uh we would we can call that as um. I don&#39;t know what just happened.
and uh. Thank you. Yeah, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happening here. So, it should be create this lottery then you go to uh create block phase by default.
And then the button should say advanced to pre-fill phase and that will lie to pre-fill it. Then it&#39;s advanced to student preferences.
And then, It&#39;s the run lottery phase. Yeah, I would need to get a better understanding of all these nine phases so that we can clean it up a little bit.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5b8a9a1cf00245088f2d08753f7bc2e4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Engaging LinkedIn Content 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning. I wanted to go through the process of how I put together a LinkedIn post from another post that I found very interesting.
So last week I read this carousel on sales, on important questions that you should ask a prospect during that sales conversation.
Actually, maybe it was not this one, but it was a similar, similar uhm post. And, let me see if I can find it.
Yeah, this one. Reverse engineering, post-mortem analysis, and so on. So, essentially, I found this into something that is relevant to our audience, which are medical education leaders or faculty.
So essentially, I took this PDF and I gave it to ChatGPT and asked it to help draft ideas or restructure it for medical education.
And I output a great uhm set of concepts that can be turned into a carousel itself. But it wasn&#39;t perfect, so I then edited it heavily.
And ended up with the text that I like. But it was a lot faster for me to do that than to write this from scratch.
And then once I edited it, I went into Canva and I had a template for a carousel that I have created before.
Which I&#39;ve saved this as a, brand template now, and then put that into this format. And once I had that, I exported it using the PDF option.
Then I also drafted a LinkedIn post, which essentially is a short form of the text in the carousel. And this, uh, this allowed me to put together this post for our audience, but ties in a very important message.
It&#39;s a leadership message that I&#39;ve learned from another author. And, uh, essentially, uhm, we can do this with other type of content that is not from the industry.
Thank you. And, uhm, easily use AI to help us restructure that for our audience. So we&#39;re delivering, uhm, content that&#39;s relevant to them, but it&#39;s also taking us less time to put together.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8dda02bf579e4254a4da4743cd090a21</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding the Organization of the Webflow Site</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to create this video to show you how the Webflow site is organized. Once you log into the website, you&#39;re going to see this page where you can say Open Designer.
And on this page, it&#39;ll give us the ability to edit the full website. On the left menu, we got uhm the ability to add different elements.
So essentially, what Webflow is, it allows uhm you to create uhm a website. Without having to write a lot of code.
So for someone like you, this may be taking longer. So I think you can go to the raw code here.
Let&#39;s see. Designing. You&#39;re not sure, but navigator shows you the website and you can see here the intro and the different components.
So the components are the reusable components that you can use in different parts.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b5833065943c4d5ba9247b670abda7d7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Managing Users in Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>This video we&#39;re going to take a look at our users page and how you&#39;re going to use the users page to manage your trainees and your educators.
So as a program level or department level administrator for the School of Medicine, I can go to the users page and I&#39;ll see all of my active learners and educators.
Here, I can use a search page, a search bar to find specific individuals and then if I want to click on it, I can either view the profile and see all their demographic information or I can click on it and click Edit Demographics to make changes to their profile.
If I&#39;m editing this person&#39;s profile, you&#39;ll see at the top right, there is something called Primary Affiliation. The Primary Affiliation is going to be the learner&#39;s specialty or department that they&#39;re training in.
For most university users, you&#39;re only going to have one program that&#39;s in there, such as the School of Medicine or School of Nursing.
If you&#39;re using it as a GME client, you&#39;ll have multiple departments here and you want to choose the one that matches your specialty.
You can always have secondary affiliations, where it&#39;s linked to additional departments if your user needs to be showing up in those departments for additional evaluations or schedules.
The other thing that I want to cover on this page is when it comes to creating new users, there are two ways you can do that.
One is add individuals to using this button here, add person, and I can say I want to create a faculty, a staff, a resident, or fellow.
Or on the left menu where it says import users with the CSV, I can download a spreadsheet template, possibly populated with this, the user&#39;s information, and then batch upload all those users into the system.
This process can also be used to update various fields for existing users. So let&#39;s say you created a bunch of users, you want to change all their phone numbers for some reason.
Instead of having to open up each profile and change it one by one, you can download the template, upload a new spreadsheet that has all the trainees&#39; ID numbers or email addresses, and then the new phone number.
Metrix will match up those ID numbers and see that it&#39;s existing in the system and change their phone numbers instead of creating a new users.
There&#39;s also a few filters that you can use here. This allows you to filter for let&#39;s say the third-year students or the fourth-year students.
So that allows you to narrowed down. groups of students as you&#39;re using the platform. Another thing that I want to highlight on this page is the invite tab.
Anytime a user is created in the system they will have an activation date that you&#39;re defining. And in addition to the activation date passing, the user also has the need to be invited to be able to log into the platform.
So here we have let&#39;s say Perry Cox. The the activation date is April 3rd 2024. Perry can only log into the system if it&#39;s April 3rd or later and he will receive an invitation for metrics.
That invite email has a temporary password that he can use to log into the platform. The only thing that you want to keep in mind is some of our clients or if you&#39;re a university client, you may be setting up single sign-on for your students and faculty members.
For those users, you&#39;re not going to invite them because you don&#39;t want to give them a temporary password in metrics since they&#39;ll be using the university login.
You simply want to select them and mark them as invited. So that&#39;ll give them the status of invited. They&#39;ll be using the university credentials to access a platform after the activation date.
So we&#39;ve gone over the users page, how to search for users, how to view their profiles, how to edit their demographic fields, create the users using the manual method, uploading them using a spreadsheet, and then inviting them to get access to the platform.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ba1c3b2b92b042f08ede8f412af47658</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Platform Overview</pre></td><td><pre>In this first video, we&#39;ll take a look at how everything is organized in Metrix, how we drive engagement from your learners and educators in some key parts of the platform, and also how you can get extra help using our knowledge base if you have questions.
So the first thing that I want to go over is the overall layout. So on the left side, we have our menu and the menu, you can collapse it if you need some more screen real estate using this little menu button at the top.
At the top, you can also switch into different programs if you have more than one program using the system. So, for example, School of Medicine is using it, School of Veterinary Medicine is using it, School of Nursing. If you need to have access to those programs, you can switch here.
The left menu also provides you access to the different port, different modules. So, for example, or if I&#39;m configuring the curriculum, section.
Top right, we have our portal switcher. By default, everyone is given access to the personal portal. If you have faculty access, then you have the faculty portal.
If you are a resident, you have the resident portal. If you&#39;re a student, you have the student portal. In addition to that, you have personal portal access.
You can also be granted admin access. Admins are individuals that have ability to edit all data within a specific department or program.
And institutional access is a second level of administration where you have global access to multiple programs in the system. So that&#39;s depending on your initial configuration and your needs, you&#39;ll see one or more admin buttons at the top.
Later on, we&#39;re also going to be covering more granular permissions that we can use to get individuals access to various parts of the system.
So if we need to give them access to the schedules, we can give them schedule access. If we need to give them access to evaluations, we can give them evaluations access.
But at this stage, in the beginning, we&#39;re simply dealing with program level access or departmental access and the institutional access.
As part of this initial setup, you can also go to the profile page, which you can access from my profile on the left menu, or by clicking on your photo at the top right and going to the profile page, you can upload your photo and edit some basic information here.
Now let&#39;s take a look at our knowledge base. Right at the bottom of the page, you have this knowledge base link, and if you&#39;re also looking at the bottom right, as a client, you also have a little orange button that is for chatting with our team members here.
But the nice thing about this chat button is it also has in it the integrated knowledge base, so if you go ahead and ask a question or a how-to question, we have an AI tool that will answer questions in the context of your institution.
So we&#39;re asking that, for example, if you&#39;re a medical school asking how to create medical students, it&#39;ll give you a custom response based on that question.
So, sometimes you can skip reading the knowledge base and simply ask the AI questions and it&#39;ll essentially review the knowledge base and give you very customized responses.
But if you want to browse all the articles, simply click on the knowledge base and you&#39;ll see different sections for various modules, you know, learner and educator profiles, the calendar, clinical schedules, case logging.
Each one has its own set of articles that you can open up and some also have videos that you can watch to see how metrics can be used for various operational needs.
We&#39;ll be covering some of the basics over the next few weeks as we do our onboarding meetings. I wanted to make sure that you have access to this if you want to skip ahead and read do some reading.
So we look forward to getting you set up in metrics and fully configured over the next few weeks and also training you on various parts of the platform.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/34d7bad0c3bb49fb8353f04f44ae2b6d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Task Clarification and Microcopy Review</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, uhm, for this particular task, I think we can clean up this acceptance criteria. For me it is a little confusing, uhm, and I was checking, uhm.
What, what the loom acceptance criteria looks like, and it looks like it&#39;s doing a pretty good job. So if I open up the loom video and click write a ticket, uhm, it&#39;ll give us something that&#39;s more concise.
When only show of schedules is, uh, enabled, they should only be able to see what they&#39;re supposed to see, uhm, and then, oh.
other assignments should be seen as, maybe we can put this in quotes, external sites, and then that really should cover what the task should do.
And then for the microcopy, let&#39;s see, for some reason I can&#39;t run that same thing on this one, maybe we can, we can, tighten that up a little, so I&#39;ll put this here.
So, uhm. So I think we can put this at the top. Uhm, we, it would be good if we could include a, an image that shows how this would be displayed as external site.
Uhm, and then I listed out these other places where we may want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t show up.
And then the microcopy improvements can be put, put towards the bottom.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/facdf20f428444e58b3ed76c9708eb8e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 15 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen, all of these uh looks, looks great, um um. One thing uh, one minor thing. Let&#39;s get rid of uh.
Actually, it like all of these have periods at the end of these uh, sentences. So we can make that consistent by adding periods at the end of all of the, And then for these reports, I know that it takes them to that specific tab on the appropriate page.
I am wondering if there is a way that we can indicate that here. Maybe in italics, we can put it underneath is a sentence that says this report is under the case module.
You will be routed to You will be this report is under the cases module. You will be routed to the report page when you click select criteria.
To return to this page. Press back on your browser. So that I mean again I might be able to work both but.
That way if I click on this I&#39;m going to a place where I have no way to go back to my previous umm report page at least they&#39;ll know that they had to click the back button.
Let me know your thoughts on that. And then this last one when I click this it doesn&#39;t select the tab.
The other one seemed to be working.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/97609d9f70764f3ca35ac6f061c8a7f5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi everybody, I wanted to share some feedback on this particular feature that we recently worked, bug fix that we recently worked on or feature, however we want to classify this.
This particular issue is something that we try to address, a problem that the customer reported and they point out a specific issue.
Today we had a meeting with, with DL to show them uhm the feature and then realized there was something else that was missing from it.
So I wanted to go through uhm the functionality, if I&#39;m looking at it, how I would. Analyze all of the things around that feature to make sure that we pick up on the uhm.
Any secondary problems so that we&#39;re not. Only fixing that one issue and then having the customer report every other issue.
What are possible things that can be wrong with it? This particular task, we wrote up the specs, we designed, we built the task, and then we had uhm two different people test it, and along that whole step, we didn&#39;t pick up on the uhm secondary problems.
So, for us to get a handle on our bugs and customers getting frustrated, we all have to start thinking about it as, if I&#39;m seeing one bug.
What else could be broken or what else could be there be a problem and then make sure that we&#39;re using these bug reports to to fix the entire problem and not just that one reported piece of code.
So here, let&#39;s go through this. This particular functionality allows the students who request an evaluation. So if I come in here, what we added was the ability to select a course and now I can select a course and then choose a preceptor.
Works great. The but if we&#39;re in here and we see course evals, we also check the course evals. First thing is like we we have a.
A drop down that&#39;s showing up. It doesn&#39;t apply when we&#39;re dealing with course eval, so there&#39;s no reason for us to give the student a field to select a course, cause that will cause confusion.
And then if I come here and I select. A. Faculty member and I submit. I&#39;m not sure what happened, but it it might have assigned it.
It might not have assigned, but it&#39;s not giving me the same feedback that it was assigned like it was when I did the course eval.
So that&#39;s another bug that there. Uhm? Let me see if we have any rotation evals here. I don&#39;t think we do yet.
But I think the rotation evals work fine so. Uhm, if we go to the next. Page that so we all have uhm access to this page and we we have this button here when we develop it or test it.
We also want to click something like this button to see where can I see all the viewed. Well, can I see all these requests at eval and then I come in here and I can see that the why it looks like the program eval is assigning and it&#39;s a front end bug that is not giving them the feedback that it was assigned
correctly. And then if I go here, I have a way to request evaluations here. If I select course, it doesn&#39;t work.
There&#39;s no way to select a course uhm after I select the course template. Let&#39;s try the program one. So here the program one doesn&#39;t show doesn&#39;t show the course or rotation drop down, which is good.
But it&#39;s inconsistent with the previous page. This works here but the other one doesn&#39;t. Now if I open this up, you can see here this is loading every single faculty member in the system and I just, it just unfroze my browser.
So. So that means that if any student or faculty member, I mean any student goes into this page and tries to assign.
a preceptor, their browser is going to crash. And I&#39;m using a very uhm powerful laptop with lots of RAM and it&#39;s freezing.
So this means that when we developed this bug and tested this bug, all we have checked is that one particular piece of code and make sure that&#39;s working.
We haven&#39;t checked anything else. And this is not something that is on a different part of the system or this is this is all part of that one widget and functionality related to that, so we&#39;re not expanding our uhm.
Testing and checking of the code to see if there&#39;s any other problems arising. On that bug fix, we&#39;re never going to be able to get a handle on these bugs because each time we fix something, we&#39;re fixing that one problem and then the customer is reporting another problem that&#39;s related and then another
problem and it&#39;s eventually they get frustrated because they&#39;re essentially being a bug tester for us. So, so what we all have to do is if I&#39;m writing up a particular bug, uh, think about what else may be broken.
If we&#39;re, if I&#39;m, if you&#39;re a developer working on a fixed. you know, actively think about, um, other parts of the system and what else would you be, uh, could you potentially improve to make sure that the, uh, the customer does not find another bug.
And then if we&#39;re testing it, same thing and look at. Um, look at the full feature, you know, you don&#39;t have to look at the entire module, but at least looking at in the, the drop downs around it, uh, make, uh, does it function properly, uh, is it, is it, uh, loading too much data, should we be, uhm,
paginating it, those are the types of things that we want to look at every time we are fixing a bug.
So this, uh, and it did not take me long, you know, I opened this up. And probably within five minutes, I noticed all these problems, uhm, for something like this, we should not have missed this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6c2efb6012fc4b8d86facf2d82be935c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adding Grouping and Sorting Functionality to Exported Reports</pre></td><td><pre>Like for this particular task, what we&#39;re going to do is Expand on the second report that&#39;s on this page, which is the export data And On this page, we&#39;re going to add the ability We&#39;re going to add the ability to group results And then, when you generate the report We can also put this checkmark To
the left side, like we have on the first page So, it&#39;s easy to see And then, when you generate the report It&#39;s going to export All of the This is only a sample What you want to do is take the Export report, basically pull it out of some random server and export the data And the If you say, if you say
in the design that Not this one, uhm If I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s going to be grouped by Course Then It&#39;s going to Sort it by the course And then at the bottom It&#39;s going to show The average by the course For each of the courses So if I choose it, or choose to group it by the role You&#39;re going to see something
like this Where it&#39;s all the roles together And then under each role It&#39;ll show you the average and the standard deviation And then we&#39;ll also show the overall average all the way at the bottom Which I don&#39;t have on this design So each of these groupings allows them to sort the data by that column and
then show the summary at the bottom of that particular item. So let&#39;s say if I want to sort by rotation, then it&#39;ll show the rotation under as average for rotation A, average for rotation B, and so on.
And we also want to, we can start by checking in the export data, current export data, to make sure we have all of these columns.
If we don&#39;t have all these columns, then it&#39;s going to be hard to group by that. So maybe the first thing that we can do is get an export, and then put it into Google Drive, uhm and then identify which column we will be grouping by.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/37e21df7713c4f8ab98528c806601bf6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Welcome to Metrix. In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how data is organized in Metrix, the left menu, the navigation on the top, and some of the ways that you&#39;ll be using Metrix over the next few weeks as we get started with implementation.
To start with, the left menu shows all of the different modules that you have access to, and as we go through onboarding, we&#39;ll be covering different parts of the system here.
On the top, you have the name of the organization and a way to switch to different programs if you&#39;re going to be configuring multiple programs within your platform.
There&#39;s also a way to, collapse your left menu at the top if you have, if you need more screen real estate.
Top right, we have the portal switcher. Essentially, every person in the system has access to the personal portal. If you&#39;re a faculty, you have the faculty portal.
If you&#39;re a student, it&#39;s a student portal. If you&#39;re the resident, you&#39;re the resident portal. Some users, such as yourself, also have administrative access.
This can be done as a department or program level administrator or on, if you have multiple programs using Metrix, an institutional level access.
When you first log in, you may be taken to the personal portal. You want to switch over to the admin portal, where we&#39;re going to be doing most of the setup.
There&#39;s also a way to click on your photo at the top right and edit your photo and other details in the profile page, which can also be accessed in the My Profile link at the top, on the top left.
The key thing on the uh in this video that I also want to show is our knowledge base. So if you need a little help, click on this button.
It&#39;ll take you to a new page where you can see all the different articles in our knowledge base. So even before we cover some of these topics Thanks.
In the onboarding meetings, you can check out what is capable, what metrics is capable of in the knowledge base. And if you have specific questions, you also have this chat window that you can use to connect with our team.
So we look forward to getting you onboarded and configured and fully trained on metrics over the next. In few weeks.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/65f5b4f6713144c4a8f7c7dffd2e7b54</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Video Feedback Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so uhm Couple of notes here. I saw your video the first thing is I don&#39;t remember we may have talked about combining this as one task But given the scope of all the things that are involved I rather us make this as a separate task where we are getting this first part and uhm the administrative
flag functionality added uhm and let&#39;s put that in and for the second part which is the accepted uhm we could add uhm this setting uhm and then it&#39;ll show up at the bottom I I actually I think when I we don&#39;t need really need this we can give everybody the ability to accept it because by default all
of this is going to come into the review page and then we can um say mark as accepted You&#39;re right.
I mean, I think I think it may cause Confusion for some users. So yeah, so we&#39;ll leave it what you have here And then have this checkbox As for the status I think if we can pick a different color That&#39;s less intense And purple I know we&#39;re probably running out of colors Yeah, I&#39;m uh Thinking so and and
what you said about the Completed being a confusing thing. I agree. We can say change that to submitted accepted all The other piece that I was thinking about is is it going to be clear?
What does it mean by viewed? viewed by who Maybe we can call it viewed by me You know, I&#39;m also wondering if there&#39;s a way that we can combine these two into one and it&#39;s all and it&#39;s uh unopened, opened, submitted and opened, and submitted and accepted.
No, no, submitted and uh, unopened. I think that may be too confusing. Another option is having these two here and then maybe a button or a checkbox Uhm, only show unopened because when you have it, when we have a drop down, technically from a UX standpoint, when we have drop downs with two or three
items, it shouldn&#39;t be a drop down. It should be a button. Like some sort of toggle button. Uhm, so if we say, show only unopened, and if they uncheck it, it&#39;s going to show everything.
Anyway, those are my thoughts. I know that it&#39;s not definite answers, uhm, but I agree with changing it. And then the other big thing is, uhm, if we can get this, this first task moved forward, since there&#39;s nothing to fix.
here, uhm, you may want to, uh, address this, well, let&#39;s not change status here as complete. If we want to change it to, uh, submitted, we&#39;ll want to, it&#39;s going to cause confusion if we do it in this task.
So let&#39;s first put this into to do and then we can come back and talk through this again.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/19d44f7f75834564a99ca14ef17429d2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning uh, Biple. So I&#39;m looking at this task and let me go to the key works and themes. What happens is?
This key works and themes does not show up sometimes for several seconds. Um. So you can see here it doesn&#39;t show up.
And this is with only three hundred and eighty six uh items. So that&#39;s one issue. Another one is um. For these method types.
instead of. It&#39;s, it&#39;s not very intuitive for us to um have this drop down filter this drop down like this because climb, I just don&#39;t know that if I&#39;m doing something here we don&#39;t have any other parts of the system that is doing this and I think when we designed this on this page it was done this way
and what I find it&#39;s very confusing so what, a better way to handle this is to put this as three different drop downs.
One for a list of instructional methods, another one for assessment methods, another one for resource types. So that if someone needs to pick one, they can go in there and choose the appropriate one.
An alternate way to do this is we&#39;ve used a butree select. And where we can expand and collapse the um the options.
This is, like this with uh obviously with check boxes like this. Um. You can see. Yeah like this. So that this would be instructional methods.
This would be assessment methods and resources. We can do this then that we can get away with one one uh drop down.
And it&#39;s also since we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna be touching this page. It would be good for us to apply that same logic here instead of repeating the keywords categories over and over.
We should use a category that&#39;s expandable and collapsible. Um, for keywords and for themes. Yeah, themes don&#39;t have category so it&#39;s fine to have it as one list.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ca2014349f71477d8acb144323bb35d9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m generating periodic aggregate normative data reports can be customized to AAVMC&#39;s requirements. this information can be collected. using a data warehouse.

We already support. The ability to obfuscate identify information and this is something that can be customized based on the needs.

And then once you have that set up, you also want to add Zoom app to your Google Calendar. Once you go, to the calendar, you click the little plus button and add it so that when you&#39;re creating an event from Google Calendar, you could uhm choose Zoom and it&#39;ll schedule the meeting with all the links
included. And whenever we are scheduling a meeting, we want to you, we do the, if it&#39;s the first meeting with them, we always do metrics consultation with and the institution name.
So you can see here, this is one I scheduled this morning and it includes uhm, it includes That the name of the, uh, The, uh, the school and then metric consultation, otherwise, if it&#39;s a regular follow-up meeting, we can say metrics meeting, uh, but it always has metrics meeting or metrics consultation
before it and the width and the institution name. The other thing that I wanted to mention is, in the opportunities, uh, we have some old pipelines here that says cold, warm, qualifying, um, these are some of the individuals that we spoke to in the past, um, that we may be able to pick up the conversations
, especially the warm ones, um, you know, as we get, as you get more comfortable in there, these are places that we can review to see what, what we can resurrect and bring them back to, into the conversation.
Yeah, so I wanted to send you this information so you have, um, this set up to go and then as we have meetings that we need to schedule, um, you&#39;re able to help with that.
And then for the pre, uh, the day before the demo, we always want to send them a reminder email, um, reminding them of what the agenda will be.
Um, we can, we typically send that as a, um, so for example, we have a meeting with WM Carey on May 22nd, um, the day before the meeting, we want to send them a reminder saying we&#39;re looking forward to meeting with you and this is what we&#39;ll be covering during the meeting.
And then the day afterwards, we want to send them a summary email highlighting the value that we&#39;re providing to them.
I haven&#39;t created a template for the pre-meeting yet. Um. Maybe what you can do is, um, do some research to see what organism, what companies are looking to typically send out and then create a template and I can go in there and modify.
It should be a very short email.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1e46a8cc88eb4cee90bbdd4747d8f1bd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Suggestions for USC Meeting</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, when you speak to USC, I wanted to share some suggestions to run through the The first thing I usually like to do is ask them what they, since the last meeting, what questions they have, do they have a chance to think about the pricing, and if they have any thoughts on where they need to be at
, and let him talk. And then afterwards, you can also, you can do a recap of the different uhm things that we said we can cover, have a bullet point ready to run through so that he&#39;s remembering all the valuable things that we can do for them, and maybe even have a tab open where you can show him the
system so that it, it uh refreshes his memory on what metrics looks like. And then going into the proposal, I usually go down the page one by one saying this is the page where kind of outlines all the different things that we do.
Also gives them a chance to see the big names that we have. Then our implementation, I don&#39;t really go through this one by one.
I simply say that it is a extended onboarding where we meet with them um for a series of meetings. And in this particular instance, we&#39;re going to be doing a um onboarding for about four weeks.
We want to kind of cap this off given the size and say we&#39;re going to do four weekly meetings and during this pace we&#39;ll be uh reviewing their requirements, giving them a plan on how to set up the system, and going over different um templates they can use to import the data.
And then we can adjust this one to, I&#39;m gonna do that right now, we&#39;ll set this as one month. And then here, uhm, we have a 10 hours, and it&#39;s updated for the modules that they have.
And we can say these are the modules, and you also want to review what we removed. So he knows that this is why we got the lower cost.
So we&#39;re saying that we&#39;re not going to include the live chat and some of the modules, but they can use email and calls and later on we can do it, we can give them the live chat as a courtesy, but it&#39;s not part of the subscription.
And uh, you know, ask him if this is something that will work for them, and if he&#39;s okay he needs to take it back, you know, when would be a good time for us to have a follow-up meeting to finalize it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/13a37c3d83e0480da64d9403c33ab406</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Metrix takes confidentiality and privacy very seriously, starting with all data entered into the platform is owned by the owned by the client, and our company does not place any ownership on the data.
Metrix also includes uh ehm Metrix is a FERPA-compliant platform, and student data is only made available to individuals who require access.
Metrix also provides tools for confidential feedback collection. For example, if students are asked to leave to evaluate their educators, or program, or rotation, their identifying information is automatically hidden from all users, so that there is no, they are not penalized for providing honest feedback
. This information, uh this, this automated confidentiality management makes it easy to collect feedback across the organization. Additionally, for aggregate data management for a AVMC, metrics can obfuscate identifying information so that data is collected without specific names and other information
. So, uh this can be customized based on AAVMC requirements. We would work with your team to understand your confidentiality needs and then structure the platform to handle the data accordingly.

So, for example, if you&#39;re building an integration to connect student data together with another platform, the API documentation would include instructions on which API endpoints to connect to and how to make those uh uhm requests to send the data, send and receive the data.
Additionally, um after implementation, Metrix onboarding team can collaborate with AAVMC to create more. training materials and documentation for AAVMC learners and educators.
Our knowledge base is integrated with our team. and includes an AI uhm interface that allows our users to ask questions in natural language and have a customized response.

However, there are components of this that can be used in the system.
For example, we have a projects module that can be used to collect used to manage projects such as research projects, quality improvement projects, all within metrics.
This allows individuals to add their peers or faculty members and collaborate by assign, creating tasks, comments, attachments, um so that they can collaborate with each other and get through those projects.
We can also create announcements, group announce, uh administrators can send out group announcements. Create events, and also share photos within the resources section.
Evaluations and forms can be created to collect feedback such as votes or polls. However, this has to be sent out via an administrator.
It&#39;s not something that is powered by a specific student or faculty member unless they have administrative privileges. In the future, we are planning on adding discussion boards similar to way that similar to what other LMS platforms have.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8c180375a40f4202a0e98be3dae0701a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Financial Reports and Exporting CSVs</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alejandro, so under reports, going to financials, transaction history, we go here.

So metrics provides standard onboarding trading as part of our implementation.
This includes training for administrative staff and other leadership members and it can be held over a period of time so that there&#39;s time to digest the information.
Um, it can be done in it. In addition to these administrative trainings that are done over zoom or in person, we also provide on demand training for all other types of users and this can be customized to the organization.
We can self learning is also possible using our video videos and articles that are in our knowledge base. And if AAMT, A-V-A-V-M-C wants to create.
Uhh, uh, customize training modules and track the completion of these modules. That can also be uhh, uhh, uhh, um, created as part of a customized onboarding experience.
Thank you know, metrics includes a requirements module which allows organizations to define set of a task to complete and track the completion of those tasks which may be used for tracking a user&#39;s online training.
As far as uh overall training strategy we believe in providing in from information over a period of time instead of very long training sessions so that users have the ability to digest that information and also believe in simulated training for administrative staff we provide a training environment that
can be used to practice completing to a certain task and master the tool.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/feb05f9a94ff4e6f88feb1711d2cb794</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>For this challenge, AAVMC needs to have a company and platform that would allow them use and to build out customized collection and roof.
Um, that can be scaled. It is a given the large scale goals as well as the Uhh novel competencies. It is going to be difficult to find a platform that has all of the analytics and reports that A-A-B-M-C needs.
What? Umm, it is important to make sure that a platform is selected with an open architecture that allows the tool to scale and more importantly working with a company with a leadership teams that are willing to partner with a VMC to build more capabilities and have keep additional integrations with
tools like Power BI and Tableau which allows more robust analytics to be built quickly and experimented with um as the academic needs evolve.
metric solution allows organizations like AAVMC to work with us as a partner. to build out custom integrations with tools like Power BI and Tableau to build dashboards and sync with different servers and continuously expand on that.
Our team also supports data warehousing for large scale syncing of data which can be used for more advanced analytics. They&#39;ve also have years of experience building custom reports and dashboards and can be a partner in health.

It&#39;s important to have one platform that they can use to manage their academic journey. This includes looking at their schedules, including schedule changes, looking at their evaluations, and see what was done for them by other preceptors and educators.
They also want to be able to complete evaluations in one place. So they don&#39;t want to be able to have to go through multiple platforms to get what they need.
The second thing is security and privacy. They want to make sure that their data is protected and is not being shared by others who shouldn&#39;t see that.
And metrics. The solution that we offer is that metrics is a all-in-one platform that can be used by training programs to do everything from onboarding to scheduling to evaluations to case logs.
in one place. The students can just manage everything in in there. Second is that metrics is for compliant and we make sure that data is only accessible to individuals that need to have access and we backup all the data every eight hours, which will ensure that the data is never lost.
So by keeping the data secure and private, we and and and much more. Students also want to have an ease of use when it coming and they don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time clicking around.
So Metrix is a visually engaging platform that is mobile and web optimized so that everybody can get their tasks done quickly.
without having to click around a bunch of menus.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c0832a0c4acf43fda692a9f087dccfcb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>First section called description of proposed solutions, including technology platform, we&#39;re going to tell AAVMC recommendations on how to solve this problem and what we what we can provide.
Initially and then the first part I want to start off with us creating a section that shows that list out the goals for each of their stakeholders.
So there&#39;s stakeholders uh include. The leadership team at each of these training programs, their goals are to make sure, umm, for them to have the buy-in to adopt a program like this.
They need to make sure that they are, they have the autonomy, each school has the autonomy to run their daily operations as they say fit and did it not feel as though this is a software tool that is used.
Use to monitor all day-to-day operations and feels like big brother is watching them. that if they don&#39;t feel the autonomy and privacy that to run the daily operations, A, B, M, C, we&#39;ll have a challenging.
getting the buy-in. Second stakeholder is A, A, B, M, C. For A, B, M, C, um, the goals are to ensure that there is standardization across the country.
Globally and that each of these training programs are collecting um data in a standardized format that is aligned with the milestones and able to collect this data seamlessly from all of these.
Um, institutions um and have comparable data. Um, it is also important to um ensure that there is um uh training programs and other materials provided to these uh to the leadership teams as well as trainees and faculty members.
So that there is um, increase engagement and also show value of this this program. This uh and this um um milestones.
The next stakeholder is the vendor which is would be us as a company. Um the priority for us is to ensure that um it is a deployment of the software.
That can be standardized and supported at scale. Um we want to make sure that it is something that is not to customize to each program.
Um but it also it uh. The next stakeholder is the faculty member and the faculty members and clinical educators. These educators and faculty members need to have a very easy to use tool that does not require a lot of training and a lot of clicking to get things done.
The next stakeholder is a student. For students they need to have real-time visibility into the information, be able to see their schedules, be able to get things done quickly and also be confident that their information is protected.
And once we have these goals outlined then we&#39;re going to talk about how metrics helps. Umm, solve each of these challenges.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3daef02c00fb4f7eba385a13e47b048a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>In this question, we&#39;re going to answer description of proposed solution, including technology platform. Given AAVMC&#39;s goal of implementing this tool across various veterinary training programs globally, it is important to provide a- uh software to the platform that can be standardized across all these
institutions while also giving each institution the autonomy to run their own operations. It can, It needs to be a tool that does not feel uh in order to ensure and in order to make sure that there is buying from the schools, the leadership of each of these training programs it must, the software must
operate in a way that, that each training program can fully control and manage their operations in the platform while also control how and when data is reported to the AVMC.
It should not feel as though Big Brother is watching and monitoring every day-to-day operation, uhh uhh uhh everything that&#39;s happening on a day-to-day basis at that organization.
This is the type of support. This is the type of implementation that- metrics can help AAMC with. We envision a- we- metrics include- this is- these are what we provide.
Metrics includes a large enterprise platform that can be used. By organizations to manage everything including onboarding of trainees, faculty members, preceptors, clinical educators, each of them with their own profile and on their demographic information.
The hospitals that they are going to uh we can collect uh for each site various demographic information.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/efa712b5b55844399f58dd07ea2a7386</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>This next question ask about providing examples of similar technology solutions offered at other professions organizations. We&#39;re going uh to respond to this we&#39;re going to.
Break it up into three case studies. In the first example we&#39;re going to talk about management for ACGME. Metrics was founded in 2013 when the accreditation council of creation council of graduate medical education of the ACGME implemented milestones for all the medical, the human medicine residency
and fellowship programs are initial. The company was founded for the sake of streamlining the management of milestones. Over the first five years of the company we extensively built out tools and dashboards and processes to help.
residency programs and foster programs collect meaningful data from their faculty members to prepare a um longitudinal view of their trainees and how they are progressing through the milestones.
This allowed us to build out um custom reports like the clinical competency community report that allows the uh the program director and the committee of core faculty members who meet every six months during review each trainees performance and report to the ACGME similar to the way that a a VMC is looking
to do. Although we did not provide a platform directly to the ACGME, many hospitals and residency programs have used metrics to manage the milestones for each of their trainees.
Uh, this includes Kaiser Permanente, Northern California. Uh, it&#39;s our largest to play. I&#39;m in of metrics for residency programs across all of their Northern California hospitals.
Our seamless process allows them to collect this information and report it. The second case study is Purdue University&#39;s College of Veterinary Medicine.
The leadership team at Purdue reached out to us to help. of implement the milestones for their vet program and the platform which was built initially for ACGME was utilized to implement a milestone base.
It&#39;s the evaluation system and then also generate the reports necessary for the organization which aligned with AABMC and CBBE. Thank you.
This was a pilot implement at this the university&#39;s use it as a pilot implementation. Um. And we work with the doctor, Jim Wiseman and Kathy.
Thank you. The deans of the school. The third case study we will. Talk about is Lincoln Memorial University College of Veterinary Medicine.
The school approached us to manage all of their operations, things include scheduling of the students to a distributed clinical sites across the country where they have.
We have clinical preceptors working with students in completing evaluations. We deployed metrics with automated tools that allows them to generate schedules for all the students based on their availability and preferences.
Then metrics was utilized to deliver these evaluations that are competency based to students across the clinical sites and then our clinical competency committee was used by the program by the dean and the administrative staff to review the student&#39;s performance.
They said that this was one of the most powerful tools they have seen and that it gives them everything that they need.
Metrics was also used at Umm. Purdue and LMU College of Veterinary Medicine. And, to collect case logs and procedures that they have completed and making sure that they&#39;re met the minimum requirements.
So as you can see we have uh extensive experience in administering competency based uh. Competency management as well as um managing the operations of a uh veterinary college.
Given that our platform is standardized and each of these schools are using this same uh tool then allows us to deliver uh reports to a abmc um on a without additional workload for these colleges.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/01d13d97e8c749fcabb8a704a277414e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2024RFP_CBVEITRE - Google Docs - 7 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>metrics provides enterprise level support for all of our clients it&#39;s um our services include comprehensive onboarding live training including on site training process development, custom development, dairware housing, data migration and customer success to go into each of these for all of our clients

The onboarding plan also includes a project management team that includes dedicated project lead, online tracking of action items and completions as well as training materials and videos.
At the end of the comprehensive onboarding, we also do live training for any key. Administrators and this can also be structured as an on-site training with an in a simulation training environment.
After onboarding, we have customer success and customer support teams taking. Over for customer support, we provide support through live chat that&#39;s built into the team into the platform that allows any of our administrators to reach out to us.

Each of our clients are experienced provided a monthly webinar through customer success. We review certain functionality as well as answer questions on new features that was released.
Metrics also provides umm more technical. Uhh, enterprise support such as ability to have a data warehousing server. This allows enterprise clients to sync directly with Metrics database and pull large volumes of data for into their data warehouse.
We also provide REST API framework for sync. We provide custom development for certain modules that are unique to our and operational needs of the organization.

This is a touch for metrics and I wanted to create a short video going over this proposal. few things in the beginning that summarizes our company and our.
product and the modules that are that metrics offers, skip down to the pricing section. And this page here outlines our support.
And this first table here, summarize. This is the additional modules to handle the third and fourth year students. This is meant to be a set of modules that would replace what is currently being handled to revalue.
We also included the ability to. Handle uh elective applications and then for 120 students and there&#39;s a one year implementation fee and after the first year the renewal will be at 19 200.
This is a separate agreement to the curriculum module that we already have. If you go down here this is for the faculty credential management essentially for managing their profiles with all the documents that they need.
And also to be able to monitor compliance with those documents. And this actually we do not need a separate implementation for that.
We will be covering that as part of this. And down here. We&#39;ve listed out what the cost would look like if we handle all four years of training.
So you have it for a future planning if you&#39;re interested in doing a more comprehensive migration. So for example, this includes scheduling for the first and second year students classroom based training.
It also includes the MSPE module and automation of those letter generators. If metrics is purchased as a uhh uhh for all four years.
These modules at the top has per student licensing and these modules at the bottom they&#39;re affixed rate for the school to use it as an administrative tools to manage the curriculum or to generate the MSPE letters for the students that are graduating.
And it would also have an implementation cost mainly for the MSPE if that&#39;s done at a later time. And the for the current.
The curriculum module currently this school is grandfathering into a price based on our previous pricing model. We would maintain that.
And that&#39;s why there&#39;s a discount applied here. Um, because. So, I have been with us for a while. We&#39;re not increasing the rate to our current rate.
We&#39;ll be maintaining the curriculum rate that you currently paying. So, please let us know if you have any questions. And, I would recommend us work.
Working towards the clinical modules and we can get this started pretty quickly and also work out the invoicing so that it&#39;s paid with this licensing start date for July 4th.
Or whenever they current uh contract ends so that way the budget can be applied for that next year of I could put next year of renewal so there&#39;s no there&#39;s no need for an overlapping period of uh billing.
Thank you. That&#39;s a good one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/729ca1d53ae6449282e0f0541221b521</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 15 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Happy match day everyone. I hope uh all of your programs filled all of the spots and uh uh are excited to onboard your new trainees.
I wanted to share this short video to give you some tips on how to create these new residents in your program.
As you know, metrics provides a integration with URAS which you can access from the system setup and integrations page. And on this page you already uh from last year you may already have the ACJME program code all set up and then you can go in there and click the retrieve trainees to pull in all of
your new residents. If for some reason it&#39;s not set up and you need to do um, enter all the institutional Thank you.
Uh configuration and program ID and you have a questions about that. You can reach out to our support team. If it&#39;s if it is configured and you simply need to set up all the residents as will start in the e-rest platform.
You can click on this view instructions button and we&#39;ll provide you with a document that explains how to do that.
Once all of the trainees are retrieved, you&#39;ll see the trainee count here. In this example we have two total trainees and I can select one and see all of the data that&#39;s coming in.
Before you go ahead and create the metrics account for this user, it&#39;s best if you go into the system and check if this user already has an existing account.
So if you go into this page and copy the trainees first and last name, go to and search for the user you want to confirm that this person wasn&#39;t there as a student in your program and you can also search the entire institution by clicking the affiliate people with the two program option at the top right
. This will search the entire organization and make sure you don&#39;t have a account that was used as a student or if you&#39;re in a fellowship program that this trainee wasn&#39;t there as a resident.
Once you have confirmed that account doesn&#39;t exist then you can go into system setup integrations again and create the new account.
So to create the new account you want to review all these fields make changes to the email address if you need to and if there&#39;s something you don&#39;t want to import you can uncheck it.
When you get to the medical school section you want to select the appropriate medical school from this drop down. When you get to the GME make sure you set up the appropriate GME program.
And if you have more than one GME program getting pulled in from e-rass it&#39;ll all show up on- different sections here.
And once that&#39;s all done you want to select the class of year the home institution which is going to be the the site where this training is going to be working.
The role is going to be the incoming resident or incoming fellow depending on your institution and choose the activation date.
This is going to be the date that the trainee is allowed to log into metrics and click the create trainee account.
This will create a brand new trainee account in metrics with all of this information filled out. If you have an existing account in metrics as a student account in order instead of importing from e-rass is best to update that trainee account to a um to the next role.
So if they&#39;re a medical student you can advance them into a resident role. If they&#39;re resident they can be advanced to fellow.
The only thing is that if they&#39;re currently doing a training at your institution as a in a residency program you don&#39;t want to do that advancement right now because they&#39;re going to need to finish their training until the end of June and you would want to advance them at the end of the academic year.
If for some reason umm you have a duplicate account this is something that you can reach out to our support team and we can help you merge those accounts together.
This is something that has to be done from our end. Umm, it&#39;s best to avoid creation of these duplicates. If it if it already happened and you need us to help merge them we can do that more end.
Again. We&#39;re always here to help you and if you have any questions please reach out. Otherwise, uhm, best of luck with all of the onboarding and getting all these residents up to speed as they get started as physicians at your institution.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dcca8c717469428992dae1c022d3ae50</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Conversations History | Medtrics Lab - Real | Close - 15 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning everyone.

What they&#39;re likely to do is pick a course and pull in all the course objectives. So it&#39;s better if we list out the courses and let them pick courses for that.
And then down here session objectives we can do the same thing instead of listening out every single session. We could um list out the courses and if there&#39;s a way for us to yeah I think if we lift out the courses then we can we know that when they click the course they&#39;re gonna get an export of all
the sessions for that course we can. We can say anatomy 101 and then dash 25 sessions. That will be much easier to work with and it also provides them with context right now.
That doesn&#39;t know what, we don&#39;t know what course this belongs to. And when we do export it, we are getting, Uhh, let&#39;s see.
Let&#39;s do this here. Thank you. Hahaha. Thank you. Getting this export, it would be ideal if we get rid of these zeros and show the numbers as it&#39;s very hard to scroll through this and find the numbers with all these zeros in here.
And for the total rows, if we add some sort of shading to it. Let&#39;s see. Umm. Where did you go?
Katie hurt me. Where are we looking? Yeah. Why? Uhh. I&#39;ll tell you one second. C-A-G-U-A So if we apply some sort of light gray shading like we do for the first column, then it&#39;s easier for to scroll down and see these totals.
Right now when you look scrolling down, it&#39;s difficult to see separation between the content. So essentially, adding the um adding the uh the formatting.
So it&#39;s, it has a shading removing the zeros and for these headers if we use an Excel export and make this wrap text so that it&#39;s short it, this doesn&#39;t take up as much, space and it also becomes a little easier to manage because this is a very powerful report I think if we can make it a little more,
user friendly, clients will appreciate that.

It&#39;s bread and butter of what we do, it&#39;s a, uh metrics is built from the ground up for the four years of medical education management and since everybody here is focused on the clinical side and student affairs, I&#39;ll go through a, uh, a a tour of the system, uhm, again my, as an introduction, my name
is Santosh, I started this company 11 years ago as a fourth year medical student, now I&#39;m an emergency radiologist at Temple, uh, in Philadelphia, so, uhm, part of my life is being, working with patients.
With residents that emerge at a, at a hospital, so I, but I&#39;ve been through the medical school journey, the rest, the five years of residency journey, so, uhm, and one of the things that as a, as a, as a team, we focus really on is on usability.
Cause if it&#39;s not usable for the students and the faculty members, you&#39;re not going to get the data that you need, cause you as administrators and deans and professors are, you&#39;re going in there to get data out of the system, but the people that are putting the data in, are your trainees and your faculty
members and your preceptors. So a lot of our work is focused on making that user friendly, uhm, and we do all four years of education management, uhm, this includes onboarding them, you know, your immunization, your immunization records, your HIPAA certification, you can collect all that and put it in
the system and have it available for this, for your clinical hospitals. The other piece is scheduling. You can schedule all of the rotations for all, uh, third year and fourth year.
And also keep track of whether they met the minimum requirements for those third and fourth year, because everybody needs to do X number of weeks of surgical elective, medical electives.
Uhm, and all of the evaluations can also be automated. Based on the schedules. So if you know that an attending is going to be covering there, it can be automatically distributed.
But if you don&#39;t know that, you can let the students request an evaluation from the person that is going to be covering.
Uhm, and then. When it, when the case logs students can get that dashboard where they see what required or take a diagnosis and electives they have to complete and log it, and at the end of all of this, it feeds into the MSPE letter.
How are you generating your MSPE letters now? Okay, basically most. Most of the data is, is received from different areas.
So the register we have SONEST from GENSEBAR, so they, that gives us all the uhm data that it&#39;s regard to when they entered, if they have any.
absent, at renovation day, etc. Then uhm, the preclinical years usually we use also SONEST in regards to the grading, so we know their professional grade.
But professionalism comes from Excel because professional, okay, it just kind of explains. Faculty uploads the grades in Canvas, okay. But professionalism which is, I&#39;m not talking about the course, but the calendar is not uploaded right now in Canvas and it&#39;s not uploaded in saw this, so the committee
meets the next whole sheet with the grading and the comments. I&#39;m sure our understanding is that as to like the competency of professionals?
Yes. Okay. Yes, because in our curriculum, besides the course of professionalism, we have professionalism as a component that we see that.
How they carry themselves? Yes. Um, and obviously it&#39;s, it&#39;s, but it&#39;s important for the first two years, I mean, it&#39;s really important for me already, um, you know, in the evaluation.
Yeah. Just come back. Thank you. Thank you for receiving that on Excel sheet. Yes. Yes. So we have a committee, so the committee receives professionalism and an Excel sheet, so they enter that data.
We have a template that um, so we just go with the We each department or each office enters the information.
So Redley Straw provides that information with those on us which comes in automatically. Um, we&#39;re working to see if science could kind of we were trying to see if science could integrate everything and have a fuller template.
Um, which is one of our goals. Um, so we have all that data pretty clinically but. Um, the comes through um, son is, um, professionalism comes through excel sheet, then we go through clinicals so clinical comes through e-value.
So what we were trying to do is um, import data from the value. I don&#39;t report from the value to son is, so that son is can have it and add it to its full template and there we get the rotation, the side, the date, um, the comment, the grade, the comments and everything.
So then we finish all of it. And then the last component which is the summary usually goes to our learning assessment process.
So usually what it does is we use metrics and and other programs to seek the components for each. Umm, competency and then provide the graphic in regards to how that student performs with their forward.
So see technically that&#39;s why it&#39;s a committee and then obviously we include in our time is to eat two appendix that are not required but we include it because those are things that has been pushed us at the school which is community service and research.
And so research can be a struggle too because we don&#39;t have to. We have to capture the name of the project and the status and the comments usually when we see just a grade for research.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1bc19f644f084c3dbb01997518c41e7c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Oliv : Meeting details - 15 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys, this is that AI tool that joined the meeting this morning and I don&#39;t want to use this tool because it&#39;s it&#39;s something that got released recently and it looks like it&#39;s uh it&#39;s still going through early development and I&#39;m happy with the tension so the goal for me to kind of learn from what
they&#39;re doing and see if we can um do some AI prompts that will allow us to get similar. Thank you.
Um so for example like a it gives me a list of my upcoming meetings and also sends me summaries. Um and then when I open up the.
The prospect. It gives me um at the end of the meeting I have key takeaways. Uh their key takeaway. And uh next steps.
Their next step. And you got that booty correctly here. List of things. Umm. And then the on the right side we have.
Umm. This is the things that I found useful like the current process. Um. Text stack. Decision make a decision process, timeline, buying committee, and they also have some useful things in templates, meetings, sales meeting, you have review of the umm so what what to do it before the meeting.
So review account. And then you can see um like this was the most useful thing I found in here and I wanted to see if we can pull some of these things.
So when you prepare for the meeting review the companies. Linked in profile. Check the company news. Check the website. Umm.
When we review the contact check their linked in profile. Send them a warm warm up email. Thank you which umm, I think they had a template for.
And then during the meeting build Um, and they have standardized questions that allow us to uh, kind of based on what we researched set expectations.
I&#39;ll guys next time. Check on time. So each of these cards have been created by them already and what I was thinking we can do is and I&#39;ll pull some of these things into a Google document.
But one of, one of the things that I would like you guys to experiment with is in attention. Again. We have, they have something called talk tracks that we haven&#39;t been using.
And it allows us to have a predefined list of talking points and they. You have an Iowa, I mean a Mac and Mac application.
I think they also have windows that you can run on your desktop and as you&#39;re asking questions you&#39;ll see this on the screen and then when you hit those topics it&#39;ll check them off as you&#39;ve done that.
So. This company has put that into the system directly for attention. They don&#39;t have it pre-made. Um. And but I but I since these company has.
Done it. I was thinking that we can pull some of this and um. Use it. So validate buying intent. So for example this one was really good.
And I actually use this today like authority. What is that? Uh typical decision making process. Who else should be included in this?
Do you have a budget for it? Umm. And the nice thing about having it as a talk track is it will show on the screen for us to go through without the client seeing it and then once you are saying it it will uh mark it off and ensure that we&#39;re always consistent with our our how we start off these calls</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/81aa63c371c44c098c3b42289a622e66</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Learner Management System RFI.docx - Google Docs - 13 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon Dan and Jennifer. I wanted to share this video to explain the pricing model and also talk about the long-term impact.
When it comes to metrics, the core goal would be to centralize everybody in one platform so that not only can you operationalize the scheduling and evaluations more efficiently, but also work towards this long-term goal of keeping those students as staff when they graduate.
And in the RFI, I had shared a roadmap item that we have planned, which is the Career Center. Essentially, it would be a page in Metrix that would allow the Recruitment Office to share jobs that are available at your institution.
Uh, this particular screenshot is showing different institutions, but each hospital can essentially, Let&#39;s say we only want to show jobs from our institution, and then every time a student is going into the platform, they&#39;re able to see available jobs and then directly connect with the Recruitment Office
. This is something that, I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time during our demo because it was, that was more focused on the current needs.
What you can accomplish with this is essentially reduce the number of external recruits and thereby decreasing the cost of that.
And in the new pricing model, I kind of accounted for this. If there&#39;s an interest in Gundersen to work with us in developing this, it would help Gundersen create that pipeline of students coming and applying for those jobs.
And for us, we&#39;re also finding it as a benefit to work with a health system like GHS and Bellin to um to develop with this and ensure that it is user-friendly.
So with that in mind, there&#39;s two pricing here. We modified the student side. Essentially, the main thing that we adjusted is evaluations.
The students don&#39;t need to have competency management. So, we cut the cost of that since uh it&#39;s not it&#39;s gonna be same survey being sent out for the students is not gonna be milestones management like the residents.
The second piece here is um um trainees that are there for shorter periods of time. We we don&#39;t want to cut this into one week or two week, but I think we can do it as a two type of accounts.
One for trainees that are less than six months, it would cost half the cost, half the fee, and then anyone that&#39;s more than six would cost a full fee.
Um at the end of the first year, if we wanna revisit this and make adjustments, we can um in terms of um um whether or not the six months is the best.
cut off um for the volume of students you have. And then, so the total would be 141,620 here. And if Gunderson is willing to partner with us in developing this job board, we can also include this strategic client discount and this would bring the cost below $100,000 and allow you to ease into the the
full platform and roll out this career center once the full initial onboarding is done. So by the time year three comes, you have the platform established across all of the programs and you also have a pipeline created where the career center is delivering those jobs to the students.
And you know that that is going to be tremendous value for the recruitment office and potentially there&#39;s even an opportunity for part of this budget to be covered.
from the recruitment side. And then for the residents, it&#39;s staying the same. So please let me know what your thoughts are on this.
This is something that uhm is is uh Custom created for Gunderson and hopefully will better align with your budget. One thing that we&#39;re not willing to do is do the pricing model where the students are paying for the fee.
It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve never done and it also doesn&#39;t uh Sit well with the students when they&#39;re already paying a tuition and they have to pay an extra fee To use a software for one of the one or two of the rotations It&#39;s a it would be a better model for the institution to provide the platform.
So they&#39;re having that better experience and they&#39;re coming back and wanting to stay there as a staff member.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e1000b0d8e50476cb14e9e95f0054d23</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So this report on the um faculty portal curriculum time-spet report when I select criteria. If I go to the by individual drop down I don&#39;t- I&#39;m not able to select anyone.
I should be able to uh select. Umm. Individuals that are part of my um the course that I have permission to.
So if anyone is- if anyone is linked to sessions in the courses that I have access to, they should be available to select here.
But if- if that is going to slow down the drop down, we can list out all of the different faculty user types.
And then when they select it, they would- the data would always show the courses that I have permission to do access.
on. So by course tab, I can select a course that I have access to, but when I look at the report, this chart looks like it was never finished.
And. I&#39;m not able to see like you have flip classroom here and I&#39;m not really seeing that getting updated at the top.
And the other thing that I&#39;m noticing is we&#39;re not showing all of the sessions. so has more sessions here that do not have dates and we&#39;re not showing that here.
And this table also, this calculation up here appears to be hard coded because there is no such thing as lab in lab session type.
It should be showing the different types of sessions and updating it here. And anything that doesn&#39;t have dates.

That means when I click back here it goes to this weird page that has nothing to do with this report.
We need to take them back to this page where they can see the reports, you see where it&#39;s going to.
Yeah, it&#39;s going to slash reports instead of slash reports slash curriculum. And instead of slash curriculum slash reports. The other thing to note here is we have on different pages the switch program be a button.
If there&#39;s only one program we don&#39;t need to show this everywhere. Because it it introduces confusion and if it&#39;s a person that has access to more than one.
Umm actually let&#39;s we can handle that enough in a separate task. Let&#39;s uh tackle the permissions on this report.

And having been involved with the AI research through our company and outside for the last couple of years, I was a little taken aback.
by what they&#39;re offering in terms of being able to extract everything automatically. I wanted to recommend that you try out the output and confirm with the faculty that it is usable, the content, um and that it&#39;s going to be something that can be reused year after year.
Because if it&#39;s being extracted from a PowerPoint or lecture that has already happened, it&#39;s a retrospective analysis of the curriculum.
From what you described, it sounds like you&#39;re revamping the curriculum and creating something new. Is the retrospective analysis going to give you the information that you need to map out the curriculum and the way that it should be?
So that&#39;s something that I strongly recommend seeing an output and from a few of the courses and maybe doing a paid pilot so that you can see the results and faculty can look at it and make sure it is usable.
I also wanted to share. At our company, we&#39;ve been using ChatGPT quite a bit for various projects, including our development team uses it for various documentation and with the paid version of ChatGPT you can do a lot of this analysis uhm automatically.
So for example, this particular lecture is something that I created years ago when I was in residency. Let me see if I can pull that up as a, it&#39;s a topic that covers endocrinology from a radiology perspective.
And I attached this pdf here, I can tell CHAT GPT. So, with this uhm approach, essentially it can generate the objectives for this and also create keywords.
And we can, you can also use this to give the course objectives and see what kind of uhm alignment it can create.
So, so this kind of extraction is uh possible using ChatGPT. And um the the challenge with this type of automation is each time it&#39;s done it will be different.
And being able to standardize this and make it repeatable over year after year, um and you know, what is the, what is, what should the curriculum be?
Uh and uh the ideal objectives and the next then being able to map that, once you have that, then something like this may be helpful where you can look at the objectives that was extracted from the document and seeing if it aligns with an existing uhm set of objectives.
Same thing with keywords. Once you have a standardized set of keywords, you can also extract the keywords and then connect that.
So it is something that that can be done using ChatGPT and I recommend comparing what the output is from this tool and make sure that it is something that is going to be usable and I am very optimistic about it.
It is something that I hope they solve the challenge, but it seems like a tool that can automatically extract data often ends up with large amounts of output text that the faculty will then have to read and clean up.
So the question is going to be whether is it going to be faster to clean up an output or is it going to be faster to prepare what the ideal objectives should be and then use a tool like that to analyze whether the objectives are being met in the lecture.
I hope this is helpful. I wanted to give you these thoughts as you evaluate the platform and if you would like us to schedule a call with the rest of the team for the other parts of the system, feel free to reach out.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ca1e6185292a4d03be262bc6ff672781</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 April 2024</pre></td><td><pre>In this short video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to set up the excuse to absence functionality metrics. So under schedules, rotations, we go to our rotation, click Edit, and there is an option here that says excuse this individual from conferences and other events.
If I enable this, when a resident is invited to an calendar event, they will be automatically marked as excused. If they&#39;re scheduled to the rotation on the block schedule.
So let&#39;s go to a calendar event, create this event, and if I invite residents, and if a P.G.Y. I want residents scheduled to this uhm excused rotation, they&#39;ll be marked as excused.
But if we want to override that and also make this a mandatory If we for all residents, we can turn on this checkbox which means that even the residents that are on excused rotations will be marked as absent if they do not attend this event.
remember that attendance is taken using a QR code that can be scanned. Or it can be manually updated directly on the log attendance page.
The key thing to keep in the key thing here is this setting is on the rotation and if they&#39;re scheduled to that particular excuse for its rotation, they will be marked as excuse from all events during that um rotation started between the stortation start date and end date.
You cannot selectively say they are all the excuse from specific events on the calendar.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3e3740db686c45eeb290a8e915561b9c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (2077) - 12 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so when we set up a new client what are things that we want to do is go into uh, going to front and go to contacts and then create a new account and then we can define what their domain name is going to be.
And I think for LMU you can see if she has a different domain if not we may want to consolidate this into one account.
Because we have one for LMU. Actually what we can do is, um, associate. We can create a separate one for LMU d-com.
I&#39;ll do that right now. And she also uses LMU net.edu. Too many tabs. We&#39;ll see you next time. So it&#39;s already, Okay so I think what we need to do is, we named this to LMU.
So once we have that then we can create lists and for each of the projects that we do we have a one committee then we want to create a list that contains all the contacts for that.
So we create a list So, LMU. And then can add the contacts to have here. And you don&#39;t have to do this.
Um. can help you send that list over to Alejandra. She can help create this um for you each time. And the other thing that we want to do is look through. The settings in your account and make sure we have a few templates here.
So we have created that is under client onboarding that we can use when we send up summary emails and things like that.
Post kick off meeting summary. Thank you. So since we&#39;re going to using arrow we may want to customize this. Umm, you don&#39;t have to do all all this right now but I wanted to make you aware of what&#39;s in here if you want to use any of this.
So when we&#39;re sending out any email we can simply click. I&#39;ll let me do d-com m-s-p-e and I&#39;ll pick all of the contacts for that and insert it in there.
And you can also select templates. Thank you. And when we send an email, we want to always send it from help instead of your personal account and the contact list that we create.
should include their contacts as well as our contacts. so everything is going out from help so that if they respond it&#39;s coming into that help inbox.
um and it doesn&#39;t get siloed into any individuals inbox. that when we include our team members into the email list we&#39;re all getting CCed on it so everybody&#39;s aware of it even if they&#39;re not going into help.
so if you want whenever you respond. to Lisa if she if she emailed you directly you can always change the sender to help.
and later we can put in a rule that if it&#39;s getting sent to you. from uh Lisa it gets moved to the success folder.
so that it&#39;s separate from the normal support conversations.

Then we can define templates that uh that has these merge fields. So we can see the letter here first name last name and so on.
Don&#39;t wear the characteristics. Thanks. Once we have the templates we can also define charts and what are the different charts that we want to standardize.
These are charts that we can. Generate using the grades in the grade book. So charts allow us to specify what kind of colors we want to use, the x-axis labels, the y-axis labels and so on.
So we have the charts, the templates, Thank you. And once all of that is configured, we can bash generate MSPE letters.
So you can see here Deborah, if I were to preview this document or edit this document, all of the necessary information was inserted into this letter and those merge fields that are replaced with content.
And we can also make additional changes if we need to, such as changing the font, font size, and so on.
If I scroll down, I also start to see the letters have the charts inserted into the appropriate sections. These are dynamic charts that are getting created by metrics using the data in the system.
These are not images that the school has to upload. And the grades in the grade book is also something that captures both the free clinical as well as the clinical grades.
So we have rotation grades. This course grades. Metrics is usually not set up as the as the primary location where grades is stored that may be in the SIS system.
Metrics is often used as the central hub where students will see this information and then that those grades are used to generate the MSP letters.
And for rotation grades we also have the ability to include those comments that are coming in from those preceptors. So those comments can be pulled into the MSPE.
So that&#39;s a quick overview of the MSPE module. It takes about three months for us to set this up and automate it.
And once that setup is done and each year the school can generate the, these letters quickly.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e6b5968394244d1694221bb5797a27b2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leadership Mentorship - Google Docs - 4 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to share this document with you because this is something Chris and I went over in a call recently.
Essentially, this summarizes some of the ideas that I had for the leadership discussions. Again, these are just ideas and suggestions and it&#39;s essentially putting down some of the things that Chris is involved with in terms of leadership and things projects that he&#39;s taking over and hopefully these discussions
that you&#39;re having is aligned with those kind of initiatives. First thing here is Chamberlain&#39;s BSN onboarding. We need to make sure that we go live without delay and this is our largest project to date.
Atalem has already started planning out this project and they have a functional specs all written up. First thing that I recommended here was Jerry reviewing some of those key recordings with Atalem well the recordings of the meetings we had with Atalem and offering suggestions on how we may be able
to manage the client. By improving how we meet with them, you know, essentially, how do we set clear expectations for the client so that the projects stay on schedule, how do we effectively document things and delegate internally so that Chris is not the only person doing you know, that&#39;s how them work
, and that it&#39;s getting delegated so that team members know what the expectations are and have a deadline and it&#39;s all written down.
And also from a communication standpoint, given this is our largest client, in terms of number of students, I would like to be updated on these projects proactively so that I don&#39;t have to ask for what the updates are.
I&#39;d like to know context and essentially I&#39;m hoping that I can be hands off with the onboarding as much as possible as long as I&#39;m getting these updates and we know that we&#39;re maximizing the student experience and the faculty experience and they&#39;re going to end up happy with our progress and I need to
know context on how we&#39;re doing with the onboarding, not just the talent, but the experience of the end users because if implementation doesn&#39;t go well, then the students and the faculty members end up complaining later and then it&#39;s hard harder for us to rebuild our reputation and we we don&#39;t want to
do that with 6,000 students. For Atalum&#39;s MSPE this year, this is not an onboarding. This is more of a project.
They&#39;re they&#39;re starting to get this year&#39;s letters generated. Essentially, for this one how to how to plan out those development tasks for our product, our team, and effectively manage it internally to get these things done on time and then from an external perspective.
How to plan out these on these projects with the Talim over the next few months, so we don&#39;t run into the same delays we had the last two years.
So for this to happen, we had to be proactive with how we. Thank you. Bye-bye. Delegate and hold them accountable for things right from the beginning, and it starts with us setting that agenda, running the meetings with them, and then sending written action items so that next meeting they&#39;re coming prepared
with the items completed. These two items at the bottom essentially is more for internal Chris is leading a couple of meetings during the week, dev planning, test trigger meetings, and essentially how do we optimize those meetings so we&#39;re getting other team members engaged.
And also driving the action items so that things get done on time. Lastly proactive internal and external communication. I&#39;m going to delete this one, we&#39;ll just keep it at three.
Because some of these products of communication is already handled in these two items and I put together this communication strategy tip.
This is something I&#39;m adding into our handbook that I&#39;m putting together, but I wanted to copy this here, but I&#39;m sure, Jerry, you have other tools and that may work effectively equally well in proactively communicating updates to me and other team members of projects like the MSP.
Project or the BSN projects. This way, it&#39;s easy to be fully hands off or or and fully delegate from my end and not have to worry about the project as long as I&#39;m getting enough context on how things are going.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/16599e8c641040578c54d7886fb3bc98</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>All Messages | Medtrics | Intercom - 5 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike So on this let&#39;s see where&#39;s our yeah so for this one let&#39;s make Okay. edit this one here and go to the oh and we can remove this last webinar section because it&#39;s been a long time.

The evaluations module is something that our clients use to collect feedback on their trainees.
So in our system, when we log in, there are three admin portals. If we go to the regular program admin portal, which is just called admin, and go to evaluations and templates, we can create different types of forms.
So let&#39;s say I want to create a rotation form, and of course feedback, and then we can create different questions in here.
These are basically survey questions. And then go to the next page and we have these automation rules we can set up.
And one of the automation rules we can do is, so I want to say who&#39;s going to get evaluated, the people in the rotations.
These are the different courses or rotations that they offer. Who&#39;s going to complete the form, who will get evaluated. Should this be automatically assigned?
And I can, I can say no. And here&#39;s where we&#39;re going to make the change. So should evaluatees be allowed to request an evaluation?
Yes, then we can allow the request. And we&#39;re going to add a second checkbox here.

From both pages. So if I select a form, I can submit a request, and it&#39;ll, it&#39;ll tell me that. So let&#39;s say if I&#39;m making a request for this.
End of evaluation form, for pediatric rotation eval, for ghee, send some request. I can make another request. But now because the request is the same person and the same rotation, you can see that this is an assignment in the back end is called the user schedule table.
So this is a user that&#39;s scheduled to this rotation on the user schedule. He will not allow me to make the same request for the same evaluator.
What we&#39;re doing with this feature is adding a setting on the form itself, so they cannot make any requests That they cannot they can only make one request per form.
It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a different different faculty or not. So, if I go into pediatric and I choose a user schedule, I can only make one request.
I cannot choose a different faculty and submit the request because currently, you can do that. You can go in there and make one request and then choose a different faculty and make a second request.
The goal of this feature is to prevent that from happening so you can only make one request per form. And that would only happen if the checkbox is enabled.
And as for the error, we can show you the same error message that we have here. Evaluation has already been submitted.
Contact administrator to resend the eval request.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f36cad2692d14df79360cf4e6e55c20c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leadership Mentorship - Google Docs - 4 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Chris and Jerry. This is a document that Chris and I went over earlier in the in a meeting as part of our weekly one-on-ones.
I wanted to share this video and this document with both of you since you&#39;re meeting and discussing different leadership and communication strategies.
And as Chris gets more involved in managing team members, this set of discussions that both of you are having will be more effective in ensuring that you It&#39;s something that I need to run the company because I&#39;m not able to do this myself.
This document addresses two things from a client perspective and two things from the industry perspective. From a client perspective, the two major projects that Chris will be in charge of the is going to be the BSN onboarding and the MSPE onboarding.
Well, the Chamberlain BSN onboarding is going to be the largest project that we have ever done. This project has already been planned out by Atalem and they&#39;re about to kickstart it.
This means we have to be very proactive with how we manage their project. How we communicate with them and drive them towards a specific goal and try to anticipate potential problems they will have and then help them avoid it.
Because if we are not actively managing it. They&#39;re going to struggle with getting things done since they&#39;re not as familiar with metrics as we are So first step what I&#39;m thinking is Jerry to offer any feedback to Chris on some of the media meetings that have been we&#39;ve been recorded recording and strategies
on how to clear set expectations for the clients based on those calls, how to also effectively communicate and delegate projects to the metrics team members.
So it&#39;s not all Chris doing all the work, it&#39;s Chris managing it and then divvying up work internally as needed, whether it&#39;s data-related work or with development work, you know, ensuring that it&#39;s done early and in a written manner.
So it gets done with good quality, and then for my, for my uhm, for my end, essentially managing the communication to me so that I&#39;m getting regular updates proactively, and also giving me enough context so that I can get ahead of any issues, uhm, so it&#39;s, it&#39;s a more of an active process rather than
me asking for updates. For Atalem MSPE onboarding, it&#39;s not an onboarding, this is more of a this year&#39;s MSPE cycle.
Last two years, they were really late on our projects, and we, we they were very unhappy with the, with the results because of the delays, and</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3fc6af60ecff430bab1d793643e137ad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum</pre></td><td><pre>Here we&#39;ll take a look at the curriculum module and on the left side we have the different curriculum pages The global objectives page allows us to see all of the PCRS or other national standards that we&#39;re going to be mapping to.
Program objectives plays out the institutional objectives. We can create those and import them. And the curriculum module is also some something that&#39;s linked to an academic period.
So changes can be made from one year to the next and the date is always preserved. We can map program objectives to the national objectives and then we can create all the courses in here and define course faculty and groups.
And add all the course objectives and then those course objectives can be mapped to the program level objectives. And we have our session level information.
These are all the lectures, labs, and other small group sessions. These have schedules that can be linked to it. Keywords, content.
And we can also map session level objectives to the global, I mean the program level objectives. Once the objectives and keywords and other items are built out, we also have the ability to search and see how everything ties together.
We can search for session objectives or course objectives. We can also search for different keywords. And here we can also search.
for Once the curriculum is in here, we can lay out. on the session level schedules, and then also send out course evaluations for the scheduled courses.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9b77406ac1d8484abfff9088f6b9f958</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Student Portal</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a brief look at the student portal in Metrix, in Metrix platform. When a student logs in, right in the middle they have their events for the week.
You can see rotations here, you can see lectures, labs, and other small group sessions. Evaluations they have to do right in the middle.
Announcements that have been sent out by the school. And then on the left menu, we can add, access all of the different modules.
I won&#39;t go through all of them, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll touch on a few of them, a few of the core modules.
My Profile allows the student to go in here and update and download different documents. The Benefits module allows the student to submit time off requests.
And they can request that time off here and submit it to an administrator and the administrators will be able to approve it and that will be shown on all of the schedules.
This also has email notifications associated with it so they will know when they&#39;re they&#39;re approved or declined. The calendar shows the full set of events they&#39;ve been scheduled to for preclinical students.
This shows the lectures, labs, and other small group sessions. For clinical students, it&#39;ll show the rotations or clinics that they&#39;re scheduled to.
You can click on these events and see more details if you need to and if you&#39;re using a personal calendar such as Google, Outlook, or Apple Calendar, there&#39;s a way to sync with that.
Case logging allows the clinical students to log patients&#39; information logs and have that tallied up to see which requirements they have fulfilled.
So I can go to diagnosis scene and if I have a list of diagnosis for pediatrics that I need to fulfill, it&#39;ll show that and also tell me how many I still have to do.
The evaluations module allows us to see all of the evaluations that have been assigned to me to complete. And if they have uhm ad hoc evaluations they can complete, it also shows up here.
For requirements, here I can submit various paperwork that I have to complete. Schedules page shows all of the rotations and other activities that have been scheduled to.
I can also look up more details about the site where that I&#39;m going, where I&#39;m scheduled for. And the clinical students can also use this.
This functionality to request electives in the system and have the administrators approve those requests. Resources allows us to see documents.
that have been shared by the school for, uhm, whether this could be handbooks or rotation resources such as goals and objectives and have that all centralized.
So this has been a brief overview of the student portal and depending on what is getting configured into the, into the admin side, they will see different, uh, uh, different pages getting filled with data.
So if we&#39;re using it for preclinical students, the calendar will get updated, the evaluations will start to show preclinical evaluations they can complete.
If we&#39;re using it for clinical students, you&#39;ll see more case logging, evaluations, schedules, uhm, and then for uhm all students.
You can also use the time off, resources, requirements, and so on. Students also have access to knowledge base where they can get more help if they need to learn how to use the platform.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/165c045af1e047e284c9f62a9fb9ab2f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leadership Mentorship - Google Docs - 4 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Jerry and Chris, wanted to send this document over, this is something that Chris and I went over to recently in our one-on-one and I know you guys have these meetings planned out so I figured I&#39;d share with both of you and Thank you.
Bye-bye. You can use this as some suggestions for your meetings. Feel free to adapt this as needed. This is something that I wanted to plan out so that the discussions between both of you both of you about leaving communication is targeted at some of the bigger projects that we are working on and some
overall communication improvements based on Cris becoming more and more into managing different team members. So the first thing I have here is our biggest onboarding to date is going to be this BSN onboarding.
So our number one goal with this is to go live on time without devices. Which means that we have to start, they&#39;ve already started planning out the functional specs and are about to go kickstart the implementation, which means that we have to be on our we have to be proactively managing them and also
anticipating potential problems and getting ahead of it. So I had a suggestion here for Chris to share some of the recordings of the meetings he had.
With Chris, with Jake and the team at Atalem so that Jerry can review it and then in the meetings that you both of you have, you can discuss feedback on how to run those meetings.
Uhm, and what are any suggestions for improvements? Then after that, it&#39;s essentially Chris will know the scope of the projects and what are the things that need to be done from a onboarding perspective and from a development perspective.
How do we? Delegate that internally and communicate that to the team. So that we get those things done from our end, and then on those recurring meetings that we have with the talent to onboard them, anticipate what problems they may have and try to.
Help them avoid it, and then from a communication standpoint. Strategies to keep me updated on those meetings and what other things are happening so that if there are anything that I need to help with.
I&#39;m aware of it, and in general being able to know what the progress is on our biggest client. So what&#39;s the effective way to communicate updates internally so that there&#39;s context.
That&#39;s one of the methodologies here that I&#39;m trying to incorporate into our handbook. Jerry, I&#39;m sure you have other ones that you may be able to talk with Chris about and then maybe even share with others on the team.
Then there&#39;s the MSPE onboarding that&#39;s, it&#39;s not really onboarding, it&#39;s going to be them running this year&#39;s MSPE. We want to make sure, unlike the last couple of years, we finish on time this year.
This means planning out our projects effectively. And then also managing Atalem effectively, so they get ahead of their problems. Uhm, and one thing that we want to avoid is simply being reactive to their challenges.
When we get on a call with them, we want to go in there with, These are the things that we need you to do, and then send that to them in writing, and hold them accountable to it.
Because if we left, leave it up to the 20 people that are on the call, it&#39;s just going to be multiple meetings without making progress towards the, the the tasks that need to get done.
So those are the big two projects. And then, in terms of Chris is leading a couple of weekly meetings with the team, suggestions for creating an agenda for those meetings.
How do you get the other team members to collaborate? Because often they&#39;re simply listening and not really engaging. It&#39;s one or two people that are talking.
How do we make sure that the agenda is structured so there&#39;s more collaboration? And then, any, any uhm, effective ways to write action items?
Which, for the most part, we&#39;ve been, Chris has been delegating this to others and they&#39;ve been doing it, uhm, but how do we make sure that we have a overall strategy for action items?
If someone else is not writing those. Down in that meeting. So I hope this helps, uhm, I&#39;m actually not going to number them here one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/453923dd379d4fe9b5adda7883fadeac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(3) 2023 | Powered by Box - 20 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Alejandra, so I added you to Box.com so you can help us with this tax paperwork.

Curriculum Map (MSU) – Figma - 2 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, what I wanted to go over really quickly was This ad new session, I&#39;m wondering If we uhm Want to do it this way in or when we click this it opens up this panel and we simply make this editable at the top and the reason I&#39;m thinking is it&#39;s kind of disjointed here you create a session and then
you save it and you have to open it up and when it comes to MSU this is one of the things that she asked in our on our call it&#39;s like why do I have to create it separately and then do show so to avoid that if we if we bring up this panel and write a at the top in session details we just make this re
i know that we were planning on doing reusing all the models but instead of doing that we just put these fields at the top as an editable section and when you save it becomes a table but if you click edit it becomes editable right at the top so that way we&#39;re no longer having a disconnected experience
where you&#39;re creating it and then editing it rest of it can work the same way where we are adding a session and reusing the model models that&#39;s the only thing that I wanted to point well one more thing is like we we had talked about the first version to exclude the schedules to make it easier to build
so we can drop this section and then we&#39;ll do that in a follow-up issue so connecting this to this modal and then removing the schedules and when we write the specs we want to make sure that we we clarify that these keywords instruction methods assessment methods we&#39;re not going to remove any back-end
fields we&#39;re simply going to be giving them a way to select that method type but all of the back-end things will still remain the same.
Because we don&#39;t want to accidentally lose any data for existing clients.

When a student logs in, they have this dashboard where they can see what are their scheduled events or rotations, any evaluations they have to complete, announcements, and then if there are also evaluations or others that need to
be completed, there&#39;s also a quick stat on the right side. On the left menu, we have all of the different modules they have access to.
For example, if I go to my profile, I can see different documents that I have to upload. If there&#39;s something missing, it&#39;ll indicate that.
And I go to my calendar, I can see my full calendar. This includes both the rotations as well as different ah rotation, rotations as well as different classroom based ah lectures, labs, small group sessions.
So for example, here, this is. A. A rotation that this resident is the student is scheduled to go back in time to the previous month.
We can start to also see. Some sick days that has been approved any. Shifts that they&#39;ve been scheduled to if they&#39;re part of a clinic that they&#39;re covering.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8513b50e02254caab4d87e60b783f15d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Institutional Schedules View</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m very excited today to share our new schedules page. You can access it by clicking the schedule link at the top right of your page.
Once you click that, you&#39;ll be taken to a page that has two. Views. There&#39;s the table view or list view, and then there&#39;s the timeline view.
Both will allow you to access all of the schedules from your institution in a very dynamic manner. So first we&#39;ll start on the list view.
This page allows you to select any day and see who&#39;s covering that day. So if I go back to a date here that I know that I have schedules in here, I can see rotation schedules.
So here Bruce Banner and Blake Johnston is in cardiology. I can also see shift schedules, who&#39;s covering the a.m. Clinic.
Then I can also see who&#39;s off. So Tony Sark is taking the day off and that&#39;s something that I can be aware of.
at the top of our page, we also have filters for different programs. Right now, I&#39;m logged in as an internal medicine user, which means my default is internal medicine, but I can toggle into any of the other programs in my system and select another department.
I also have the ability to choose a specific individual within my organization and see their schedule. Finally, if I come down here, it&#39;s all also a way for me to search specific shifts.
So if I type in AM clinic, it will show me just the AM clinic shifts. Let&#39;s say you don&#39;t want to look at one day at a time.
You want to look at a span of several days. Or several weeks. For this we&#39;ll switch over to the timeline view.
So here we have the timeline view. What is powerful about this view is that I can select any date range and at the bottom I can see a timeline with all the shifts, rotations, and time off requests for that range.
Essentially, this is giving me a high level view of what all the schedules are for that date range. I also have the ability to search.
If I want to search for emergency medicine, I can simply start typing it and it will show me who&#39;s scheduled.
To that emergency medicine shift and what days those shifts are. When I choose a different program, the information will be updated to the people in that program.
This page also allows us to export this into Excel. So you can think of different scenarios where if you need to find where someone is working.
You can go pick that date and choose that person&#39;s name and it&#39;ll show you their schedule. If you need to know who&#39;s covering the the general surgery department, you may want to toggle into the general surgery program and see the schedule.
The other thing about this page is you can also bookmark it. So once you apply any sort of filters at the top or even click on one of these rotations, Thank us. If you bookmark it, every time you come back to this page, those filters will also be applied and you can see who&#39;s going to be scheduled there
. This is especially helpful for faculty members to keep track of which residents or fellows will be coming to that. Department in the future.
And if you ever want to go back to the list view, click the list view, if you ever want to go back to metrics, you can hit, click the home button.
We hope that it will help you streamline some of the clinical schedules and the challenges that are associated with coordinating between different departments.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/39bcc857bf3249dd80b5adf9f4b60a18</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kanban Board - Agile board - Jira - 1 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>This is for us to fix some minor issues on the schedules page. Give a damn second. So I go to the schedules page when I surf for something like ICU.
It doesn&#39;t show up. I think we need, we need to cut this down to three characters. Uhm, otherwise it&#39;s gonna miss a lot.
You know, ICU means finding the main one that we&#39;re gonna miss and there&#39;s a lot of shifts and things that may be called ICU.
The other piece of this is if I were to go to a schedule and I have a wide date range here.
And I search for ICU here, the error message that shows up, shows all the way to the right. If we can make that left just a bit more we can make sure that everybody sees it.
Then we have another small issue, where if I choose something like urgent care, and then I click on it, it&#39;ll show this urgent mark care.
Wanna make sure that. Instead of that, it&#39;ll just correctly show the urgent care without this mark. And from a Users that&#39;s in the portal for a resident portal or faculty portal.
It will be convenient if I&#39;m clicking on it, it opens up in a new tab. Because that way they can have it open and if they want to go back to their work.
Whatever they&#39;re doing, it&#39;s still available. Because since this is something that is not part of the system. And you don&#39;t have access to the menu.
Uhm, if we want to have it open on a separate tab. It&#39;s convenient. And some people may not think about opening up a separate tab.
And it&#39;s just something that they&#39;re not used to. So if we force it on a new tab. Then their default interface is still open.
So three things that I mentioned. One is the uhm The ability to search when there&#39;s three characters. The second is on the timeline view.
If I search for a partial name. And then click on the actual The name of that shift or rotation. The the fields.

Right now you&#39;re using the rotation evaluation type which requires the selection of a rotation.
However, if you use program type, a evaluator can simply select the name of an evaluator and complete the form. Since you&#39;re only going to be using this for a post call after weekend, you don&#39;t need them to select the rotation and they can simply submit the form by selecting a resume.
And the date that they submitted the form will allow you to know what shifts it was covering. If you want to give them a field to submit a date, you can add a question on the form.
Let&#39;s say if I go to edit form, this is a this is a demo server and there is a date field.
If you want to add that, that would allow the resident or the attending to select a date that they are that they&#39;re evaluating.
It&#39;s not necessary. The submission date may be sufficient for you. Your current form, since it&#39;s a rotation form type, you can change that by going to the Evaluation Template, Basic Setup, and then using the Change Form Type option.
We already have a bunch of submissions that was collected using this template. We recommend making a copy of it and then changing the form type.

And uhm. And then what we want to do is send them a copied version of this worksheet. I&#39;m going to make a copy of this.
Make a copy and I&#39;m going to put that in the KU SON folder. And we&#39;ll keep Courses and Rotations, we&#39;ll keep Sessions, but we&#39;ll rename this to Modules.
And then, session content, I&#39;m gonna remove. Global objectives, I&#39;m gonna remove. Course objectives, we&#39;ll keep. Module objectives, we&#39;ll keep. And we&#39;ll remove the mapping.

So this proposal outlines all the different services that we offer including our live chat support, knowledge base, the training that&#39;s provided, the continuous updates, and also lists out the different
modules that are included, and this pretty much includes all of the modules that we typically the offer medical schools, and you can look through it and and we can have another follow up discussion if needed to pick and choose what&#39;s applicable to KUMC&#39;s operations.
To review the pricing at the bottom here. Essentially, we have the core module for managing all the user demographics. As a user&#39;s module.
Then we have the calendar, which allows the school to provide a unified calendar for the students, and also provides attendance tracking if needed for non-curricular events.
And eventually, there is a plan to add it for curricular events for schedules across the board for all four years, preclinical and clinical scheduling.
This includes the group&#39;s management, sorry, the group-based classroom events. This includes lectures, labs, and small groups, as well as the block-based scheduling for the clinical students.
The uhm diagnosis and case logging, site management for all of the affiliate hospitals that you&#39;re working with. Onboarding for collecting various paperwork from the students and assigning them tasks to complete as part of the onboarding process.
This can also be used throughout the four years for different types of paperwork that they need to submit and have it reviewed.
By the administration, resources for various documents that are shared with students, such as handbooks and other guides. Then there&#39;s also documents management in the sense that you can manage medical licenses, other compliance documents in the system, and this can be used for the students as well as
for the preceptors. So, to clarify between the onboarding documents versus the documents management, one is the tool for collecting these documents, the other one is for managing them in the system, and you have various permissions and renewal notifications associated with that.
Projects module, this is for providing a collaborative space, whether it&#39;s for students and faculty or for administration to use that for their quality improvement projects or internal committee projects.
Evaluations for all four years of training, this is a 360 degree evaluations. For classroom based training as well as for clinical training.
Time off management if their trainees need to submit a time off and not sure if this is needed. If not, we can remove it.
Great book for storing all of the students grades for a clinical. Clinical and preclinical rotations are put their clinical rotations are preclinical courses.
This includes the ability to capture comments for preceptors that will be used on the MSP letter. Scholarly activities. Is for the collecting different accomplishments in terms of research, publications, lectures that they gave and so on.
Then we also have our outbound module. This is for custom notifications based on various. Business rules. And the curriculum invent management.
This is a for managing all areas of the curriculum for all four years, including all the courses, rotations and objectives, keywords and permissions to allow faculty members to edit the curriculum.
And then these two modules that are at the bottom here is for the MSPE. The MSPE module includes the letter generation.
Which is the text content and then there&#39;s also the graph and the chart content and that generates all the images and attaches it to the letters.
And the data warehousing. And down here. We have the onboarding we put in 75 hours over 9 month period for implementation.
Essentially this is weekly meetings with our team during that 9 months to implement different modules and each of these weekly meetings.
Meetings at 30 minutes long and it covers specific parts of the system and includes the training associated with that modules.
So we can adjust this as needed if we need to extend this or shorten it, we can. Uhm? Work into this.
So I would say if we want to shorten it, we would be doing multiple projects at one time. So for example, curriculum itself is an onboarding project.
Preclinical is one project. And then MSPE is another one. So if we want to have overlapping projects happening at the same time.
This allows us to shorten that. If not, we can do one after another one and get this implemented over the course of about 9 about 9 months.
And this is the total and you can sort of look at this as the upper limit. If there&#39;s some modules that you don&#39;t need, or if we need to scale down on the support out of the implementation support.
We can do that based on your your team&#39;s availability. And at the top we also summarize the support hours are subscription.
Subscription includes everything. We have support hours through live chat. Email as well as schedule calls and phone. Essentially, once you finish onboarding.
Support team takes over and all of that contact that we have with our team members and including additional training as needed is part of our subscription.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4857ed61ef440bb80b80b1f2ac0adcc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 18 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I want to share this brand new page that has been fully optimized for performance. The My Evaluations page was built from the ground up to ensure that it loads faster and also provide you with all the context that you need to manage your evaluations.
So we have four tabs at the top. The Review tab is new and we&#39;ll go into that in a few minutes.
First tab is the For Me tab and what you&#39;ll notice here is the new filters at the top. It allows you to filter by status, whether it&#39;s an ad hoc form or by date.
So let&#39;s say I want to see the evaluations that were assigned to me in the past year. I can select that date range and it&#39;ll only show me submissions evaluations from those dates.
The review tab on the other hand would allow me to see all of the evaluations that require a review or have at least one review submitted by another person.
If it hasn&#39;t, if the last review was by someone else, it&#39;ll show up in this tab so I can review it and add my own comments to it.
So if your institution, if your institution requires you to post reviews on certain portfolio you can use the review tab to see what are the new comments that came in for those portfolio submissions and then add your own, your own uh uh comments to it.
So the my, the for me will show everything that I have to submit. The about me will show me all the forms that were submitted about me and the review tab will show me all the new reviews that came in that I need to review and comment on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8c7d8fab83a1412fbd23e215c9e60d1f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>University of Kansas School of Medicine Full Medtrics Proposal - PandaDoc - 28 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Kayla, here&#39;s a review of the proposal that I&#39;m sending over to you. This is something that includes all of the modules that we discussed, as well as a general overview of the pricing model for the school, with a implementation plan that can span about 9 months.
Well, we&#39;re not sending the plan over, but the the understanding with the proposal is that you will be implementing all modules that are offered and it&#39;ll be done over nine months.
So, in the beginning, we kind of provide a general overview of the things that we provide. One thing that I want to highlight is our subscription includes all the support that&#39;s needed.
Every client receives a live chat support that&#39;s built into the platform for administrators. We also provide training both during the onboarding meeting.
As well as on-demand training afterwards. If for example you hire a new staff member and they need training. We provide one-on-one training as needed without additional cost.
For knowledge bases built into the platform. With articles and videos that&#39;s included and every month we&#39;re also rolling out new feature updates for all the modules that you purchase.
Those updates are included with subscription. Including any AI features that we&#39;re releasing this year. Then as we go down the the proposal, these are the different modules that we offer.
And. When we get down to the. Support these are hours. You can reach us via phone, email, live chat and.
Scheduled zoom calls. That&#39;s part of the subscription also, so it&#39;s not just a software. It&#39;s the it&#39;s the support and there&#39;s also a quarterly check-in that happens with the leadership for customer success management.
Here&#39;s the pricing. For the different modules. And one of the things that I want to highlight here is we&#39;ve included the modules based on our meetings.
So for example, the learner and educator management allows you to manage the profiles of all the different modules. So this is one is the user&#39;s module, something that&#39;s required and also includes management of the groups that are that are used for scheduling calendar and attendance.
This is one gives you a unified calendar for the the organization and overlaid different ah schedules onto it and there&#39;s also a way to do a QR code based attendance using the calendar. Schedules for preclinical and clinical scheduling with ah applica- elective application management, case logging for
your for your for your uhm diagnosis and procedure. procedure logs, site management for affiliated hospitals and different campuses that you have. Requirements module, we didn&#39;t include because this may be something that&#39;s handled somewhere else. I don&#39;t think we discussed. It&#39;s actually collecting various
paperwork such as immunization records and other information in metrics resources. We didn&#39;t include. This is the file sharing that&#39;s built into the platform. If you want to have folders and pretty give permissions to different individuals. Individuals for various files, documents management, compliance
tracking, this goes hand in hand with requirements. One is for collecting those documents, the other one is for managing the exploration and renewals for those ah documents. It also has permissions that you can be given to site administrators to download those documents from metrics. Projects, I know
we are talking about projects for the administrators. Um, we didn&#39;t include this because I want to make sure that it is something that would meet your needs. It wasn&#39;t initially built for committees, but you can check it out and see if it works for you and then if it does work we can add it on later.
Evaluations module. This is for your trainees for all four years. You can do 360 degree evaluations for classroom based training or clinical training. Time off management. We haven&#39;t discussed that so. So. Did it include that? Great book for housing all of your student grades for first and second year
classroom grades. As well as third and fourth year clinical grades with comments from preceptors. And this is something that is necessary for the MSPE module. So you can store the grades and then the MSPE module use that information to generate the letters. For scholarly activity, this is for the portfolio
items that we mentioned. Then for for curriculum management, this is all four years of your curriculum. You can build your courses, your electric rotations, map all the objectives, create tags for keywords, also give permission to faculty members to manage those curricular events. Thanks watching! Then
for MSPE, there&#39;s two components to this. One is our letter generation, essentially this is a standard letter generator that you can use for MSPE, as well as any other document. That you want to create, such as some sort of remediation plan, or any letters that you give to the students, you can automatically
generate using our letter generator. And then there&#39;s a chart generator. This is for all of the charts that go into the MSPE, and this creates separate charts based on the grades in the gradebook. Additional services we discussed was the data warehousing. And then for onboarding, we&#39;re putting a recommended
75 hours of onboarding. Essentially, this would be about nine months of weekly onboarding meetings with us. This allows us to implement each of the different modules. And we typically break this up into projects that have the preclinical as one project that last year. Two to three months, the clinical
as another project, the curriculum as another one, and then the MSPE modules and another module, another onboarding project. So each of them has a series of meetings associated with it where we train. The staff also discuss processes that can be developed internally to make full, take full advantage
of the flat for uh, take full advantage of metrics. And it&#39;s really a hands-on approach that we take during onboarding. And by the end of the nine months, you&#39;re essentially going to be fully utilizing the platform, trained on it, and then also have the content necessary to maintain it going . And forward
with other staff members. We can do this in less than nine months if we do multiple projects at one time. So if you want to know the clerkship and the MSP module at the same time, as long as the staff Thank you As time to work with us, we can shorten this time frame and do multiple project simultaneously.
That may require less hours if we have less meetings. So in terms of the proposal. you The first year fee would be 178 if we go with all of these modules and if we have a 75 hours of onboarding. After the first year. here. It will be 163 per year for those all the modules and umm. If there&#39;s any. Support
that&#39;s needed for integrations. Thank patience. Thank you Thank you Thank you That&#39;s something that we can come up with a separate project as needed. Typically that&#39;s if it&#39;s something that&#39;s part of our onboarding meetings we can cover IT&#39;s needs as part of that . Umm if they need dedicated support
we may need to allocate hours for developers to get support on how to build some of these integrations. That&#39;s the only other thing that we&#39;re not including here because there&#39;s some unknown Don&#39;t. In fact you&#39;re there on how we will support the developers. So please tell me what questions you have more
than happy to hop on a call with you and talk through any details and then and then update this that proposal if needed. .</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/aeb260ec2ba34e33aa39775f9ad64d64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 18 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>The metrics product team is excited to share this new valuations page that has been fully optimized for both faculty, students and residents.
When you arrive on this page you&#39;ll now notice that there an extra tab called a review, and we&#39;ll talk about, on the forme tab I can see all the valuations that are assigned for me to complete.
These are forms that are meant to evaluate somebody else. You&#39;ll see this new filters at the top, and by default you&#39;re seeing all the two items here.
This includes both the two two items that are pending as well as overdue. And you can also come here and search for different assignments.
You can search by the name of the person as opposed to evaluate the rotation name or course name. And so on.
There&#39;s also a filter for filtering out only the ad hoc forms that you started. And then if you want to find evaluations that were assigned on a specific date, you can find that using the filter.
Thank Thank you. The about me tab will show all the submissions that were completed by someone else evaluating me. And we have a similar filters at the top.
Keep in mind that when you come to this page, you want to click on the filters if you want to use it.
It doesn&#39;t open up. Then finally, the new review tab, this is meant for looking at reviews that are submitted on one of the forms that were done on you.
So if you go to this tab and you see. It forms here. It means that somebody has submitted a review and you should read it and either comment on it or acknowledge it.
So if you have an institutional requirement to look at portfolios. If your students are. They are submitting portfolio items and your your preceptor that needs to submit reviews for it.
Once you have a review process started and the student submits something as a as a second submission. So initially they submitted the portfolio item.
And then you&#39;re going in there and providing feedback and they resubmit it. It&#39;ll start showing up in this review tab.
The first time they submit it it may show up in the for me. But once you get the review process started it&#39;ll come into the review tab.
And from here you can open it up and go down to the bottom and submit your review. And this will now go into the students review tab.
We hope that this is going to be helpful in getting your valuations done efficiently. Please let us know if you have any thoughts on any feedback on this new update to the valuations page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/84d6edf5b2c442e4bb283e40b0eba6fb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mark, so for this demo tomorrow, I wanted to show some roster, I mean academic progress data. In order to do that, I need your help setting up some data on the gradebook setup.
I already created a framework here we have first-year courses, second-year courses, cores, and then electives broken down into medicine elective, surgical electives.
And what I would like you to do is use chat GPT and then go here and say create uhm five first year medical school courses with a unique You code name for each so I can add it to a education management software so you can see that created these in here and we can copy the name and the code and you can
also ask it to create a number of credits. So essentially what we want to do is fill this up with data using ChatGPT.
It should have number of weeks. If it&#39;s in a rotation and number of course the number of credits if it&#39;s a course.
Once we have that set up we go into rotations and I think Mike already created a uhm bunch of these rotations already what you can do is take these and map them to the appropriate records in the grade book.
So this is something that once it&#39;s mapped, if we have a schedule like we have here, it&#39;ll show us what roster, what progress they&#39;ve made towards those records.
Requirements. So setting up the gradebook setup, mapping some of those rotations to the to the gradebook rotations and then for one or two of these medical students filling out a schedule uhm you could you could even do this where you can take a cop like a take a screenshot I mean a copy of this and
say here is a list of rotations for medical school create a schedule for a mock student that is four weeks long for each rotation So, essentially, it&#39;ll help you create a mock schedule that you can simply implement.
You may even be, able to do an import here if you want to. So essentially download the import file, give it the rotation like I did for the copy and paste, and say fill out the CSV with the details so that you can import it.
But all it&#39;s not important for us to fill everything out. It&#39;s need one or two students that I can demo.
To summarize setting this up with a bunch of First year, second year courses, core rotations, electives And then going to the rotations And mapping these to the core rotations and electives Based on their names And then creating a schedule for one or two students And then what I&#39;m going to do during
the demo is pull this Dashboard up and then I can show this Dashboard to them and show them how it fills up As the students are getting scheduled to Different rotations</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b6aecb2e50e345d38a5924e0278a4645</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 23 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So the purpose of this import file is for us to load data into Metrix gradebook. So under gradebook grades we can add two types of grades into the system.
There&#39;s course grades and there&#39;s rotation Course grades are meant for the preclinical or classroom based training And this is courses like anatomy and biochemistry While rotations are experiences they complete as part of their third and fourth year where they go to different hospitals and work with
ah mentors The difference ah with where this information is stored uhm when you&#39;re adding a score we also have to tie it to uhm the schedule in the system so if its a rotation grade then under system setup we have block schedules that we create for different rotations and it has a start date and end
date. These rotations themselves are created under system setup under rotations so we create them in the system setup rotations and then tie them to a hospital that it belongs to and then on the schedules page we assign students to those rotations.
The other component of this is the classroom based training. Anatomy, biochemistry, and so on. We schedule them in the course using the curriculum module and you can see here that under curriculum, courses, and rotations we have uhm courses here and each of those courses have a start date and an end
date So the tricky thing about this upload and what we can discuss is whether we should have one gradebook upload that handles both course and rotation courses grades or if it&#39;s easier for us to make this into two import files.
This template that I created is using one import and then essentially the logic in the system will decipher whether it&#39;s a course grade or a rotation grade.
So when they fill this out they&#39;re going to have the academic period which go if I go to add score uhm everything has to be tied to an academic period so right now on this interface were not specifically choosing one but I believe with based on the grade it gets added to an academic period so this column
we may I&#39;ll we&#39;ll have to talk about it whether or not if we want to explicitly say this on here or if it&#39;s something that we want to just use a date and then tie to an academic period which which may be better since it matches what&#39;s in the system.
Next column here is score type. And this is the this field whether it&#39;s a final grade or a uhm uhm basically what&#39;s a final grade, midterm grade and so on and then the next thing here is the status so thats gonna be the primary status here then we have the secondary status here and we&#39;re doing text matching
for those the program is going to be the the program field at the top again I am wondering if there&#39;s a way that we can avoid this based on the and get this information from the other data that&#39;s being uploaded student email or student ID one of those two.
Things to be required score date for that actual grade and this information can give us the academic period if we need to then theres a description field so thats this this field here percentile i dont uhm i dont uhm i dont uhm using this field this is looks like its on the back end but maybe not on
the front end uhm graded coarse rotations so this is this field here and its linking to all the courses and rotations we added to the grade book as the roster for the school curriculum course code this is if its being uploaded as a classroom based course then this is referring to this code for the curriculum
course code and then using that code we can look at the start date and end date and find like this is the start date and end date we can find out which record in the system we can tie this grade to so we would have to query for derm I mean for a code in the curriculum with this start date and end date
and then attach the grade to that if it&#39;s a rotation grade we do something slightly different we look at the rotation code and query the user schedules table and then find the start date and end date for that student that matches that particular rotation that would also allow us to add the grade to that
record in the system so essentially with these three fields whether its the curriculum course start date and end date or the rotation code start date and end date we&#39;re trying to match up an existing schedule in the system if for some reason we don&#39;t find a match what we would need to do to do is give
them a way to manually add that information into the gradebook. So we have the rotation that can be like we can actually select the rotation and to the start date and enter the number of weeks.
Directly in the gradebook record without tying it to an existing schedule so that part of the logic would also be what I&#39;m thinking is when we do the initial upload we can give them an option on the interface that says if umm if a matching core schedule or rotation schedule is not found then create umm
create that schedule information as part of the great record. Umm if they don&#39;t want that to happen then we&#39;re going to essentially umm show it as a failed upload because they dont have a matching rotation or or schedule in the system so then the rest of this thing is just filling out information so
we got primary status I want to delete this here since we already have it on the beginning so there&#39;s primary status, secondary status and other status and then we have evaluate your email, evaluate your comments and revise the comments.
So thats under comments here evaluate your comment then if you revise a comment and do a revised comment it will show a separate record but its going to be the same evaluator for BOLT See next time.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b562c11d126a4b808ef51a1f831752c1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kanban Board - Agile board - Jira - 9 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alejandra, I wanted to get your help on something here.

I wanted to create a short video to show you how to pull in trainees from ERAS and ensure their accounts are created properly and avoid creating duplicates.
So when you have metrics set up for your program, you may have already entered your ACGME ID on the ERAS page.
This can be accessed by going to System Setup, Integrations. And on this page, you&#39;ll have the option to retrieve trainees from ERAS.
Before a trainee can be pulled in, ERAS platform requires their status to be set as Will Start. If you need instructions on how to do that, you can click this button.
It&#39;ll give you a PDF from AAMC with all the steps that you need to take to mark them as Will Start.
After that, click the Retrieve Trainee button and it&#39;ll bring in all the details here. then you can scroll down. If you don&#39;t want to pull something in, you can click this checkbox and unselect it.
Otherwise, once you get to the bottom, you&#39;ll start to see the medical school information, which you have to map to the medical school field in metrics by selecting the appropriate field.
For GME history, you want to, if something is coming from ERAS, it&#39;ll show up here and you can choose the appropriate program in the GME section here on the right side.
If there&#39;s more than one GME history that&#39;s getting imported, each of those will show up in a separate section. Once all that information is configured, you have the create in user metrics option at the bottom.
This would allow you to select a class of year. This is going to be their expected graduation year, their home institution where they&#39;ll be working and employed, their role, and for all of the trainees that are coming to your institution from.
external organizations, you want to set this as incoming resident or incoming fellow depending on your your institution. This way you&#39;re not choosing a PTY role until until July.
If you use a PTY role, then they may receive email notifications and uh evaluations that are targeted towards your current PTY uh PTY1 trainees.
The activation date here is going to be the date that they are allowed to log into Metrix for the first time.
So you can set that to the date where you want them to start their onboarding process. Then when you click the train create trainee account, Metrix will go ahead and set up that Bye bye.
Account and give you a confirmation at the bottom. So that&#39;s the steps you have to take to create all these trainees in Metrix.
One caveat here is if your trainees are already in Metrix and there are two scenarios that- that uh in which this would happen.
One they were there as a medical student and now they&#39;re coming in as a resident. You don&#39;t have to pull them in for- you&#39;re asked.
Instead you can go into the users page, search affiliate people with this program and search for that trainee and then affiliate them with the program and update their details in their account.
So for example if you&#39;re a medical student you could change their role from a resident. To uh from a student to a resident.
And choose the incoming resident role. You can also update their home institution to be your institution. So that&#39;s the first scenario if they are coming in as a resident.
And they were at your institution as a student doing rotations. The second scenario is if you are a fellowship program and one of these trainees were on site for residency.
And they&#39;re finishing up that residency and they&#39;ll be starting at your instance. In that scenario, you would still want to go into the program and search for that trainee and affiliate them with your program.
But since that trainee is gonna finish that residency program until the end of June, you don&#39;t want to change their role because that will change the role in their home program, right?
Uh, and the home specialty. So you would pull them in. Start setting up anything you need to set up and then advance that role at the end of the academic year so that they become a fellow at when they have finished their residency program.
It&#39;s always best to search the affiliation. to create people to program section before you import from U.S. to make sure those trainees do not exist.
If they if they already have an account, it&#39;s always best to work with that existing account to prevent duplicates from being created.
I hope this video helps you with this process and I wish you all the best in onboarding these new trainees and get them up and running as physicians at your institution.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6ad868e4274d414c86b1ec53af060e3e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Guaranteed Payments for Chris, Rio &amp; Santhosh_Medtrics Labs - Google Sheets - 28 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Morning Harpy, thank you for putting together this document. I went through it, and I wanted to review the comments that I added.
So for Chris, we can see that we have some extra, for the first half of last year, it is payments were $6,500 and $1,000 was getting added to the loan account.
And then starting June, he started taking the full $7,500 out. These extra payments, like $25, $120, those are meant, those are reimbursements for expenses that he had.
It should not be considered as a uhm uhm guaranteed payments. So they should have been a reimbursements. So, We could see here that it should be $7,500 and then I put in here that for each of those months that he did not take out the full $7,500, we can add $1,000 to his account.
For Chris, I mean for Rio, same thing. For any month that he did not get the $1,000, I mean the $7,500, we&#39;re adding $1,000 to his account.
Any of these extra payments, We can treat them as payments that he made. For Chris and Rio, we can treat them as extra payments, that is on the guaranteed payments.
But they should, He should be getting $1,000 added to the account for these months. Because one of the things that Rio is getting in addition to the reimbursement is every time he&#39;s coming out of the, working out of the office, he gets $25 per day.
Uhm, but for the sake of simplicity, we can keep the $1,000 for each of these months and the rest of it we can keep it as is with the vendor payment.
For mine, it&#39;s a little bit more complicated, I added more notes here. For this payment, this is not my payment.
This is a loan repayment for the Marybeth loan and it&#39;s getting mixed up. Because Marybeth is my wife and payment comes to my same bank account.
But this is supposed to be classified as Marybeth loan. These are correct. This one here, this is a reimbursement. And it should be a reimbursement for Maria&#39;s payment for that month.
So if you look at Maria&#39;s 1099, she&#39;s a contractor. She would have only been paid 2,000, half of this from Metra.
The rest, I paid for it from my bank account because we didn&#39;t have enough cash, then I reimbursed myself. So this should be a reimbursement that goes into Maria&#39;s account.
This here is a loan payment for a, Marybeth loan. We had missed nine months of payments and then we had a lump sum payment.
This here is a reimbursement which was processed through Zenni. So I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s getting added to my loan.
Uhm, so they, I had submitted receipts through Zenni and they were separate transactions that it reimbursed me for. So it should be broken up into the account, like appropriate accounts.
For my payments, it should be $7,500. I paid per month for the past 12 months and that was unpaid. The reason that I was getting the $4,400 was supposed to be a partial payment and then the rest was supposed to get into the loan account.
But I liked. To have all this apply to the loan and then my unpaid total will be $7,500 per month for the whole year.
So all of these need to be added to my loan account and then these need to be corrected.

With Gundersen, we see a potential opportunity for us to develop a partnership in, with a shared vision where we can, in the short term, address some of the challenges that the, that is happening on the operational level and set up tools that centralizes the learning experience.
With time, we see an opportunity to close the bridge, close the gap between the learner and the workspace by having a way for the organization to provide career opportunities directly to the trainer using the same platform.
At Metrix, we&#39;re also very focused on on ah customer experience and ensuring that both the learners and employees and educators are not only learning but also are fully engaged in the platform and connecting with others through the system.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6d8bb33638a74d19a6aa2694a08c751d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Maria, so this is a report for the billable students on CU&#39;s Chamberlain server and I believe you had done this in the past and what I need help with is calculating the total number of students they had active for the FNP and DNP for the last year.
So this I calculated this from 27th of February till today and each of these columns has a 0 or a 1 based or based on whether they use that module So what we want to do is add a column to the right side that shows a value of uhm value if they have a 1 or anything other than a 0 in one of these columns
or if it&#39;s true actually no I think the active and inactive is not really used right now so essentially if any of these columns have a value other than 0 we want to be able to see that on the right side so that we can filter for total number of students that are in FNP or DNP that used one of our modules
then we can build based on that so if you can help put that together then I can share that with them and we can start that renewal process thank you</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e74e8cfaabe34dfc9ed61a1d3f9311e6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Learner Management System - FINAL.docx - Google Docs - 7 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Here are three ideas on how to unfold an innovative ways to manage learners. One, connecting Using a learner and engagement management system to connect learners and educators.
We have clients, one of our clients, Marshfield Clinic, allows when a student arrives on campus at one of the hospitals, a coordinator pairs up the student with a preceptor during their time there.
And they&#39;re scheduled on the calendar together, both individuals can see who they&#39;re working together. And it allows. A student who&#39;s coming to a hospital for the first time and do not know anything about that organization to be confident that there&#39;s a mentor waiting for them and for that mentor to
know that it&#39;s going to be a student that works with them. This allows the student to be easily integrated into the organization and the clinical environment and makes the student feel more confident and supported as they navigate their rotations.
The second idea is using the data. Using the in a learner management system to recognize the educators on their contributions.
Essentially, educators are often teaching as part of their job without additional compensation. Some educators are contributing more than others and it&#39;s helpful to use data in a learner management systems such as evaluation, compliance, the schedules, and the feedback they&#39;re getting from.
Their students to recognize which student, which educators are contributing more and support them so that there is a positive reinforcement on their work.
The third uhm ways that a learner management system can be used to promote a cultural for watching. improvement is to use it for managing and creating visibility of quality improvement and research projects.
With Metrix Projects module, organizations can provide their employees and students. With a tool that allows them to create a project with a team and work on it with tasks and comments and share that project with others.
So across the organization there&#39;s visibility. On what projects are being worked on, and as an enterprise, the organization can promote the work that&#39;s being done internally using a special day for recognizing research and quality improvement projects, or even support those learners in promoting those
projects externally.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ac7a6bda304c4d4c82c34ef77dfa67d5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 21 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So this feature is going to be allowing us to import different evaluation assignments that were collected in another software system.
So let&#39;s say we signed a new contract with a hospital. And they have been using another system for several years and we need to move all that historical data into Metrix Currently we don&#39;t have a way to do that So in order for us to do that we have to keep in mind that the forums, the surveys, and other
systems may have questions and answer choices that that are unique and that we dont have those forums in the system So the first thing that we would do is come in here and create templates with all the questions that match the forum in another system So we would create all the Likert questions, multiple
choice questions, text questions and then we have a template that matches the template in the other system Once we have that what we want to do is give the user or the administrator the ability to import data that matches the specific templates.
Let&#39;s say one of the surveys had five questions and each of those are multiple choice questions with two options each.
When we import the data we have to make sure that the import file uhm has data that can be matched up with that template So the first thing that we would do is on the evaluation templates page we would add a button that says import historical evaluations Then we take we&#39;re taken to this page where we
can download and import template This, I would select a form that I created and then I click download. This will give me a CSV file with a list of all the columns with columns that list out the different questions and fields that I need to fill out Then I also show one row of sample data for that template
And then I would fill it out for all the students that I need to import And then I would come down here and attach that CSV file and submit it Metrix would match it up with the evaluator name, role all that and all the questions and answers and then create evaluation assignments in the system.
One thing to keep in mind is that we have different types of forms that we can create course forms, event forms, general.
And each of these are tied to different records in the system so rotation forms maybe tied to rotations in the system so it&#39;s a little tricky to create these import files on the reports page we have a feature called export data this allows us to export data for a specific template similar to what we
are describing here but in the opposite direction this is allowing us to export export data here with this new feature we are importing it but we may be able to look through the code for this feature and create and use it to create those import templates so let&#39;s say I export one of this one of this
rec ah reports I may get something like this where I have all the columns here and then one one then data that was exported from the system here I only have one row of data the idea here is I exported it now I&#39;m going to be able to fill this out and then submit it back into the system to load data into
into Metrix so using the export hopefully we can make this task a little bit easier since we already have that way to get data out of the system now it&#39;s kind of going in the reverse where we&#39;re getting a blank template with one with the list of all the columns and one row of dummy data as an example
and then were coming down here and then submitting it and loading into the system one more thing I want to add here is so we really will have uhm 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 type of import files one for each of the form types because they need to be matched up with the different type of events.
Will have questions on it that will function similar because they can all support or have multiple choice like very multiple text questions so the idea is if i&#39;m selecting a rotation form and when i download the template i will get a few fields that are related to matching it up to rotations and then
the questions and the people data that&#39;s gonna be same as all the other forms</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e7cb0df4e0b5444fa8e92537a81f692d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 7 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics can be used for reporting, for generating data that can be used for various accreditation and regulatory requirements. For example, for residency programs, metrics helps manage all of the work hours that happen at resident work hours and automatically generates any sort of violations of ACGME
rules. So when there is any reporting that needs to be done for compliance of work hours, that can be pulled from metrics.
We also track various attendance records for trainees, if that needs to be submitted and tracked. Metrics includes a full set of tools for logging and tracking demographic information for each of the learners.
And educators. This can be used to document any critical information such as their name, address, as well as emergency contacts.
Their licensing info, credentialing, and certifications, immunization records. All of these items can be tracked in metrics and reported on when it&#39;s required for accreditation or approval.
Regulatory review. There are approximately 50 pre-built reports in metrics. Each of these reports allow the administrators to select data and export it into Excel and or PDF.
We also provide capabilities to connect to business intelligence software like Tableau or Power BI to do more. Customize reporting and dashboards if that&#39;s needed.
And from a finance standpoint, Metrix includes a CMS reimbursement module that allows organizations to generate reports. That can be submitted for collecting financial reimbursement from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f238991f2d904dd79dcf1f986eefe810</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 7 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Let&#39;s update we want to fix a problem with our review status we have two options here they are review completed by administrator review completed by review, pending review by administrator.
We set up metrics for some of our schools they have program administrators that can do these reviews but we also have a way to give access to the admini non-administrators so that they can Good.
Submit reviews from their personal portal or these may be administrators that should not have full program admin access. Those reviews also need to be factored in when we filter by this.
So essentially what we&#39;re going to do is modify it so that the review completed by administrator will include all submitted evaluations that have at least one review by anyone other than the evaluator or evaluatee.
So if there&#39;s a review that was submitted by anyone other than the evaluator, evaluator or evaluatee, we&#39;re assuming that it is someone who has been given administrative access to that review, to that evaluation.
Second is the pending review by administrator we want to include all submitted evaluations that have no reviews and all submitted evaluations that have only been reviewed by evaluator or evaluatee.
There may be a better way to write these queries. I wanted to simply describe it here, uhm, but on what to be included.
And the logic can probably be handled differently. Uhm, essentially when they&#39;re looking at the pending review, uhm. Whether from the personal portal or the program admin portal, they want to simply make sure it&#39;s including anything that needs to be looked at by someone other than the evaluator or evaluatee
and for the first one We want to include anything that has a review by someone who&#39;s not, who&#39;s an evaluee It&#39;s a little Confusing when I say this include all submitted evaluations that has at least one review by any one other than the evaluator or evaluatee Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7575a3c4cbd745fca130fcabf5b408bf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Import – Figma - 21 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Sam, so for this first upload functionality, what we want to do is build a new import for loading historical evaluation assignments.
So when we have clients switching over to us from another platform they may have evaluations that were collected on our different software and we want to take those data points and import it as assignments in the system.
This has been a very painful process in the past so we want to kind of streamline this. So what I&#39;m thinking is on the evaluation templates page is here&#39;s where we create different forms and you can create a new form by clicking create new template and different there are several types of forms that
we can create each of those are different surveys with different ah use for courses or events or or ah rotations and a hospital may use one or more of these evaluation template types medical school may use one or more of these types so it&#39;s it is somewhat complex on how we do this import file what I&#39;m
thinking is we add a button here on the assignment on the templates page that takes them to a second page so we come here add this button when you click on it it&#39;ll come to this page and here they will be able to select a template so on this page they would first come here and create an evaluation template
one or more templates and then here they will select one of those templates because to import the data we have to create a custom CSV file that has the appropriate columns that they can fill out So for example, if we look at this uhm spreadsheet, you can see that it has the course, the form name, which
is the evaluation template name, the course start date and end date, Thank you. If it if it was a session it&#39;ll have information here when it was assigned uhm and then every question and every uhm answer answer choice.
So essentially we&#39;re trying to create a CSV that they can download with all of the columns and with columns for for each of the questions and potential answer choices.
So they can simply create this import file by filling out data onto that template. So I have 500 students that submitted evaluations I&#39;m on one form in a different software When I want to import that into Metrix Metrix is going to give me a template as a spreadsheet with all the column names using one
of the templates in the system Then I would fill that out for those 500 students, come down here, import that CSV file, and Metrix will match up that data fields and uhm load that data into the system So that sounds it is a little complicated and something that may help you with this uhm I have not created
separate import files for this uhm I&#39;m gonna this is something that Chris is working on but you may be able to do this using our export capabilities so if I go to reports export data we have a something like something similar here where I can go here and select a template and click generate report and
then it gives me a template essentially if what I&#39;m doing is exporting raw data and its giving me this only has one submission so its giving me one one row of data but you can see how using this export I can sort of create an import template because if I come in here and fill this out with more data
and send it back into the system then its able to digest that into the database and create assignments. It ah has a student ID, student name, I mean student names all that information on here we can we will probably need to add the student ID number actually we do have that here too.
Evaluator name L-A-T yeah we do have that so evaluator employee code is the student ID so similar to this what would happen is we come to come to this page, select a template, download the template, fill it out, come down here, submit that template back into the system and it would populate the database
with the assignments. So i wanted to send this over to you for now and then once if you&#39;re able to create these templates yourselves using some sample that was exported from the system great if not chris will be following up with the the csvs that match each of the different form types</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4a84a188fb9144fa9b50ea3dea8a825b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Questions - Google Docs - 22 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon. I want to thank you for your patience with, with this email. It took me a little longer than expected to respond.
My end of year ended up being a little more packed and filled with meetings. I want to, review these questions with you and, uhm answer them.
So, first question here, who&#39;s building the clinical rotation form? For all of the forms that you have to create in the system as a template, we can do that for you.
Typically, it&#39;s done by the institution, but in this instance, it&#39;s a one-time setup, and I believe you&#39;re doing this on your own, so we can help create those forms and set up the automation rules, so that&#39;ll save you some time.
Uhm, we will need you to set up the schedule, though. Once the schedule is in there, that&#39;s what the system uses to automatically assign these evaluations.
Uhm, I also want to confirm that we can handle all of these form assignments. Metric supports full 360 degree evaluation.
You can have peer-evaluating peer, whether it&#39;s faculty or trainee, students evaluated in the faculty, faculty evaluated in the students, and site director evaluating evaluations.
The key thing is, we create raw data. We use for different types of users and then use the automation to assign evaluations based on those roles.
That&#39;s why it is possible to assign forms to different types of users, evaluating each other. Every user in the system, whether it&#39;s peer, whether it&#39;s faculty members, trainees, site directors, each of them has a profile, you can go back and review what evaluations they received and even aggregate reports
based on those profiles. So you can easily look up information for their annual review. There&#39;s also a report that allows you to aggregate scheduling data.
So if you need to review their schedules to see how many hours of teaching they did, there&#39;s a teaching credit report.
And lastly, yes, we&#39;re more than happy to share some references, but I do want to wait until there&#39;s confirmation from you that you have, we have met all of the requirements and the budget.
It is okay to based on our proposal. And the reason I&#39;d like to wait until that&#39;s all confirmed is we ask our, our clients to talk to other institutions and spend time explaining their experience.
We only want to do that if that&#39;s the final step of the process. If there&#39;s something else that is, that needs to be determined, for example, if the budget&#39;s not there or the requirements are not met, it&#39;s better for us to sort that out before we ask the, our clients to spend the time sharing their experience
. But if there is confirmation that both of those things are met, requirements and budget, then in the new year, what I can do is reach out to a couple of places, probably Yale School of Medicine and, uhm, KICOM, one of our medical schools, to, uhm, get their permission to share their contact information
, and then you can talk to them about their experience. You know, you can ask them for their feedback on transitioning to a platform- platform like Metrix, and any, any benefits they received, and even any challenges they face.
And they&#39;ll be more than happy to offer that feedback. So, thank you for sending these questions, and I wish you a happy holiday.
Hope you have a great Christmas with your family, and I look forward to continuing our discussion in the new year.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fc8eee02b4554ad4b9abf308ee931a94</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Partnering with MT Plus for our Podcast 🎙️</pre></td><td><pre>So we&#39;re part, we&#39;re partnering with this organization called MT Plus, their organization that for medical students and they&#39;re going to be inviting their students to be guests on our podcast.

I wanted to create this video going over these questions. Thank you for your patience it took a little bit longer than I expected to respond.
Because this end of year turned out to be a little more packed than I expected. So, for this first question, who is building the clinical evaluation, uhm, who will beware and with whom and the value questionnaire, what we can do is if you simply need help building the form and creating it in the system
, we can help you do that. And this is a one time setup that we can do and train you on how to maintain it.
And it&#39;s once it&#39;s uploaded into the platform, the automation rules can be set up which we can help you with as part of our onboarding process.
And then it&#39;ll keep assigning it to people that needs to get assigned, as long as you&#39;re maintaining the schedule. And I can confirm that we can do peer evaluation, faculty to faculty, student evaluation.
And then site director evaluation of attendings. So all of that can be done. The way that our automation works is, we define roles for each of these types of users.
And then you can define who&#39;s completing the form and who&#39;s getting the getting evaluated. And then the automation roles would match it up based on those roles.
Would metrics keep profile record for every faculty? If they have a peer eval, student eval, yes, every person that is getting evaluated has a profile.
You can to them in the reports, or you can look up their profile and see all evaluations that were submitted.
And then, yeah, this is exactly what a lot of our clients do. They look at it for merit, umm, review, and you can see.
See how the faculty are performing. If you also need to do any sort of reporting on schedules, see who worked with which, like which faculty members worked with different students, there&#39;s also a way to report that allows you to see teaching credit.
And it allows schools to see how many hours of teaching did each faculty member do. And yes, we can provide references to a couple of schools in the new year.
I usually like to check with them to make sure it&#39;s okay for us to share that information before we share it.
One thing that I do want to ask is, is, is everything ready to proceed in terms of all the requirements have you met and you&#39;re okay with the budget?
Because we like to share the references and make connection with the deans or administrators. As a last step of the purchasing process.
Uhm, this way our current clients are only speaking to sales leads or opportunities that have gone through the full review and that&#39;s the last step.
So if there&#39;s any issues with the requirements or if there&#39;s any budget issues it would be helpful if us to talk through that first before speaking to the clients.
Uhm, but a couple of schools that I can introduce you to is Yale School of Medicine. He&#39;s using metrics. Uhm, KICOM, one of the medical schools in Kentucky, I can introduce you to them and, uhm, maybe also Michigan State, so I&#39;ll, uhm, I can reach out to them in the new year and once you&#39;re ready with
the final steps in terms of requirements and budget, uhm, you can talk to them and get their feedback. Please let me know if any other questions come up, uhm, our team is off next week, uhm, but we&#39;ll be back the first week of January.
I&#39;m always checking my emails, so if you have anything that comes up and if you&#39;re working next week, uhm, happy to respond.

It took me a few days to kind of get to it because end of year ended up being a little packed and, and a lot more meetings than I expected.
Let me quickly run through these questions that you had. First, who is building the clinical rotation and the evaluation questionnaire?
So, when it comes to the questionnaires, we can help set that up for you. We typically like to train the team and have the team at the university enter those.
But in this instance, I believe you&#39;re doing this on your own. We can put that as part of our implementation plan where our team will create those forms for you so that it&#39;s not something you have to worry about.
The schedules for the students and, and that&#39;s something that we would need you to input. We can train you on how to set that up.
And even show you how to do a spreadsheet import. Umm, but it is something that is best that you enter it and then you can maintain it as needed.
And this can be addressed, this can be done for all of your forms. We&#39;ll take care of all of the creating the forms.
The forms in the system and helping you set up the automation rules. As for the type of forms, Metrix does allow all of these, peer evaluations, student evaluation rotations, faculty evaluation student, service director evaluation with 10 days.
All of these are possible because our system is structured in a way that we define roles for different types of users and then automation is based on those roles.
You can say, this individual is in faculty and then we can have a trigger and evaluation. To go out to the faculty to evaluate other faculty members.
So full 360 degree evaluations are possible from metrics. For every person in the system, whether it&#39;s a faculty, trainee, or some site director, you can have a profile.
And all evaluations, you need to have a profile. And then all submissions are aggregated under that profile. This allows you to pull that up and reference the evaluations at the end of the year review.
Also run reports when needed. Lastly, yes, I&#39;m happy to give you references to a few institutions. One of the things like Yale School of Medicine KICOM, another medical school that is using metrics.
But I, I, I do want to wait until this is the final step of the purchasing process. You know, make sure that all of the requirements have been met, the budget is good to go, and then I can share these references after getting a confirmation from them that it&#39;s okay to share.
Uhm, the reason why I like to wait until the last step is so that we&#39;re not asking our clients to speak to too many institutions that are looking at metrics.
Uhm, but if everything is good to go in terms of budget, the requirements, then I can make that introduction. We can get the feedback on metrics and the experience of working with us.
Uhm, for example, like, Yale School of Medicine is one I can introduce you in CHI-COM, and maybe also Michigan State.
CHI-COM Osteopathic Medicine. And you can see both of these schools are using a single sign-on, so when I, and I&#39;m logging in here, I can log in using the air.
Uhh, University credentials. So, I will send this over to you, and I am gonna be around next week. Our team is off, but if you have any questions that come up, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
And then in the first week of January, once you confirm that the budget and the requirements are met, I can reach out to a couple of our institutions and get permission to share the contact, and then put you in contact with the leads there, the primary contacts there.
Uhm, again, wishing you a happy and healthy holiday season. Hope you have a great Christmas with your kids and family, and speak to you in the new year.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a6deb33f727c42fa8da8b1b41fccb349</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 19 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this task is for us to update the EvaluateTour and EvaluateT drop downs and what we want to do is add a little, umm, checkbox above it that says, or, let&#39;s, umm.
Actually, we can do a product below it. Add a little checkbox below it that says, include inactive users. And same thing here, include inactive users.
By default, it&#39;ll be unchecked, but if you enable it, it&#39;ll include inactive users, and then an italics next to their name, but not in bold.
The names will be bold, but next to it is in italics. In a normal case, it&#39;ll say inactive. So by default, we won&#39;t show it, but if the checkbox is enabled, it&#39;ll show it, and then it&#39;ll say inactive user.
Actually, one correction there. The checkbox should say, inactive, uhm, inactive affiliation to program. That&#39;s the better way to word it.
Include users with inactive or fleet she has too long. Uhm, yeah, we&#39;ll keep it simple and say include inactive users.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/840f8c4af29e490eba0ebf7d7c913843</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Back from everyone, yesterday when I gave you the demo, I couldn&#39;t show you this report, so I wanted to pull this up here and pull up, this is our competency-based reporting and There is a separate part of the system where we assign questions to different competencies and, and then create evaluations
for, forms from it. What I&#39;m showing you here is our competency-based reports here, so if I choose one of our trainees and choose the date range of 4 years and click generate a report, what it does is it generates a dashboard that gives us all the data that was collected in the past 4 years and summarizes
it into competencies. We have patient care, if I click expand it&#39;ll give me all the data points from the past 4 years on patient care subcompetence, core competency.
Expand that and I have subcompetencies in here and it&#39;s data points and then if you expand that further. It&#39;ll give you every question that was mapped to the subcompetency, the trainees average, the peer average and then you can see that throughout the, all of the core competencies.
This allows you to pin down. Exactly where the trainee is in their growth and also compare them to their peers.
And this information is also visible to the trainees so they can see that progression over time. And one of the things that I see medical schools doing is creating committees and giving us access to certain student data to those committee members and those individuals are reviewing the competencies and
meeting with the students and giving them feedback. So that&#39;s a very good use case for this report. And then from the leadership standpoint, if you ever want to also see a snapshot of a student and where they are, you can pick any student.
And there&#39;s also another report that shows you the snapshot for the entire cohort. Uhm, that&#39;s actually an Excel report that allows you to export all.
The data, but if I choose a specific student and I want to see where they are on their competencies, it&#39;ll give me a snapshot in one page.
It gives you their core competencies and each of the sub-competencies and where they are. There&#39;s a couple other views also, but this is what I wanted to highlight in this video.
And in the next call, we can certainly go in. I to go into more details on how we work with institutions to create a competency-based evaluation system and how to track that information over four years.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1526a87274dd48dd9918fb3b805d29ba</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Eval Summary Report.xlsx - Google Sheets - 18 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>The purpose of this task is for us to add a Excel export for the Evaluation Summary Report.

Umm, review this to see if anything else needs to be updated and then write this up as a task. So you can see here, Group X, Group X, it&#39;s grouping by whatever.
Group we&#39;ve selected here and then spitting it in out into a Excel format. The questions are this way along the sorry, it&#39;s kind of late.
The questions are each rows and then each of the columns are shown as average and then the actual choice itself will show up in the next column.
So average, number of responses, actually in this we want to fix this here as well as confused. It&#39;s supposed to be three columns, number of responses, the average number of responses and the percentage responses.
We can put that aside for columns so that they can sort by that if they need to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4e7dbe6f9964391b9b2814823e8db14</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 18 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>On the Assignments page, we have the ability to select a status of pending review by administrator or review completed by administrator.
The problem with the logic on this drop down is that it does not include users. With permissions to view evaluations.
So if I go in here and I edit this section here to manage evaluations or you can also give someone the ability to manage evaluations as a mentor, they can submit reviews as a mentor.
So it&#39;s not only program administrators that are submitting reviews on an evaluation. So to address these multiple scenarios, what we can do is update the logic of the drop-down so that it will filter, if I choose pending review.
It will show all assignments that do not have a review by someone that is an evaluator or a person that is not the evaluator or evaluator has not submitted a review.
So, or the other way to look at it is, it would exclude any evaluation assignments where you have someone who is not a evaluator or evaluator has submitted a review.
That&#39;s a little confusing. Umm, so let&#39;s, we can look at it as an example. Let&#39;s say we have assignment X and it has been reviewed by the evaluator and that&#39;s the only review that&#39;s on it.
Then when I go in here and I filter for pending review by administrator, it&#39;ll show up on that result. Let&#39;s say one of the mentors goes into the system and submits a review for that same form.
That mentor is not an evaluator and is not an evaluator. When that review gets submitted and I come in here and I filter for pending.
Review by administrator, it would not show up in the results because that submission has a review by an individual who&#39;s not an evaluator or evaluator because we&#39;re assuming that all individuals that are able to submit an evaluation review that&#39;s not an evaluator or evaluator is an administrator.
So hopefully that&#39;s clear. And then once we fix that, then it&#39;ll make it easier for them to track this. Because the only way that someone can have access to an evaluation and submit a review is if they&#39;re giving, given permission as an administrator, either as a program administrator or evaluation module
specific administrator privileges so they can see that form.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/93153d1380284407b94f6e88204ed3b4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 18 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at how to set up Intercom to email all of our clients.

So, I wanted to send you this video to show you a couple of tweaks that I wanted done on the website and we have other improvements that we want to make to the website.
These, we can break this up into smaller projects. That you are quoting as a fixed cost and then as we complete that project, we can work on the specs for the next one and it is important for us to have this fixed cost because this was not something that we initially budgeted and it&#39;s been kind of been
on the back burner as we See you next time. We&#39;ve done other projects, but I think if we can do it as a fixed cost then I can keep adding more and more projects to improve the quality of our website.
So something small that I wanted to have tweaked on the about us page. Was this value section. I wanted to change this instead of having all these nine values that we wrote years ago without much thought.
We gave it much, a lot of thought at the time, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just something that I want to keep nine of them.
I&#39;d rather, I&#39;d rather focus our, the team on three core values and removing this section and then have three values each with one word and a sentence in the box.
Maybe having an icon so that it shows up in the middle. And the second thing is this timeline we have here making a little bit more visually engaging, regular line in the middle and then the dates with the story appearing.
On either side, one after another. So maybe the 2013 will show up on the right side. The 2014 will show up on the left side.
So it&#39;s sort of like a timeline that spreads to both sides. Umm, we can, if you want to mock something up in Figma and we can talk about it, that would also work.
So then the third item is this section at the bottom here that somebody tried to mess with and screwed up.
We can get rid of this. That will be the third item. And you can see in Webflow there&#39;s a lot of things that you can mess with to change the elements.
And I think let&#39;s see. So, actually I could probably get rid of that. That embedded thing right there and at the top there&#39;s also a option to publish to staging first.
So, I&#39;m gonna publish it there. And, let&#39;s see how that looks. So I got rid of that, and then I was just published a production.
And you can see that the bottom section is actually gone. So, we can focus, so, that just happened, that happened to me pretty easy, umm, but these other items I&#39;m not gonna mess with, I&#39;d rather have someone like you with CSS and HTML and JavaScript skills to go in here and figure that out, umm, and
once you figure it out, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s gonna be very easy for you to make other changes. Uhm, I&#39;m optimistic that once we get going, we&#39;ll slowly figure out new things to do on the website and it&#39;d be nice to have someone that is fumu- is capable of making continuous updates as we need because right now
, we don&#39;t have anyone that&#39;s doing it. Awesome. Uhm, so. I want to send this video over and then we can hop on a call and talk about this in more detail and then put together a contract and get going.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1e174b88f6244af4bcf3e334dbb2a76b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>About - Medtrics - 17 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>It can, I hope you&#39;re doing well, I&#39;m excited to get some help with this website and I feel like this is something that you&#39;ll be great at and it&#39;s going to take a little bit of time to get used to the web flow.
From what I saw on your website, it sounds like, you&#39;re great with CSS and HTML and all that stuff. So, if I, once I give you access to this, umm, if you open up, Don&#39;t comment, designer, you&#39;ll have the ability to do a lot of customization here and, There&#39;s an interface that you can use to make changes
, but it&#39;s probably easier to, uhm, write the code. I&#39;m not good with this at all. I mean, I was able to figure out some tweaks that I want to make, to make some significant changes to the page, uhm, nowhere near where I need to be, this kind of stuff.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m hoping that you can pick up on this and then we can slow totally work on multiple changes.
And I&#39;d like us to start with a fixed cost, simply because this is something that was not part of the budget, we were not planning on doing this work and, and it is something that if I, I need to have some predictability on how much it&#39;ll cost.
So I&#39;m thinking we can break this up into projects that update specific parts of the system and then come up with the cost.
And then when you&#39;re done with that. We can do another project for other parts. So to start with, one of the things that I like us to work on is updating the about us page.
Umm, Thank you. Well, there&#39;s a few things that I may want to update here, but as a first project, umm, our core values section here, we have these 9 items here and we wrote these years ago and what I want to do is simplify this to 3 core values and umm, just have those as essentially 3 elements here
, nothing that&#39;s not, it doesn&#39;t need to be expanded and it&#39;s gonna be, umm, they&#39;re all gonna be essentially 1 words, 1 word and then a sentence underneath that.
Umm, so making the app look good, maybe even with an, with an icon. So that&#39;s one of the first things that I want to do and then for this here, how we got here and this.
Section here, it will be nice if they had a nice little timeline here that shows up in the middle with a line in the middle on the left and right.
We have these little Thanks watching! Elements popping up so that as you scroll down, you&#39;re seeing different items appear or you see different elements on the page as you scroll down instead of just listing it out.
And I think what we can do is, uhm, mock this up in Figmo or something and talk about it before you start making changes, but I want to kind of give you, you know, this video and mainly to give you an overview of some of the changes that I&#39;m thinking.
And then once we get into the other pages later on, we may want to restructure a few of the elements.
Well, nothing major. Uhm, I still have to think about it, but about us is definitely something we have to improve.
And then, Uhm, we want to get rid of this thing at the bottom that we have here, which is some sort of mistake, and it looks like there&#39;s some lorem, some code showing up here.
So, let&#39;s, let&#39;s start with that, essentially updating the, uhm, core values. The section here, the timeline, getting rid of that thing at the bottom on the homepage, can be one project, uhm, and then we can.
Go from there.

Work hours module is a way for trainees to log hours when they work on a shift.
And if you come in here. On the desktop view, we have three tabs, calendar, logged and violations. So, this is meant to capture.
Uhm, so when you go into the, into the mobile view, you&#39;ll see there&#39;s only two tabs, logged and violations. And what we want to do is, uhm, starting with this little section at the top, where I can select a shift, and then supervisor, and then click add shift.
It doesn&#39;t even have a, I think we need, it doesn&#39;t even have like a header. So we want to kind of turn this into a card.
Umm, with a little header that says, umm, with a label that says select shift type, and then I can select this shift type, and then select supervisor, and there is no supervisor I can click not applicable.
Umm, and one of the things that we&#39;ve been doing is updating these dropdowns to use view tree select. This is the plug-in that we use for a lot of our pages now.
Uhm, but I&#39;m not sure if this page uses view. If not, you may not be able to update it, which is not a big deal.
Then you come down here. You can click Add Shift. This model also needs some clean-up. It&#39;s meant to help me select a date, and then I can select, well, it&#39;s telling me that there&#39;s no schedule published for this day, so I can&#39;t log hours.
Let&#39;s go back in time and see if we can find a date where the, we have a date, so I can see, in 2021, there was a rotation, wards, selected, ehh, I&#39;m not a big fan.
And of this design, because it just, like, like, there&#39;s the fonts and everything, there&#39;s not good hierarchy, if we can do something cleaner to make it look nice, umm, so I can, once I see it, select the date and come down here, and here, these are supposed to be little pills, so I can select one of
the shift types, but it just lost the CSS and it&#39;s just showing up as a text. And down here, I can select the start time, I can say 2, 10, or, or 10 15 a.m., so, this is also a little confusing how this shows up.
And then end day, I can say next day at 8.30 a.m. And comms. And click save till the duty hour logged.
So once I logged We&#39;ll be right back. It&#39;s supposed to take me to that. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t scroll down.
So if I go back to 2021. This is not working. Supposed to let me select this week and it&#39;s supposed to show that week here.
And you can also see how the text is overlapping. And you can, this is how it&#39;s supposed to look when I select a month, when I select a week, shows me the logs on this page.
And then the violations tab is supposed to show the violations that occurred. You can click a reason and click save.
Yeah, so I think we need to do something different here, uhm, from a user experience standpoint to make it clear what we&#39;re doing.
Uhm, like, the shift app they&#39;re selecting and then add shift, clean up this interface so it looks a little bit more polished and then once it shows up on this page.
Making it, uhm, clean and well aligned and for the left and right arrows as you change, uhm, you can do, it is working but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working when I try to select a specific week.
And for this calendar drop-down, it&#39;d be nice if I can go back and change the year. So I click add shift, you can see here I can select the year and go back to 2021 easily, but on this one, it doesn&#39;t let me do that.
So if we switch out this widget to one that lets me change the years and the month, it&#39;ll save a lot of clicking.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d234b339056040b0a794a909bcdb7ef3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Updated Proposal - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 12 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Kelly. So I wanted to run through these questions with you. The first question you had was is the 86k for annual?
Yes, the term is for the term of the contract. It&#39;s an annual fee. And how long is a contract, it&#39;s up to you how long you want to commit for this by default, we do one year.
But if you want to do a multi year commitment, you can, it will be billed annually. The 325 licenses slash hours.
What this is saying is it&#39;s, we kind of had a limit limitation on the way that we create these proposals because of the software that we use.
It&#39;s meant for licenses and we also have hours down here. So, 325 is 325 active students in the platform. There is no limit on the number of hours you can use the system.
It&#39;s unlimited use usage. It&#39;s based on the number of trainees that you have. The hours really applied to this section down here which is for 50 hours of implementation.
For the top section it&#39;s all the number of licenses. Totally because of our software that we use we had to put one header so we put licenses slash hours.
As for the second proposal we&#39;re including all trainees in this in the school so the top one is mainly for the senior class.
And then this is for, sorry not the same, the top one is for the clinical students and the bottom is for all students including the pre-clinical students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b7f3a7d9187641578d5edbcb46a68c45</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design - Agile board - Jira - 12 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen. So for creating tasks in the Jira platform, essentially you would want to do that in the dev project.
So when you&#39;re logging in, you go to dev once you&#39;re in here and you&#39;ll have the boards, there&#39;s going to be the design board, development board, which is a Kanban board, and then there&#39;s the dev planning board.
I would go to the dev planning board and when you&#39;re making a new task, click create and choose feature and from feature you can give it a name but before you do that, believe it&#39;ll load the template.
It&#39;s gonna show you the module, page, tab and just summary of what you&#39;re doing and then for the module you can choose the appropriate module and sort of resembles what&#39;s on the left menu so right now you&#39;re dealing with the user profile so I&#39;ll probably create users deserves.
Clients, you can choose NA, it&#39;s not coming from a client, it&#39;s coming from it internally. This is, you can skip the sprint field and for story points it&#39;s supposed to be how difficult the task is and we.
Typically use a Fibonacci sequence and you can estimate, like, the lower numbers means it&#39;s easier task, higher numbers means a higher task, so you can kind of just put, like, a value in there.
In the future this is something that you&#39;ll get better at estimating based on the understanding. And then down here you can say where, overview, design, acceptance criteria.
So where will be the URL. So if I want to make a task here. Go into the platform and log in as John Dorian.
You can look at the left menu and start picking out different pages so I think maybe one of the better things to focus on next is I was going to say dashboard.
I think some of the other modules may be a little bit easier or more, I&#39;m not sure about it, easier.
I think focusing on something that is a little bit more self-contained is going to be the better approach here because work hours, for example, is only on the personal portals and we don&#39;t have the work hours on the admin portal.
If you update the home institution, I believe we use the same URL. So I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any side effects from that.
So you can start with maybe work hours next. Work hours is three tabs here, and I think in the sense of what Chris pointed out, for having separate tasks for each URL, it&#39;s fine.
For all three tabs here, we can treat it as one task. So I would take this URL and I would put that into this and Thanks for watching.
I&#39;ll see you next time. You can probably put in as all three tabs and you can drop in a screenshot off the page as it is right now into the, into the.
Design section. And then when you&#39;re done with making changes, you can add a loom video. This way whoever&#39;s testing it, they can watch the loom video and the design, you can rename this to original design and then that way the tester can look at the original design, watch the video and then test through
, test everything. For the acceptance criteria I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything that you want to put here as like, these are the things that I&#39;m going to work on it&#39;s, if you look at the page and you see some obvious mistakes you can, they put a bullet point, bullet, bullet list or if you&#39;re going to
use that chat GPT tool that I found that I created where it will output a bullet point list of things to improve, then you can put that in here and say these are the things I&#39;m going to focus on fixing.
Typically when we&#39;re planning out a new feature, the acceptance criteria is supposed to outline what the new feature is. In this instance, we&#39;re not really building a new feature, we&#39;re fixing problems and you&#39;re going to be writing your own list here so you can make a decision on what you want to put
here. Either the chat GPT output as a starting point, or you&#39;re looking at the page and coming up with a list of flaws that you want to fix.
And then once the first version is put in here, you can start working on it, and after you make some of these changes, I can test it and give you feedback.
And after we do this a few times you&#39;ll kind of get an intuitive understanding of the design style we use and then you&#39;ll be able to make a lot of these changes without a lot of feedback.
And we can kind of use these first like several tasks as an iterative process where you&#39;re learning how we design and what works and what doesn&#39;t work and then eventually Thanks a lot, everybody. I&#39;ll see you next week. Bye-bye. Um, it should be a pretty standardized process that we apply to all the

You click . Drop-down, sorry. You do the drop-down for here. So it&#39;s invoice. Click duplicate. You could see that Metrix product is going to be Metrix UME platform.
So we don&#39;t want to add any additional products here, and it looks like you didn&#39;t, so it&#39;s it would just have it here and then 550 licenses, it&#39;s gonna be revenue and end.
We would remove this, we&#39;re not doing implementation anymore, the custom development is removed and we&#39;re gonna simply adjust. The total here for the modules, we&#39;re gonna add up the totals for each of the modules and then list out the terms here, so it&#39;s gonna be 24 to 25.
So the totals will be 25, 50, 65. 75, 85, and then we&#39;re going to add these modules on top, 85 plus these modules, and then under the description here, we can simply list out the modules like this.

Like the top two, I&#39;m gonna eliminate as the candidates. Down here. I think we should try and make sure that the logo shows up properly.
So what if we blend, like, also like this blue, like blue background with this gradient it aligns with the website.
So it&#39;s so if we applied this color with this squiggly line with the, with the EKG line base. Basically I shouldn&#39;t call it quick squiggly line as a doctor.
So if we take this background, apply the EKG line in the back, in the back, use our photos. But this will allow us to display this.

One of the things that I wanted to point out was that when we edit this page it doesn&#39;t seem like we have a way to scroll down.
So if I&#39;m on responsive view, I can&#39;t access the buttons at the bottom. The scroll doesn&#39;t seem to be working.
If I zoom out, then I can see the buttons and I can save it. The other thing is when we edit, we&#39;ll also see there&#39;s a description field.
And if I go to the full view, you&#39;ll see that description appears under the file name. But if I click edit, I mean, inspect, and I go to the responsive view, I don&#39;t see that anymore.
I wonder if we can put that under the expiration, if there is a description to show, we can show that under here.
And while I was on the full view. I didn&#39;t notice these buttons here have a curve at the end and it kind of connects together with that.
As one continuous button with split in between them. So the curved edges are on either side. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a different type of class that we have to use for that.
If we can do the same thing for these buttons here. So it&#39;s consistent. And I think after that, this whole section at the bottom is done.
I can&#39;t. Yeah, I can&#39;t think of anything else that would need to be optimized at the bottom. And. If we can do one something here to decrease the space between the button and the search bar and the search bar itself.
The design that we want to go for is this here. You can see how this part here. Here is, has, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to work well here, but normally would say X number of documents and then you type it and it&#39;ll search you, search the the page.
But in this instance, I think with sensor assertion categories, it&#39;s not going to really work. So if we can tighten up the spacing here and then also rename this to search document type.
And lastly, I mean, Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/40c160bf326c41eeaf74cef555ae05ba</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen. Wanted to give you this video and then I&#39;m, I think we can kind of close out this bottom section here.
This new set of buttons look awesome. We click on view, it brings up this window and we can scroll close on the bottom right here.
Just want to test this so you can see that. But when I&#39;m on this window in a responsive view, I don&#39;t have the ability to scroll down.
I noticed that this happens both on the sweet alert window as well as if I click edit, I can&#39;t scroll down to hit the buttons at the bottom.
So we got, I got to zoom out and then click the button. So there&#39;s something that we can do to ensure that the scrolling works.
I&#39;m not sure if this is something that happened on this. Branch. It was always been like that. We do need to address it though.
And then the other thing is if I put a description into this field, I&#39;m not able to see that on the.
Responsive view. If I go over to the full screen, then I can see that at the underneath the file name.
So it would be ideal if under expiration. We can show the description field and then for these buttons. I wonder if there&#39;s a I mean, I&#39;m sure you know if there&#39;s a class that we can.
Use so that the rounded edges are on the first button and the last button. So it looks like they connect together here as one stack of buttons.
And if we go to the ones here. We can have the view button on the left side and these other buttons on the right side.
When we show the buttons on the right. If there&#39;s something that we can do. Use the other class so we have the curved edges.
On the first button and then the last button. Sort of like we have it on the full view. For this upload now.
Let&#39;s use the standard size so that it doesn&#39;t look good. Have normally a large compared to the other buttons. And for search category.
If we can adjust the spacing here so that it&#39;s tighter I think this kind of extra white space here we can cut down.
And if it&#39;s easy to rename this, let&#39;s put this as search document type because that&#39;s what they&#39;re searching. When we initially coded for some reason we called category, they&#39;re actually searching for document types.
And I think that kind of finishes up the bottom section here. Just checking something here. I think this first button here might be a little bigger compared to the other.
Yeah, it looks a little bit bigger than the other buttons here. We got a little break here, which is whatever.
So, I don&#39;t want to keep adding anything else to the bottom here. I think this is, this is good enough and if we can address these items, then we can continue on to the next part.
Which I would say is this edit page, like you pointed out, and then the change model. Yeah, I think that&#39;s pretty much it for this page.
Yeah, and then once we get that done, I think, ah, we can move on to the, ah, the dashboard page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b46141c88bcc43aa94ddb51700995e84</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Karen. Hope you&#39;re doing well. Had a chance to play around with this branch and I really love what you&#39;ve done so far on this page and looking at it from a mobile perspective looks like you have cleaned up some of the alignment issues.
And how everything fits into the page. Awesome work. I&#39;ve been debating in my head about the buttons. I wanted to send you a couple of pointers here.
One is when we have these long names, it does. Overlap with these icons on the right side. The the bigger thing is this is kind of it&#39;s starting to look a little different than what we do on the other pages.
And we want to I thought, like, the right side would work, but I think it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s gonna make this page look inconsistent with the rest of the mobile views.
And I&#39;ll give you an example. Like, if I go to let&#39;s say requirements. Oh, that&#39;s not a good example. Well, the main thing is that if if we stick to having all the action items in one place and then using the buttons, the bootstrap buttons, so that that&#39;s the main way that someone&#39;s interacting with
the system. We also have a color coding that we typically do. So if I go to resources, for example, and I have folders with files in it, whenever, whatever the primary action that they would take on the mobile, we want that to be this dark blue color.
And if I click on that, I can view it. And then if they&#39;re going to delete something, it&#39;ll be in dark orange color.
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s not like a lock. It&#39;s not always consistent, but the primary button, I think it&#39;s going to be dark blue and it&#39;s, the delete is always going to be the orange color.
The other ones is a little up in the air, depending on who developed it. But I made a quick mock-up here.
Here&#39;s what I was thinking would solve for this. Essentially, instead of having these icons at the top right, the main action that a person will take on a file on their mobile device is going to be viewing it.
They&#39;re not necessarily going to be editing or deleting, but they, you know, it&#39;s possible that they want, maybe they want to take a photo and attach it, so we always want to keep the buttons there.
But the primary action is going to be this view, and it&#39;s going to open up the PDF viewer and they can open the document there.
Then if they want to download it, we can have the smaller buttons for download, then the delete, and then the edit.
So these could be bootstrap buttons with icons and the view would be a longer button but it is a primary action.
And I was thinking we could do it so the view button is on the left side and there&#39;s a little bit of space and then the other buttons on the right side.
So we&#39;re kind of separating out the most commonly used button from these other buttons because we don&#39;t want them to accidentally click edit or delete and go down on the wrong path.
The delete I believe also has an alert that will prevent them from doing it something by mistake. But if we can, if we can separate separate out the most commonly used button from the other ones, it&#39;ll prevent some misclicks and that would also avoid this overlap when they have longer.
So let me know your thoughts on this. And I was also thinking, since you have these icons, like very prominently displayed, we can also make it so that when you click on the icon, it&#39;s it opens up the same view modal.
So there&#39;s way you can either do the icon or you can click on the view button. And for the icons itself, like this is very minor.
But if, if it is easy, if there&#39;s a way for us to align this. Top left, because if we center it, you can see sometimes the icons has moved down a little, it&#39;s not aligning with that top row.
But if we can center it, maybe it&#39;ll stay aligned with that top row. And then for the expiration dates sometimes it&#39;s getting cut off.
We can just remove the word ex date. You can just call it expiration and don&#39;t even need a colon because it&#39;s bad.
And that&#39;ll give you more screen real estate. Just call it expiration because, and we&#39;re showing a date so everybody will know it&#39;s a date.
And up top, the, the only thing that I was wondering if we can do is like the width of this here doesn&#39;t line up with the width of the content on here.
If there&#39;s a way that we can make it all equal width. So for example, this P doesn&#39;t align with the text up here.
Those are all Thank you all. you have these icons from other pages. So if you go to the resources page, you should be able to get the color and icons for the open and down.
All right. So random a little feedback as I was going through it. Let me know your thoughts. You can send me a Loom video or you can just type in the chat. And respond.
And, and once we get, once we get those tweaked up if you want us to test if you want me to test anything as you&#39;re working on it, you can use this channel to post links to it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8534660520d04953b22897fa76d5a38b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen, hope you&#39;re doing well.

So, on your server, I&#39;ve set up this user, Christopher Turk, to have access to some so in our administration portal, we can give individuals that are not trainees the ability to open up profiles and edit them.
So this is sort of like if you&#39;re sending a student to a hospital and you have a local administrator who&#39;s gonna manage some data, you can let them have limited access to the student&#39;s profiles.
This view has been updated recently, a few months, I like to think last year by Rio. So he created a new view where I can go in here.
Sorry, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go to this. Cole Aronson. Click edit. It&#39;ll bring us to this page where I can see the profile photo change remove first name, last name.
And you can see a new way to look at this data. I think this may be the best way for us to redo that profile page.
So if we go to this page, we can kind of use the same layout when we click edit. And I think you can probably copy and paste whatever code that we&#39;re using on this page.
So this would, we&#39;ll look at whatever feels the trainees can edit and then show that there. And I think there&#39;s also a way to give trainees the ability to edit additional custom fields.
So this page should have the code for that. But we can, let&#39;s start with seeing if we can copy this page and use it for the edit you profile page on the my profile view.
I don&#39;t think he re-created a view for this page. So that if we want to change anything there, that&#39;s something that we&#39;ll have to work on separately.
But usually when Rio makes something, it is responsive. So you can, you can kind of model it after this. Actually, it&#39;s not as responsive as it should be.
So on this page, you can, you can go to the demographics. We&#39;ll want to display it, the display the fields under the label so that we have more room.
At the top, it&#39;s also good to add some padding here so that these items are not stuck touching each other the using the full width of the photo and the button.
But it should give you something to start with.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d3538b6cbec146f4a7c567a565c9cccf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 7 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jen. I had a chance to look at these two forms and internal resident peer evaluation. The first thing that I wanted to let you know that we have to make these two forms program type and the reason why is because general surveys are used to conduct a simple survey where you&#39;re submitting information
, but you&#39;re not evaluating someone or something. And I know that, that window had a description that was incorrect. And I remember you and I had talked about a few weeks ago, this was something that was initially added as a description on the KP server because we didn&#39;t have all the ability that we
have now to do peer evaluations and program evaluations. And back when we first started the general survey was something that was used for programming evals.
And that description still stayed there. I did have the team. We changed that today to avoid this confusion in the future.
So now the general form does say it should not be used for for anything related to rotation or program. It says general feedback as a simple survey.
For peer evaluations, we have to use program. And I can change these forms over for you. Before I do that, there are assignments that were made on these forms.
So I have to remove that. So if I go to the assignments page and then search for intern, there are these two forms that were started by David Wu and Billy.
And I&#39;m assuming they were trying it out and it wasn&#39;t submitted yet. So I can delete it and change the form type.
And for the other form, there was one that was submitted as an anonymous submission. I&#39;m assuming this was the one that you&#39;re referring to as was submitted and you couldn&#39;t see where it went.
It is visible on the admin side and on the personal portal. I&#39;m logged in as a super admin. Give me a second.
Let me log in as a support user. And if I go to the personal portal, On this page, there is a filter for completed and incomplete.
So you should see it under the complete section or if you select the all option. Please let me know if it&#39;s not in there on the personal portal.
On the admin portal, you can go to the evaluation and assignments page and choose the form in the dropdown. And it&#39;ll show up here.
If you can give me the confirmation that this test, this was a test, and I can delete this, I&#39;ll go ahead and change the forms over to program type and add the appropriate roles so that you&#39;re all set to go with using this, this the evaluation types.
I also wanted to let you know that our team is working on a mobile app for metrics, and it&#39;s about halfway done, and it&#39;s going to allow the attendings and the residents to download it, an iOS and Android app, and it&#39;ll have push notifications whenever it&#39;s released.
So a couple weeks, a month ago or so, we talked about your ICU residents being able to request those evaluations and having that sent to them immediately.
We talked about how it goes via email pretty soon with the push notifications on the mobile app when you request an evaluation.
We are having that sent to the attending immediately to their app. It&#39;s, it&#39;s still going to take a little bit of time for us to get that out.
And most likely next quarter in the springtime is when we&#39;re likely going to release that, but I think this forms that you&#39;re setting up.
If you are going to be allowing them to request evaluation right now, it&#39;ll go out via email and when those push notifications come out, that would also streamline that process a little more.
Let me know if you have any questions and as soon as you confirm, I can help change this over and update the rules for you so that it can be used for peer feedback.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/23a9946ce9bf4e5184a38e33b5d63bff</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>This issue will require some testing to make sure that it&#39;s going to work as you want them to use the system.
When a client like LMU is creating their schedule, they are creating one schedule for all the students, which means they have all sites in that one schedule.
So for them to give access to all the different site administrators, we have to use a different permission than a school like MSU where they have separate schedules for each site.
So I believe we added this option here. If we say only show schedules for sites, the user has permission to view.
So if we go into here and enable this, checkbox and then add all of the different site administrators here as administrators, they will only be able to review the ones that they have permission to review.
We can try this on staging and make sure it works that way, so if you have someone that is an administrator for a particular site and that particular site has a student assigned to them on this block schedule, they would only be able to see that assignment and the other assignments will say a external
site or something like that. So enabling this checkbox and then adding some site administrators here and then logging in as an administrator to see what exactly that individual sees.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1b86c61b6590411eb44dde9cb1939899</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>2000 MKT- Memo of Commencement, Furniture Bill of Sale, COI, Security Deposit &amp; Signage - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 28 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Karthik. Hope you&#39;re doing well. I figured I&#39;d create this quick video explaining my thoughts and rather than typing everything out.
What you have on the screen here is our current office and it&#39;s it&#39;s a layout. Essentially we have this entrance here, a little closet on the left side.
On the right side here we have our conference room. Then we have this open area here with the kitchen and then these offices along the outside and it&#39;s a corner office.
We have this on the 14th floor with the big windows and nice views a few things that I want to focus on when we look for a new place and number one, we&#39;re not going to pursue this idea of buying an office so that&#39;s moving on.
What I want to focus on is finding a nice corner office that is with a view and and also has this similar layout where we have along the outside either offices or some sort of closed place people can work and then that leading into some central space where they can interact with each other.
And that&#39;s one of the things that I really like about this office. And three or four people who are working out of the office, they&#39;re in their offices or sharing an office and everybody walks out into this common area and they&#39;re having a lot of microinteractions and talking about stuff which is important
for a company like metrics where there&#39;s a lot of creative work happening. So if we have a similar layout when we&#39;re in the office, I think that natural spontaneous discussions will happen.
If it&#39;s a layout that is more closed off, then people are likely to sit in their room and only interact when they&#39;re in the conference room.
And then go home. So I think the big picture here is hoping to find something that is a corner office with a view like we have now.
And with a layout that facilitates those collaboration. And if possible, come down on the costs that we&#39;re paying since we don&#39;t have enough people in the office right now, but we&#39;ll be scaling up.
In the short term, there will be four of us that is going to be using the office in a high-performance way. model and actually one, two, yeah, four of us and within the next year, we&#39;ll likely have two more and the remote team members, about four of them will be flying into the into Philly once every
month to work out of the office and they can sort of use desks that are spread out through the office and, and, and share that space.
So those are the things that I had in my mind and looking forward to the call. And going through any options that you have and if we can find a well designed office that is a sublet that lower, that has a lower cost, that may be a good option.
And the worst case scenario. If there, if you have any ideas, once we see a few places, there&#39;s any ideas that we can re-negotiate with 2000 market for this office or for another floor with a similar model that&#39;s, that&#39;s a, a little bit more modern than we have now, that would be, that would work also
. So thank you for your help and looking forward to our call.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/88955f20f4eb467ebc49fe68238c2f28</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Today – Todoist - 28 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hello Todoist. I appreciate you collecting this feedback. I&#39;m very excited to hear about this calendar functionality. We&#39;ve used Todoist in the past and for personal tasks.
And now I&#39;m trying to roll this out to our team after a failed onboarding or adoption of Jira. We tried to use Jira for all of our tasks across the company.
It was successfully implemented for our development team, but we haven&#39;t been able to use it effectively for our business team and customer-facing team members.
So now we&#39;re trying to migrate the customer-facing team and the sales and marketing processes over to, to Doist. And we started setting up projects in here for different types of work and having a counter integration will be awesome.
And in our dream scenario, it will be nice to merge our calendar events with tasks so that at the start of a day, our team members can come into the today page and they can see all of their meetings as well as their tasks for the day.
And then, plan out, essentially plan out their day with the meetings and duration for different tasks and it&#39;ll be nice if they can say, I&#39;m going to spend, I have a meeting at 10am and then after, from 11am to 1130, I&#39;m going to work on a specific task.
And sort of make that plan and block out time and if they block out that time, having that event show up on their calendar too sort of like I have it here for my calendar where my CRM is sending out follow up.
Tasks to my calendar here. If it&#39;s happening from Todoist for any tasks that I have on the calendar and my calendar is sending any events to Todoist so I can see my tasks and events in Todoist.
And on the calendar, that would be ideal. Because a lot of the time, a lot of times that exercise of sitting in front of a computer in the morning and looking at what meetings you have and prioritizing the day leads to a better and more productive day.
And we&#39;ve been trying to kind of create that habit in all of our team members. So I hope this feedback was helpful and looking forward to trying out your calendar functionality.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/49f6af7521ec49b4a1ae6719096feb93</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So we&#39;re going to review a bug that&#39;s happening on this page here this is how the, the setup is done to show the bug.
So under the groups page, we have a set of individuals we have added to the group and we have two individuals we have set up as the group mentor.
If I log in as our NM122. We do see the evaluations page on the left side and I can see evaluations for a bunch of users here.
When I go to reports, I choose a date range from January onwards. I don&#39;t get anything here. So even though I can see the evaluations, the reports are not functioning on the evaluation summary page.
If I go to the competency page, it does pull up data. This page, ah, a couple of things that I would say we would want to address is, I&#39;m not sure what this is showing here, since there was a percentage sign either we should show the percentage or not show anything at all.
And then the other thing is, in the dropdown, we want to show the roles in italics next to the people&#39;s names.
Same thing on this page here. What we have to address is on the evaluation summary page, and this is also happening in production.
Since we&#39;re updating the permissions in this task, I&#39;m hoping that we can address it here, because this is for the same client.

Figured I sent you this quick video with my thoughts, rather than typing it all out. This is what our current office looks like.
Essentially, if I can zoom in here. We have the entrance here. This right side is a conference room. This whole place in the middle is an open area.
And then we have these offices here. And this corner one is supposed to be a larger conference room, but we&#39;re using it as an office.
And what I really like about this layout, and I&#39;m looking for something that is similar to this, is the fact that we have these smaller offices on the outside and then this common area in the middle.
It really helps with collaboration where so that if we&#39;re on a call or something, people walk out of their office and then they&#39;re interacting in the middle.
And it is something that that I&#39;ve noticed when people are working out of the office, this common area is where a lot of random interactions and discussions happen.
And if we don&#39;t have something like that, what I feel will happen is people just come into their office and stay there and we&#39;ll have the conference room and then they go home.
So I&#39;m hoping that when we look for a new office, have some sort of closed off space where people can work and then that leads to a central area where people can collaborate and discuss ideas.
Eventually we&#39;re hoping that we can turn this into a lounge area that with some couches and people can have lunch together when they&#39;re in the office.
Things like that. And I also wanted to say that we&#39;re not pursuing the purchasing idea anymore. I thought about it some more and then I want to try to find a nice All right, guys.
All right, guys. Thanks for watching!

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and you had some time to spend with your family. I wanted to take a few minutes to send you this video ahead of our meeting tomorrow so we have a chance to exchange ideas and if there needs to be some internal discussion that needs to happen
, your team can do that before the meeting. We need to push the meeting back to have that discussion. That&#39;s totally fine.
Want to make sure that the next meeting is something that allows us to get to a final number and move forward.
So we took the new framework that was proposed by Chandan and kind of combined it into one spreadsheet because I like to look at everything together so that it&#39;s easier for me to see what the numbers will be.
Essentially we removed any of the modules that the schools are not using and put all the schools on one document.
And after that we made some adjustments to the rates to get us to a place that allows us to provide the same service but also gives the schools a time to transition.
If you recall our initial proposal we had shared, year one was going to be 159 per student per year and with that model we were essentially keeping everything as is with unlimited support hours and technicals dedicated technical support, but then we had offered a second proposal which adjusted the total
rate to 129 for modules and then had separate costs for MSPE and different types of support. This kind of takes the same pricing model that we have proposed and adds in that element of transitioning from current rate to that new rate in three years.
So what we like to be is in three years is at 129, oh, 159. 9.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2511b1f6b2eb496abe33258c870d1cac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Posts - 15 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Stephanie. So this is actually a very good quote and I&#39;d love to post it. The way that I tend to address this challenge is to work with the team.
You know, back in the day when I was designing myself and I would come across a problem I would write it up or mock it up and design it and put it to the developer&#39;s queue.
Model doesn&#39;t really work well as the company grows and it&#39;s also me growing as a designer. I realized that what I notice immediately what bothers me is not always the bit, the root cause.
There are certain things that bother me a lot. For example, if something&#39;s misaligned or something that is not perfectly doesn&#39;t have the correct font hierarchy, those things bother me, but given our limited, limited I appreciate it.
Development resources. We don&#39;t want our developers to be working on fixing things that bother me. We need to be fixing things that bother our customers.
So when we do our. Design planning, what we do is we have a meeting where we have myself our design, my design colleagues and developers.
Thank you very much. well, not necessarily always developers, but different perspectives in the room. And I see certain problems, my colleagues see certain problems, and we debate.
And essentially this debate allows us to make sure that we are prioritizing what&#39;s important. And we also look at how is it impacting our customers.
Is that problem bothering one person or is it bothering all clients. That allows us to get to that root cause and tackle the bigger problems first.
It&#39;s not the individual that makes the decision, but it&#39;s that it&#39;s a team. And debating about those priorities ensures that the more important problems get solved first.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/73217dc403b148ec85f57023876c1728</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Posts - 15 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Stephanie. So this is actually a really good quote and I&#39;d love to post something about it. So at Metrix, years ago I used to be the one that designed everything.
So whenever we had a problem, I would take that design, mock it up and send it to the developers. And they would work on it because the boss gave me the task.
But that doesn&#39;t mean that it was the best or the more important problem to solve. There are certain things that bother me.
And it&#39;s a lot of times this usability issues or, or it&#39;s something that is a problem with the UI. But that doesn&#39;t, that wasn&#39;t always a root cause, but as the company grew, what I started doing was instead of me making that decision myself, we have a design meeting or a project.
Like a, a development planning meeting, a couple of different meetings actually, and where we meet as a team and in this room, in these meetings, we have different perspectives myself.
Which, I&#39;m a, I&#39;m a very design oriented person our director of UX our CIO, our CTO, and the CTO and CIO, they, are very much data-driven individuals, meaning like, they don&#39;t really care how it looks, they&#39;re they&#39;re much more into how it functions, so this means that the classic debate has, happens
where it&#39;s design versus engineering and you&#39;re debating of the priorities and why something needs to be fixed by bringing all these problems to that discussion and having a very candid discussion about, We&#39;re able to identify what&#39;s the more important problems to solve and spend our resources doing
that. If each individual was making those decisions, then, They&#39;re gonna pick out problems that bother them, but not necessarily what is best for the company or best for the best for the the customers.
And this kind of ties into, what I&#39;ve read a book the book Creative Inc. I think it&#39;s by Ed Cadmelt.
He&#39;s the founder of Pixar and the way that Pixar operates is when they&#39;re working on a new movie, each of the directors bring their ideas to what is known as a brain trust.
And this brain trust is experienced in directors and experts. And each director brings up these ideas and the people in the room will give very candid feedback to those movie ideas.
When the director hears the feedback, he can choose to ignore it or use that feedback however they want. The fact that the director doesn&#39;t have to listen to it means that they&#39;re willing to hear the feedback.
So it&#39;s sort of like that except we&#39;re not really having one director make the decision. Each person will bring problems they found from the customers or from the platform.
And then we&#39;re debating it and then making a decision on the priority and then moving into the next step. So hopefully I gave you enough to work with.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/827f0fdf8d2b4b4db69dce953052ee83</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem Pricing - Google Sheets - 27 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon everyone. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and that you had some time off to spend with your family We&#39;ve been catching up on everything on our end after the holiday and I wanted to take a few minutes to send this video over So that you have a chance to discuss it before our next meeting
And I know that our next meeting is tomorrow, so we need to push that back for internal discourse We&#39;re totally fine with doing that because I&#39;d like us to use the next meeting to finalize these numbers so that we can move forward with the S.O.W.
So this document that I&#39;m sharing is using the same framework that Chandan had proposed in the last meeting to put everything for Atalum into a similar pricing model and what we did was we put all institutions in one document and then removed any of the modules they&#39;re not using and also added the add-on
. Once we had that completed, we looked at the numbers and reviewed what we had proposed initially. This is a recommended package we had said which includes unlimited, dedicated technical lead.
And this was essentially starting at 159 for 2024-2025 academic year. And then we had a second minimum package proposal that included 129 for modules and then separate pricing for support.
Using the pricing that we provided, I made some adjustment to these numbers to be at a, at a more equitable rate for 2024 and by 2026 to get to one 159 for ROS.
Essentially that would be getting ROS to this 159 rate that we have, that we have proposed for next year. So it&#39;s giving a three year transition to get there and also to allow for this, this flexibility.
We also need to have a cap on the number of dedicated technical support that we are offering. I think that&#39;ll work well for both sides.
We&#39;ll have a cap that makes sure and we&#39;ll keep track of the hours and then I tell them if we need to go over the hours, we&#39;ll have the option to pay hourly.
So, let me review all of that together in this document. So, 2024, this column essentially gives the annual rate at 113 for ROS, 110 for AUC, 96 for ROSVET, plus the, ah, optimizer fee that says it&#39;s an add-on, and then for Chamberlain.
Chamberlain has two roles that are highlighted here. This is for site management and for gradebook. These two modules are currently not being used by the school, but based on our discussions with the school, I believe they will need that for next year.
I highlighted it. If the school decides to move forward with it, we can add it on. Otherwise, it will not be included.
So, that, these two modules will not be included and they&#39;ll be subtracted from the total.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a72fb5c51d6d40ce8561d6daf84786a9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem Pricing - Proposal</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon everyone. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and you had some time off to spend with your family.
We&#39;ve been getting back to our routine here at Metrix and today I had a chance to review this document that our team had put together and I wanted to send this video over so you have a chance to look things over before a meeting tomorrow.
And if we need to push the meeting back so you can have an internal discussion, let us know, totally fine with that.
We&#39;d love to have this finalized in the next meeting so we can move forward with the SOW. So this document is using the same model that was proposed by Chandan in the last meeting which is to have a standardized pricing across all schools.
The only thing that we have done here for the framework is to move everything over to one document, remove any modules the schools are not using, and then put the add-ons at the bottom.
For Chamberlain, I have highlighted two rows here. These are two modules that are not included in the current subscription, but the school has expressed interest in these two modules based on the BSN onboarding.
So that you can have site level permissions and then put grades into metrics. If they&#39;re added, this will be the cost.
If not, you can subtract this cost from there. So once we have set up this framework we also looked at the numbers.
We had recommended package and minimum package we had sent over. The recommended package was for $159 per student starting 2024.
And this included all of the things the TALM has now including unlimited. Technical lead support, essentially a senior level technical lead that is available for calls and emails and planning sessions as needed.
This minimum package essentially included the modules and then broke down. The support by different hours so that there&#39;s more flexibility.
What we did on this document with this new framework is kind of combined some of those concepts from the other proposal so that there&#39;s more flexibility and also allows us to get to that 159th rate by the third year.
So in this document for the recommended package we were proposing 159 here with this model the school has three years to get to that 159 and we need to start at a higher rate for this to be a a fair adjustment from our our end.
With this adjustment we&#39;ll get to 159 and then it&#39;ll be the three percent annual increase. And at the bottom here we have included the add-ons, the knowledge base included, quarterly check-ins with the schools are included.
For the the physician advisors we had proposed I think 8,000 some 8,000 and changed for 25 hours. In Tonden&#39;s updated document it was set change to 5,000.
We&#39;re more than happy to change it to 5,000 but we also had to adjust the number of hours to match the rate so that it&#39;s 15 hours.
Direct support for school leadership is currently not included but under this change metrics will start supporting any of the administrators that are using metrics via email and live chat.
There&#39;s also going to be a dedicated senior technical lead that&#39;s added that will be up to 200 hours per year.
We came up with the 200 hours based on the number of hours that was committed last year and I think this will be something that will meet the needs of Atalum&#39;s IT and this will also be used for training sessions for Atalum IT.
The standard support for in-app usage is also included. Optimizer, we haven&#39;t changed anything from the from the proposals $13,000 per year for three years.
Staging servers up to three for each school. Data warehouse server one for each. The rest API integrations included. And then for custom development, we have two rates here.
One is for the standard metrics features and the other is for integrations or infrastructure or optimization. As metrics, since we&#39;re not a custom development company, we like to avoid these institution specific changes if we&#39;re adding a new feature at a specific timeline, you know, this is we can offer
a lower rate. But if it&#39;s something that is specific to one school, then it&#39;ll be a higher rate. And these are the same numbers that we had proposed in the initial package.
So please let me know if you have any questions about this document and at the next meeting we can go into any of the additional details that need to be documented in SOW and hopefully move forward to that paperwork.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/60aba3bd44254eb5b3013fc78b5cd208</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Posts - 26 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Stephanie, I hope you&#39;re doing well and love seeing those posts from Saigon and I think you&#39;re really stepped up your what you always were great at posting those stories but I think Okay, in the last couple of, weeks, I feel like your stories have become even more engaging.
So great work and also great work on starting up your newsletter continue to success in your business. I wanted to follow up with you on a strategy that I&#39;m working on to streamline our content creation process.
Essentially, what I was going to start doing was consistently record videos. You know, start with maybe one video a week but maybe even go higher than that in the future and each week work on a clip and then my team is going to help edit it and turn it into a, you know, 30 seconds to a 2 minute clip
that we can share. But in order to post it, I wanted to get that video over to you first so that you can write a post about it and then I can have that ready for the following week.
And eventually there&#39;s also going to be interviews of customers and random people in medical education and we&#39;re going to get clips from there too.
But I want to use the same process where you can get these clips and then kind of use that to write a post.
Or if I have an idea for a post I can draft it and then you can improve it. So, what I&#39;m going to do is start uploading them to this folder, it&#39;s in our marketing drive and I created a subfolder called Tash LinkedIn Video and I have one in here that&#39;s a draft, I&#39;m going to re-record this but you can
start looking at it, the message is not going to change, it&#39;s going to be re-recorded so that I have a better clip and once I have it in there so that you don&#39;t have to go back and forth with my drive to streamline the process for you, I can put it on this board and I figured I can add it here as either
an idea or as a draft status and then once you have put it on an actual post, you can update it as date or week and week here so that I know it&#39;s ready.
So I was hoping that we can start with cleaning up this board. If you can mark anything that you&#39;ve already done.
As done status or add the dates going forward. This way we only have things on here that&#39;s post to be done in the future.
I was thinking the easiest way for us to handle this is once you mark anything as done, I can add it here as draft and then once you, once you write it, you can enter the date and the week.
And once I post it, I can mark it as done and it will disappear off the list. So that way, both of us are aware of the status and we can asynchronously work.
So I put it into the draft with the video link inside of it. So for example, if I were to set this up, it would be new, say chat GPT or medical education.
And then I&#39;ll put the link here. And the status would be draft or I can do idea whatever is easier for you.
And once you update it to the date with the date I&#39;ll know that it&#39;s ready. And then once I post it, I&#39;ll change the status to done.
And then we can filter by in progress. And to do to keep this list short. Let me know your thoughts.
I&#39;m open to other ideas. I wanted to make sure that I have a easy way to get videos to you one week in advance.
And then you can help incorporate that into the post for the following week.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0146b3545d234ddd84d8f99da95dec08</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMUCVM - CSV Overlaps - Google Sheets - 13 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So create a filtered view on the output, selected this student, and on the second one, do the same thing.

Let me zoom in a little bit. So this document shows So, a little overview of us as a company, whenever you&#39;re purchasing a platform from us it is an annual subscription.
It includes support for all of our administrators, you have a live chat option at the bottom. The bottom right that you can click on and ask a question whenever you&#39;re stuck and our team can reply to you.
And even if you&#39;re not logged into the system, you&#39;ll get an email back and you can continue that conversation via email.
We also provide a training as part of the onboarding process and then if you need additional training it is included as part of the pricing.
The only time we charge for training is we want us to come on site and do some sort of live training on campus.
Knowledge base is also included. We provide a full knowledge base that includes over 400 articles on the different modules and we also include an AI powered chat bot that you can use to ask questions.
It&#39;ll reply and provide custom content from the knowledge base. All of our descriptions include updates, we roll out updates a couple of times a month so as new features are released you&#39;ll get that and then every month we also, well not every month but almost every month.
We do a webinar for all of our administrators where we cover different topics and you&#39;ll get invites to that. That includes some training as well as review of the new features that were released.
This provides an overview of some of the modules that we have included. I think for one of the packages, we&#39;re including everything and the other package is for the clinical and the MSPE if you want to migrate away from the current platform at the end of the year.
For onboarding, we like to break this up into projects. Each project lasts about three months and this this allows us to have weekly meetings and each of those weekly meetings will cover specific process and there&#39;s going to be some homework assignments.
We had to set up clean set up some of the data and then we come back and we review the data, do the training.
For example, if you&#39;re setting up your evaluations, we&#39;ll go over the evaluations module and one meeting, give you a task to set up one or two of the templates.
In the next meeting, we will review it and make sure that it&#39;s configured properly to be automatically assigned. And during these meetings, we also discuss processes across the organization and how it can be implemented to maximize engagement.
And this lists out all the different modules that we offer and we have two packages that we have included in this proposal.
The first one is for replacing the clinical process and operations related to scheduling evaluation. The second one is for the full system.
We also provide a staging server for each of our clients which allows you to do testing if you need to, especially if you want to do any sort of integrations.
Knowledge base, quarterly check-ins are included. Let&#39;s see.

Essentially, we want to export the full screen versions as well as the split versions with audio corrected by Riverside.
Side. That way we have the full interview in both formats with the audio fixes being done directly in Riverside. So what I did was go to the editor and then do a couple of quick quick.
Things. One is I watched the interview and I remove anything that needs to be removed, such as the discussions that happened in the beginning anything at the end.
So this is something that I can. And I or Marcus can help with. Once those sections are removed using the text editor on the left, we could create the first export, which is removing any of the speakers that shouldn&#39;t be on there.
Then setting up the you can also remove the silences. So I kind of go down this list here, remove silences.
Remove speakers that shouldn&#39;t be on the clip. Then I create my first version, which is going to be the split video.
And even if you don&#39;t see it at the bottom, It&#39;s okay. When you export it, it should show up as split.
And we don&#39;t need to do anything with the background. No captions, no logo. Then click export. And we&#39;re going to choose the 4K version, normalize audio levels, remove background noise, and then do the export.
And it&#39;ll take about 10 minutes in the sense of an email saying that the export is ready. Once that is done, we come back to the editor and we do a second export where we do all the same things, but we do it as a full screen export.
Each version will have each speaker show up on the screen full screen every time they speak. So this is not going to be split between the two, but we go through the same process that we do here.
You might hear Alexander in the background. So when we do the export, we do the second export. Now we&#39;ll have two versions that are noise noise, the background is removed, audio levels are normalized, one with split view and one with full and both of them will have the silences removed.
This, this will allow us to export and have two clips that we can use for editing outside of Riverside. So I&#39;ll go back here and you can see how it shows up on this page here.
Full length. I labeled them split silences removed. Full screen silences removed. And both of them are 3110. And then I can download these.
Now, we have two clips that we can work with where the noises are normalized and backgrounds sound is removed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a218cc51bdde4c9f92a6efff1e6021dc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem 2024 - Packages - Google Docs - 27 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you had a great holiday and that you had some time off to celebrate with your family.
I wanted to send this video over ahead of our meeting, so you had a chance to review this document. It&#39;s the same pricing model that we went over last time, essentially.
The new framework that Chandan had proposed where we&#39;re pricing for all institutions, all institutions under a TALM in one model.
And the only thing that we did was move it over into one document and adjusted the rates to match, to be in line with what we want the pricing to be in three years from now, because that&#39;s the transition period that we had discussed.
We need to start at a higher rate and we need to end up at least at the lowest rate that was proposed in our initial proposal.
So we had set 24, 20, 2024 to 2025. We had proposed 159 per student per year. And with this rate adjustment, we&#39;re proposing that we off, we do this transition period where year one and year two, it&#39;s kind of transitioning towards that new model.
And we&#39;re ending up at 159 for Ross. And for this document,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/626fca7f2a4543ffb71c603c22211d83</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Trinity Medical Sciences University Medtrics Proposal - PandaDoc - 15 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to take a moment to review this proposal in this video so that You understand everything that&#39;s on here So this is a PDF that I&#39;ll be sending over to you and Inside this, it&#39;ll provide an overview of all the different services that we offer.
Zoom out a little bit. So this includes all the different modules. As well as the different services that we offer.
And then for each of our clients as part of the subscription, you receive live support in the system itself. So at the bottom right of each screen, there&#39;s a little chat.
That window you can use to reach our team. And if you&#39;re asking us a question and you leave the platform, you could still get that response in an email.
In in-depth training, this includes training during the onboarding process, as well as a additional training as needed. Anytime you need additional help, you can reach out to us and schedule a meeting and get more training.
Same thing if there&#39;s a staff turnover, there&#39;s no additional cost for training. The only time we charge for training is if you are in need of on-site training where we come on campus and do a session.
Knowledge Base itself is something that is part of the system. There&#39;s over 400 articles in there. There&#39;s also an AI-powered chat interface that allows you to ask questions.
That gives you personalized answers from the Knowledge Base. All modules also include continuous updates. Every month we release some updates to some of the modules and then we also have a webinar where we review those.
The next few pages goes into the modules, a brief summary of it, and we covered this in our demos, but if you have any additional questions, please let us know.
For onboarding, we typically do onboarding as projects. Each project is broken up into weekly 30-minute meetings, where we have a team on our end which includes a physician that meets with you, and we go over a specific module, train you on it, and then also give you feedback. The next meeting we review
that task and implement it. This also includes a lot of discussion on internal processes and how we can help improve that to maximize the engagement.
Next is a list of modules that we have included as part of this subscription. And there&#39;s also some additional services that we&#39;re including here.
Every client gets a staging server. This is automatically created and you have a copy of your product. You can use this staging server to try different setup or integrations and then once it&#39;s ready, you can apply that to the production environment.
We also provide a knowledge base. And a customer success meeting. This AI powered one, this is actually not included. It&#39;s something that is not needed.
If you want us to directly support students and faculty members, we are providing a AI powered chat interface which allows you to have us handle some of those how-to questions.
But I think most schools will have their own internal process for handling it. If you want us to handle this, there is a fee for this and there&#39;s also a each resolution fee for handling it.
But that&#39;s something that I think you&#39;ll be fine without if you already have an internal process. So I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll adjust that before I send it.
For customer support, we&#39;re open 8am to 8pm. There&#39;s a chat, email, phone, and then obviously scheduled Zoom conferences if needed.
We don&#39;t take ownership of any of your data, all of it is owned by your school, and if you ever choose to leave Metrix, that&#39;s something that we can take with you.
So, the first package here is for clinical and MSPE, and this includes our learner and educator portfolios, calendar, clinical schedules is your block-based scheduling, diagnosis and procedures.
Seizure logs, site management for all of your affiliate sites and tracking their profiles, onboarding, this is for collecting any sort of compliance paperwork, like immunization records, resources for delivering any sort of documents for you.
Or the students as they go through different rotations. And then the onboarding will allow you to collect it and the compliance module is something that&#39;s used for tracking various documents in the system.
This could be for compliance or for any sort of additional paperwork that needs to be added for you. For the students or faculty members.
Evaluations module, great book. And then the MSPE is a stand-alone module that includes two components. One is for the chart automation, the second one is for the letter rock automation.
And then finally this would require two onboarding projects. This would be one for the MSPE and the other one for the clinical implementation.
And that&#39;s, this is, this would be the total for all of that. Please let us know if you have any questions and this is our recommended package for the clinical and MSPE.
If anything needs to be adjusted, we&#39;re more than happy to work with you on that. Especially if there&#39;s any budget limitations.
Meaning like, I think for example if you don&#39;t need to do onboarding in the system, we can certainly not include the training onboarding for the paperwork.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9de8995a28d74b90b975cb65f81313ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem Pricing - Google Sheets - 24 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Chandan. We&#39;ve taken that spreadsheet that you had shared with the updated pricing structure and we combined all of them into one document.
It&#39;s the same model that you proposed simply laid out in one sheet with only the modules that the schools need.
I wanted to highlight the key things that we had tweaked here. One is the pricing. So we definitely need to have a slightly higher adjustment during this transition period.
And in year three, we like to be at 1.50. For Ross again, 1.59 was the pricing that we had provided as part of the recommended package for 2024.
And this is now giving the school three years to adjust to get there. And we can also show here, shown here the adjustment for each year.
And then after the, we reach this level then it&#39;s three year increase and this will be locked for another two years.
Essentially the five year pricing proposal. For AUC, similar model, they&#39;re not going to be using the outbound module. For Ross VET, it&#39;s not including the MSPE module and it doesn&#39;t include the outbound module.
For Chamberlain, there are two modules that are highlighted here. These two modules are currently not used by AUC. Based on the discussions that Chris had with the teams, it sounds like they want to add this in the future.
Site management may be necessary to set up permissions for the 23 different sites that BSN has. And then for Greatbook, I believe there was a need to put grades in the system.
Currently, that&#39;s not part of the package. We&#39;ve included here, if this decision is made, and the school wants to add those on, you have the pricing.
And then for the add-ons, we&#39;ve included the optimizer pricing here. For the physician advisor pricing, the initial proposal had 25 hours for 8,750.
You had adjusted it to $5,000 for 25 hours. We need to keep that price, hourly pricing the same instead of increasing the total amount I&#39;ve adjusted the.
Number of hours, 15 hours, and then afterwards it can be paid hourly for custom development. We have $200 per hour for metrics features and then $400 per hour for any.
Thank you. Thank you. Custom endpoints that need to be created for integration or any custom infrastructure that needs to be maintained for a Talon or for any rules that need to be added for optimizer and everything else is included.
And one of the changes that we&#39;re making going forward, is we will be providing direct support for school leadership through our email and live chat.
So, essentially if the deans or one of the administrators want to reach us and ask us questions about how to use something in the system, they will be able to do that.
And then we&#39;ll also be starting these quarterly check-ins with each of the schools with a Talam IT team member on the call.
So please look this over and let me know if you have any questions about this and we can continue this review in the next call.
I&#39;m hoping that at the next call we can finalize these numbers and move forward with the ESOW.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c66b6038a43b482c9d5d24155b31fa4a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem Pricing - Google Sheets - 24 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Chandan. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving. I wanted to create this video and send this over along with this spreadsheet, so you had a chance to review it with the team ahead of us meeting on Tuesday.
With Chris&#39;s help, I turned that spreadsheet that you sent over into a file that contains pricing for all schools and it also includes the add-ons at the bottom.
Essentially, it&#39;s the same model that you proposed laid out into one spreadsheet so we can see everything together. Also, we&#39;ve excluded any of the modules that the schools are not using.
A couple of the tweaks that we made here is we have to start with the pricing adjustment to be a little bit higher than what was proposed.
Because we need to be at at least $159 for Ross by year three. And as a reminder, that was the price that we had proposed for $24.25.
2024 by 2025 as a recommended package. So this adjustment is now giving the school three years to get to that amount.
And we&#39;re also setting some caps on the support hours as part of this adjustment. And at the bottom here, I&#39;ve specified that we would have up to 200 hours of dedicated technical support and after 200 hours, it&#39;ll be $300 per hour.
Again, this is senior technical support. This is not our standard support. It says if Chris or someone of our developers need to provide support, that&#39;s what the 200 hours will be going for.
The regular support hours are not being calculated. If the deans want to re-talk to us and ask questions about something, that will be handled as part of our regular support which we are also now including.
It was not part of the package when we signed this agreement four years ago. But now we&#39;ll be providing regular support and have 200 hours of dedicated senior support hours.
The other adjustment here is the modules for ROS includes the outbound module. For AUC doesn&#39;t include the outbound module and for ROSVET we are not including MSPE and we&#39;re not including outbound.
Chamberlain, there are two modules that I&#39;ve highlighted here. These modules are currently not being used but there has been discussion for adding them because the BSN program may need site-level permissions so the site management module will be required and then they, there was also discussion about
grades getting added into metrics. The CUTN can make the final decision on whether you want to include these but if they do decide to move forward this will be the pricing for that and for our, the physician advisor for academic strategy and planning, we had proposed 25 hours for that at 8,750 and you&#39;re
a document you had adjusted that to 5,000. We&#39;re happy to bring this down to 5,000. But. Per year, but the pricing has to remain the same.
So we changed that to 15 hours and then $400 per hour afterwards. And then for custom development, for any metrics features, it will be $200 per hour.
And then for integration or infrastructure. That is specifically built for a Talam. It would be $400 per hour. Again, we are not a custom development firm.
So we like to make sure that things that we build are standard. And that&#39;s why if we want to add any new features to the platform, and it&#39;s something that you want to do in a certain timeframe, it&#39;ll be $200 per hour.
But if we need to dedicate resources to build specific endpoint for integration or create some sort of infrastructure change for a Talam, then we&#39;d have to charge a higher fee for that.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this. This is something that I believe a lines with what we had talked about in the last call.
The main points here are we have to have a higher starting point for the transition and we need to end up in three years at 159 and then we can do the 3% increase after that and this proposal is for five years.
And I&#39;ll lock it down for these rates for five years. And we have also included the curriculum AI assistant functionality in this.
This is something that was built and also I believe the ROS team would benefit from this. Any other AI modules that are added in the future.
Is something that will be an add on. The schools can decide if they want to add that on or if they don&#39;t want it, they don&#39;t want it, they don&#39;t have to pay for it.
And this, this AI assistant assistant for curriculum mapping will be included as part of these prices.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d28da1636a164d6e94d06584d51bfe1d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>iOS recording - 12 Nov 2023</pre></td><td><pre>I would like you to pretend to be a difficult patient in the emergency room and I want you to come up with a scenario where you&#39;re being a challenging patient and I&#39;m going to pretend to be a medical student interviewing you and we would like to work through this conversation and you like I like you

I&#39;ve been messing around with the new chat GPT app and I want to share something really exciting that that I feel like we can use for training for sales.
Chat GPT has a new functionality that allows us to talk to it and it&#39;ll respond and speak back to you.
So, I want to give you an example of what I, what I was trying out. So, I&#39;m going to click this button.
It&#39;s on the app. It&#39;s a little button that starts the chat functionality. Good afternoon. I&#39;d like you to pretend to be a medical school clerkship dean.
And I&#39;m going to pretend to be a sales rep at a SAS company trying to sell you an error. Good afternoon.
As the clerkship dean, I&#39;m interested to hear what your software offers. How can it benefit our medical. Schools educational programs.
Actually, let me ask you how are you currently managing your clerkship programs? I&#39;m especially interested in hearing about scheduling evaluations.
And case logging. Currently, we&#39;re using a mix of digital and manual systems for scheduling. We rely on a combination of spreadsheet software and a dedicated scheduling tool.
Evaluations are mostly conducted using online forms and surveys, which are then manually compiled. As for case logging, students mainly use a digital system, but there&#39;s still a significant amount of data available. We&#39;re definitely looking for ways to streamline these processes.
How does your software address these areas. Before I get into that, tell me more about scheduling. How are you scheduling the core clerkships and the electives.
For core clerkships, we schedule them on a rotation process throughout the year. We use a digital calendar system where students can see their assigned rotations.
This system accounts for required clerkships and balances the number of students in each rotation. Electives. Students are a bit more flexible.
Students can choose their electives based on interest and availability. They submit their preferences through an online form and we manually assign them based on those preferences and available slots.
Our process can be quite time consuming and complex, especially when accommodating last-minute changes or special requests. Our goal is to make this process more efficient and less manual.
How can your software help with this? Well, that must be very painful to have to manually schedule all those things.
Yes, it can be quite challenging, especially with a large, number of students and limited slots for certain rotations or electives.
It&#39;s a balancing act to meet educational requirements while accommodating student preferences. An automated or more streamlined system would definitely help reduce, ,the workload and improve accuracy.
How does your software approach these scheduling challenges? I will get into that soon, but I also want to know are your evaluations tied to your, schedules or are you manually sending out evaluations?
Our evaluations aren&#39;t directly tied to the scheduling system. We manually send out evaluations at the end of each rotation or clerkship.
The process involves tracking which students are in which rotations. And then sending the appropriate evaluation forms to the students, faculty, and sometimes patients.
This manual aspect can lead to delays and sometimes even missing evaluations. A system that automatically triggers evaluations. So, when you have a preceptor that are working with your students, are you able to get a- It sounds like you&#39;re about to share how your software might address these challenges
. I&#39;m eager to hear about the features your software offers. Especially regarding the integration of evaluations with scheduling and streamlining the manual processes we currently face.
Could you tell me more about that? I will soon. So when you have students going to different hospitals, do you know which preceptors they will work with in advance?
Or is that something that is unknown until the student gets there? For most rotations, we assign students to specific preceptors in advance.
This information is included in their schedule. Knowing the preceptor assignments beforehand helps us tailor the evaluations and ensure that both students and preceptors are prepared for the experience.
However, there are instances, especially in elective rotations or in certain hospitals, where the specific preceptor assignment might be determined closer to the start date or even upon the student&#39;s arrival.
This variability can make tracking and evaluation more complex. How does your software manage such situations? Do you think your students will benefit from being able to request or initiate an evaluation from a preceptor they worked with?
Absolutely. That would be a beneficial feature. Allowing students to request or initiate evaluations could ensure more timely and relevant feedback.
It would also encourage greater engagement from both students and preceptors. In the evaluation process, this could lead to more accurate assessments of their performance and experiences.
How does your software facilitate this kind of student-initiated evaluation process? So, as you can see, it&#39;s very good at pretending to be a Dean and it also makes up scenarios and if we essentially have each person learn how to ask these questions and drive the conversation, it will allow multiple</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/995cbecb419c4b93ab242d605d81d7dc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Karen.

I want to go over this design that our team put together for this min max feature that we&#39;re going to add when a rotation is being created in metrics.
This is under system setup. We&#39;re going to have a section called capacity and this capacity section will allow us to select one or more roles.
So, in this example, we&#39;re using medical student, MS2, MS3, and so on, what this applies to medical students, vet students, and each time, Bye.
When I select a rule, I can define min and max and then add that rule to the section. The system will allow us to add multiple rules so I can have a different requirement for MS2s, a different requirement for MS3, and save all of that.
Once it&#39;s saved, when I&#39;m creating a new schedule and open up a window to make an assignment, when I select a particular assignment, it will tell me how many students are assigned for that block.
Well, it tells me how many students are allowed as a min and a max for that block and if a student is getting added and the capacity has been met, will also show an alert.
It says adding an edit. I think adding this trainee to this rotation will exceed the capacity of five and then we can click add trainee anyway and then continue.
Please let me know if this handles all the required functionality and if there&#39;s anything else that we need to discuss.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/426566b0d1c5499dbdd4594e027a06e3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Stephanie.

However, if you look at the AGMP primary care program, you can see how it works. So if we go to the resources folder, under rotation resources, we&#39;ll have a subfolder for every single rotation that you have at this in this program.
And inside of each of these folders, we can upload files or add a hyperlink. Once these are added to the folder, metrics can email them out to the trainees.
Based on the rotation schedule. So under the system setup settings. There&#39;s a curriculum section to send curriculum to trainees seven days before the start of the rotation.
So if folders are filled with content for each rotation, then metrics will email those out. This is a rotation specific files.
I believe what you&#39;re asking is more site specific files. Under sites, you do have a way to attach documents. The way that this is done is by opening up a site and adding files to this.
Site documents are not emailed to the students. It&#39;s something that they can access in the system if they&#39;re given access to the site&#39;s page and they can download those files from there.
I&#39;m not sure if this site management was also purchased for Chamberlain. I wanted to give this information to you and then if either of these are helpful we can explore setting this up and having a pilot.
And for the, if you want the site documents emailed out to the students, there is a feature that we&#39;re planning.
I don&#39;t have a timeline for it for medical students. Essentially, medical schools have a similar challenge where they have multiple rotations at a site and the documents that are being shared are going to be for the site and not specific to each rotation.
So that is a limitation of the resources right now, but there is a feature that we&#39;ll be doing in the future that a feature that will allow institutions to create site specific documents under resources and have those emailed out.
I hope this was helpful in understanding how the documents can be set up in metrics.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/426dcfe1936d4cb98f9178c09b8380e5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Undergraduate Medical Education</pre></td><td><pre>Hello everyone. In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at the medical education journey for doctors. We&#39;re going to specifically focus on the undergraduate medical education, but I want to start with the overall journey first.
Guide to doctor hierarchy. So when a medical student, well, let&#39;s start a little bit earlier. When a college student decides that he or she wants to go to medical school, they would first take a bunch of prerequisite courses and then take the MCAT, which is the first exam that you had to take to go down
the path of becoming a physician. So you would first take the MCAT. If you do good and you have good grades, you&#39;re going to get into medical school.
Medical school is four years long and then after medical school, you will have to get into a residency. Medical schools are held hosted by universities and then after you graduate, you&#39;re going to become a resident in a hospital.
So a residency is when you learn to practice medicine independently and take care of patients. You also have your first year residency is often referred to as the internship or the intern.
A lot of times people just call it residency for everything but if you ever heard hear the word intern or internship that&#39;s for the first year residency.
Residency can be 2 to 7 years and then after finishing residency you can further sub-specialize and do a fellowship. So let&#39;s say you want to become a trauma surgeon.
You would first do 5 years of residency and then you would do a fellowship. Fellowship in trauma surgery to specialize in trauma surgery.
Then after you finish either your residency or your fellowship, because fellowship is optional, not everybody takes fellowship, goes into fellowship, you become an attending physician, trained physician, practice practicing their specialty.
So these terminology, resident and attending came into place from years ago, about a hundred years ago, when doctors in training used to live at the hospital and they were residents of that hospital and the attendings where individuals that would come in during the day make rounds and make, put in their
recommendations. So they were called attendings. They&#39;re attending the hospital and then leaving while the residents live there. So now let&#39;s take a look at medical schools specifically and take a deeper dive because that&#39;s where a lot of our clients that&#39;s where a lot of our current work is happening
in the medical school world. So for this particular example that mapped out the four years of medical school and we&#39;ll look at each of these pieces one by one.
The first thing that I want to start off with, there are two types of physicians in the United States. There are the osteopathic physicians and the allopathic physicians.
So if you look at the initials after a physician&#39;s name, you&#39;ll see either an MD or a DO. For example, my initiation.
These initials are MD and because I graduated from an allopathic school. If I had graduated from an osteopathic school, I would have had the letters DO.
There are slight differences in their training, but for the sake of metrics and anything in healthcare, we can treat them as the same.
So, both there&#39;s allopathic medical schools and there&#39;s osteopathic medical schools. Both require the MCAT, which we don&#39;t really care about from a metrics standpoint because we don&#39;t deal with pre-medical students, we only deal with medical students.
So, we&#39;re, here we have four years of medical school. The first two years of medical school, first, second, are classroom-based training.
So, what that means is they go to a university, there are some, behind different courses in the first year such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry.
You can either take the courses, ah, like this, or some schools will teach it based on organ systems. They may have one course for the cardiovascular system.
Another course for the neurological system. The structure of the courses don&#39;t matter. What matters from a metric standpoint is that these are classroom based training.
So we have anatomy course where you have a lectures anatomy, you may have labs in anatomy, and you may also have small group sessions in anatomy.
All of this happens on a university campus. In metrics, we handle these classroom based schedules on our session schedules which is part of our curriculum module.
Well, it&#39;s under the curriculum module. But it&#39;s a separate add-on if you want to do scheduling in metrics. So this is for the first two years and the second year you may take more advanced courses such as pharmacology, pathology, pathophysiology and so on.
Then you would take your USMLE Step 1 if you&#39;re an osteopathic, if you&#39;re an allopathic doctor which is the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1 which is the Part 1 that&#39;s taken after your second year.
If you&#39;re an osteopathic doctor, or medical school, you would go and take the complex. After your classroom training is all done, you&#39;re going to be starting your clinicals.
So this is where a little, it&#39;s a little confusing because some schools, well, all schools will call it clerkships, but it&#39;s, there&#39;s some interchangeable language here in the world of metrics.
Clerkships are actual apprentice based training model. So let&#39;s say I am a medical student that finished a second year medical school and I want to start my clinicals or clerkships.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/04cca4af354642b18c708a80459b488a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Zeni - Modern Finance Team For Startups - 7 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Alejandra.

Actually, You can click the download button at the top, and then accounts by class, it will do accounts by classes.
And then snapshot, quarters, and then we&#39;re going to do it. We&#39;re going to do whatever quarter we need to run the report for. So from here to here, and then we can leave the year to date total. And then run the report. And then we can download the report to a PDF. I&#39;m going to open it up. This is a quarterly
report. And then we can send that over to the, ah, investor.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bf29cc021a0e49d1a67288b53651f737</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 8 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, Mike. So MSU&#39;s VED program, they want to use metrics to track how many students, maximum number of students, and the minimum number of students that are allowed into each rotation.
So, if I go to system setup rotations, we have a list of rotations. If I click edit on one of those, we want to add a section.
Somewhere in here, maybe we can expand it and into the settings here, it can be capacity and settings. And in the capacity, we&#39;re going to have actually we should have a separate section called capacity.
And in that, we want to be able to select a role and then for that role, define the number of students as a minimum and the number of students that are maximums.
So it&#39;s sort of like a like one of these drop downs, you select the role and you click add. When you add, you&#39;ll see two fields, one for the minimum number of students or minimum trainees and maximum trainees.
And you can put a number into it. So potentially you could put in like we want to let them choose one or more roles.
So I can say MS3s, they&#39;re going to have minimum of two and maximum of five. MS4s. Minimums two and maximum of five.
We should, we can, we can also let them enter-let me see if I can- I can show you something here that you can borrow the design from.
If you click into Lottery, Blocks, you can see Roles, Allowed, and then, really, here, we really have a number of slots.
So, it would be instead of number of slots with minimum trainees and another field called maximum trainees, and then, you can click Add.
And once it&#39;s added, you can do it again. So, at the bottom, we&#39;re capturing how many students of each type we can have but this is a multi-select, which means that if I say five students for MS2, 3, or 4, that means, you can have a total of five, but you would only, you would, you can have a mix of
twos, threes, and fours. But if I put this as twos MS2s and five, that means I would, I can have a maximum.
Of five five MS2 students. So that&#39;s something that we want to add to the rotations page. Second part of that is on the clinical schedules.
If I open it up, when I try to schedule a rotation, Thank you for your attention. And I select it.
I want to be shown. Open this one up. If I do this and I choose a rotation, as soon as I select it I want to be shown somewhere on the page.
How many, what&#39;s the minimum maximum for each of the roles for this rotation? So probably you can probably show it right under here, under the name, and if I click add, if I&#39;m at capacity or above capacity, I want to be shown an alert like this that says over capacity, and say, adding this trainee to
this rotation will we&#39;ll put this rotation at over capacity, and if, So we really want to show the alert if you&#39;re going above the capacity.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0c1ed1d15b5f41faa11c45f9482f2fa4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, while I was at the conference, I had a lot of interactions with curriculum people and I&#39;ve been thinking more about the curriculum module as well as the updates that we&#39;ve been doing for the AI functionality.
So if you look at the AI page that we created, we currently have that on the curriculum map page as mapping.
It&#39;s, you can select a course and then they can, you can see the course and then in inside each course you can see different sessions.
What I want to do with this is use this design to replace our current sessions page because we have a lot of things in here that is old code that&#39;s very clunky and hard to use.
With this new design, we can do a lot of that and I want to walk you through this and I&#39;ll show you the updates that we want to make.
So if I choose this course here, I can see the list of sessions and inside of the sessions, I have different columns that shows you that it&#39;s a lecture type, the, the, the the time, the duration and then if I expand that, I&#39;ll see, I&#39;ll see the session objectives.
And I expand that, I can do the mapping inside of it, which is much more intuitive than our current page where I go into here and I create a new session.
And then once I create the session, I have to go to the objectives tab, create the objectives and I go to the mappings tab and do the mappings.
It&#39;s very, too many clicks to get this done. What I like to, what I like for us to do is if we look at the session details here, we can see it has session, the type, the code the title, under the title we have a description, the session leaders, theme, the schedule groups, Oops.
And venue, all of this as well as these buttons showing up when I look at a session. So what I want to do here is think about when I expand a session, when I, when I expand a question, of course, and I see these sessions underneath it how we can display all of that detail.
So for example, we have the name, the description, the session code here, the type and then we don&#39;t have leaders, themes, schedules, groups, venue, and the buttons.
So we gotta get creative and try to put that information in here. I&#39;m thinking that for things like schedule will want to show what the schedule is, but for things like leaders and groups, we can probably show, like, some sort of icon to indicate it.
Total groups, and then when you click on it or hover over it, it&#39;ll show the details. And when, venue, we probably want to show it also.
And these icons, we can show us small icons with just a logo on it. So that way in this row, we have all that detail shown, sorry, right down here.
For each of these sessions, we&#39;ll have all that detail shown. So I want to, I want you to think about how we can put that in there.
And then when I click on expanding it, I want to get rid of this, does this diagram here because it&#39;s not really showing it&#39;s not going to do a lot of justice with the screen real estate.
Instead I started doing something like this. So I want to have expandable sections so that when I click on this session, I&#39;ll have a section where I can open up and I&#39;ll see all of these objectives like I have it right now.
And then I can do the mapping just the same way that it&#39;s done in this page, but I also want to show keywords inside the keyword section.
I&#39;ll be able to do the keyword mapping. So you can see here keywords. I can do a look a way to manage keywords.
And I also want to have instructional methods, assessment methods, and there I can add that materials and then schedules. So the idea here is as a faculty member, I can just keep clicking expand and then work on my session, add more content, close it, then open up a new one.
I don&#39;t have to switch tabs. Everything is self-contained. So a couple of things for you to think about is how we can fit more information here.
And then also how we can expand each of these sections to show all the information related to a session so that we don&#39;t have to go from tab to tab.
We can possibly for sessions, I mean, schedules. Like we can possibly show, use a modal that we have now, like you expand it and it&#39;ll show you what&#39;s scheduled, and then you click edit, it&#39;ll bring up a modal.
Yeah, I think it&#39;s gonna, it&#39;s gonna take a few rounds of back and forth, but what I want to do is mock something up and then go through with Rio.
And have him work on this, because if we can get this done, then we can eliminate a lot of these old pages which nobody likes using.

Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/20bce105fefb4edebf236642058de97f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem 2024 - Google Docs - 30 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So for this second package, I want to run through this and explain my thinking here. This is the standard that we presented to them, and the understanding is that Atollum&#39;s primary objective here is to make sure that they&#39;re controlling I&#39;ll see you in the next video. cost and we want to give them something
that allows them to control the cost, but also takes away some of these nicer things that we have for lowering the cost for the modules.
Essentially, they will have the modules they have now for 129. It will not include any of the AI updates. They will get the standard updates, but anything that we update that is includes AI, it will be disabled for us.
For MSPE to bring them down to 129, what I&#39;ve done here is pull that out as a separate module and then price it based on the volume.
The volume of letters that they&#39;re generating. In the other format we had, it being paid as a module for all four years, here we&#39;re saying it&#39;s going to be for each letter that they generate, it&#39;s going to be $50.
And for the optimization service, again, they had an issue with the cost to bring that price down, we&#39;re saying that as long as the, with the existing rules, it would be done at $13,000 per year.
If they need to do additional development and build new rules or change existing rules, they&#39;ll be charged the hourly rate for development.
The infrastructure staging. Data warehouse. This is something that essentially for us to just host this, we&#39;re not really doing any work is maintaining it.
They would be paying this much if they need to do any work. And if you work on that server, update anything, it will be under the custom development fee.
The custom development fee itself, it&#39;s 200 we may want to, I&#39;m considering whether we want to break this up into two types of custom development.
When I put in 200, it was more for features that we want to add to the system that they may be paying for, which we&#39;re benefiting from and they&#39;re benefiting from where we want them to.
We want us to be paid for it, but it&#39;s going to be released to all clients, not simply for Atalum.
The other type of custom development that they come up with is specific to Atalum, which is what I can do here is have a higher rate for Bye-bye.
So this way it&#39;s a higher rate for anything that is specific to a TALM, lower rate for features. Since it&#39;s going to benefit us too.
The consulting, that&#39;s that. And what I was thinking here was also adding adding a line item here similar to what I did here for 50,000 per year for, for those quarterly meetings with the leadership.
I had to think about number, but anyway, this is would be a way for them to purchase these hours in advance so that they can get as a slightly discounted rate.
And that&#39;s what&#39;s happening at the IT level. So there is no technical lead. All support issues would go through the regular support channel and they would have to escalate it.
We would have to escalate it to a senior person, like we do for other clients and we would not be.
We would not be having regular weekly meetings unless they purchase these hours in advance. So $50,000 for 200 hours, they&#39;re getting it at $50 discount from our standard $300 dollars per hour, if they pay for it in advance.
And this will allow them to use these hours for these types of meetings. If they go over 200 hours, we&#39;ll be charging at $300 per hour.
And if it&#39;s after hours or weekends, We&#39;ll see you again. It&#39;s going to be $400 per hour. And for those strategic meetings, I was going to put in maybe a 25 hours per year that they can prepay and we&#39;ll have those quarterly meetings and other items with them.
For the breakdown here, I put in 10% volume discount for Ross because they have 3,400 students. For the other ones, I did not include a volume discount.
Let me know your thoughts on this and once I get the final round of feedback, I&#39;m going to send this over to them so that they have this to discuss during their meeting.
The understanding is that what I&#39;m going to state in that email is this is the lowest price that we can go.
Without removing modules. If they want to go further than this we would have to think about which of these modules they don&#39;t want to use.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/aa0bef5e780c4c35b3622f991f737221</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 30 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Agent. So here&#39;s a quick demonstration of how the open evaluations work. I&#39;m going to delete these two, three of them that are in my queue and right now I have no evaluations that I have to complete.
If I go to the open evaluation form and initiate a new evaluation, I&#39;m taken to the page where I can select a trainee and start the form.
If you scan a QR code, you are ending up on this page and as soon as this page opens, you have a evaluation.
So, regardless of whether you complete it or you leave the page, you have a task that&#39;s assigned to you and it&#39;ll be in your queue until you either complete it or come back and delete it.
So, if I go back in here and initiate another form. Essentially, every time I click that button, it&#39;s the same as scanning a QR code.
I will see another task that&#39;s assigned to me. So, each time they&#39;re scanning a QR code, they&#39;ll have a new form in their queue and each time we send out an email notifications to them.
It&#39;ll list out all the evaluations that are pending. As for the due date, let me get back to you on that one.
I believe there is a due date for the request evaluation. I&#39;m not sure if we automatically assign a due date to an open form since this is many, to be an ad hoc form that they initiated and want to complete at their own time.
But I&#39;ll see if there&#39;s anything that we do on the back end to capture a due date.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/366d4944821546998a490e342c2f1167</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Request Evaluation + QR Code</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Jin. I wanted to walk you through how to set up this form for those scenarios that you described. The first one was allowing the resident and the student, resident and the attending to meet and let the attending complete an evaluation using a QR code.
Second was allowing the resident to assign an evaluation to the attending and let them complete that at real time or later on when they have, when they have more time to finish.
So for that, I&#39;ve looked at your intern evaluation form and if we go to the assignment rules section and we come down.
To know you have already set this up to be something that&#39;s not automatically assigned should evaluate TSP allowed to request an evaluation.
You can set this to yes and I don&#39;t think you need to send out reminders to the trainees. So if that&#39;s enabled, it would send them an email a few days before the end of the rotation reminding them to put in a request to one of the attendings.
So you can turn that off and then the next one. Next one is should this form be made available as an open evaluation and that&#39;s already enabled.
So this functionality here allows the system to generate a QR code and then the number five here allows the resident to have a little widget on their dashboard so they can submit a request.
So I&#39;m going to save this and then we&#39;re going to take a look at what that looks like from the evidence side.
So I see you. That was intern. So PGY1. And I&#39;m using a copy of your backup. This is not your actual server.
So I&#39;ve logged in as one of the interns. And then on the right side, we have the request evaluation functionality.
From here, I can choose my ICU attending form. And then choose, well, it looks like we don&#39;t have a rotation in here.
Before I submit, I&#39;m going to go back and review where that&#39;s the case. Okay, I&#39;m going to change one of these.
Rotations to ICU. Again, this is not your actual server. Let&#39;s try that again. It&#39;s not giving me a schedule. So let&#39;s troubleshoot the template.
Okay, so it&#39;s only including ICU, A, B, and C. So I&#39;m going to go to the schedule. So make sure that he&#39;s scheduled to ICU, A, B, or C because when I last scheduled that I chose ICU, I&#39;m going to choose ICU. A, perfect, go back in.
Okay, now let&#39;s give me the ICU rotation. So you have to have someone scheduled to an ICU rotation or they won&#39;t be able to choose a rotation.
They can still submit the evaluation to an attending. Ideally, it should include, the rotation so you have context. Then I could submit that.
And now it has been sent to an attending. Again, this is not the real server so it&#39;s not going to send out any real emails as I&#39;m testing this.
So let&#39;s say if I want to send this to Okay, it&#39;s not, so we&#39;ll choose Aaron. Because the program director is not included on the template.
So I&#39;m going to choose Aaron, Smith, duplicate assignment, and then I can also go to the view evaluation assignments page, and I can see what was already submitted.
Right now, it, I assigned the same evaluation twice in real life. They&#39;re not going to do that and there&#39;s actually going to be a check that&#39;s added to prevent that to avoid mistakes.
But let&#39;s see what Aaron sees. So I&#39;m going to check out Aaron&#39;s account. I&#39;m using a special version of metrics that allows me to preview different accounts.
You won&#39;t be able to do this on your end. You&#39;re going to have to create an account to test this out.
But you can see, as soon as I sent that request, it will e-mail it will send out an e-mail to Aaron and he will have two assignments assigned to them.
And from here, I can complete that form. So that&#39;s the first process. Essentially, we are creating a template. We have rotations on it and we have enabled the ability to request an evaluation and then we make sure that resident has that rotation scheduled and then it&#39;s up to the resident to submit that
request from their dashboard. The second process is using the QR code. So if I go back and click the QR code button, this will give me this QR code and a QR code is essentially a image that represents some text.
So all it&#39;s doing is embedding this URL right here. So if anyone in the system scans this QR code, it will try to take them to this URL and if their role and access matches what&#39;s on the template, they will be allowed to complete that form.
So if I click on this, it tells me that I cannot do this because I don&#39;t have the permission to complete this evaluation.
So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to copy this See you next time. And go back and use Aaron&#39;s account.
And now if I scan the URL all. Or scan the QR code, it&#39;ll take me to this page where I can actually select a resident, select a rotation, and complete the form.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f38ac6a52f6d479fb116d53dea1ec6b0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video, we&#39;re going to review all of the different functionality that we have on Forms Part 2 so that we could make sure we retain that as we update it to view.
So first thing, on the Forms Part 2, we have several buttons at the top. When we upgrade this, we don&#39;t need to have the new narrative EPA question.
We can just simply create this as the new question and then we can switch into the competency and keep it simple.
Is I&#39;m going to start at the top here import question. This allows us to import questions from the question bank.
We want to make sure we have the ability to add these questions one by one. We have the ability to search as you type.
We also have filters on the search bar. So if I want to filter by different question type, I can do that.
I can also filter by different category. The other thing to note here is that on the import question page. By default, we show the non-system generated and active questions.
We want to keep it that way. We don&#39;t want to show any Thank you for watching. inactive questions by default.
So that&#39;s the import question. The next button we have is the import. Competency. We want to make sure that we have the ability to import competencies and this model is simple and it lists out all the system generated questions and we have the ability to add them one by one or we can add them.
The entire category all at once by clicking the add add all button. Then, for creating new questions, if I click the new question, I have the ability to create competency questions which includes the question, the description, and then for each question, I should be able to create, actually, for the
new question creation modal, we can use the modal that we have already implemented on the question bank. So essentially use this same modal and it&#39;ll include all the features that we need.
Then we have on the page itself, the ability to preview at the top. The edit and preview tab allows us to toggle between edit and preview.
We have a way to add a custom title. The title displayed in orange there. We also have the ability to move quickly.
We have questions up and down using this field here where I can put a value in there and quick move and I&#39;ll rearrange the questions.
We have the ability to preview. Each of the questions. So we have question types, competency, Likert, multiple choice, text questions, numeric, checklist, date, document upload.
For each of these we can preview it on the page. Under each question we also can see options to allow no feedback, not applicable.
We also show which questions are shared questions. We can see which questions have subcompetency. Any other competency mappings. We can have a drop-down button to select which options we can send notifications on.
We have a drop-down to click which options. We have a drop-down to click which options we can send required comments on or require comments on.
We have an edit button, a remove question from form button. Then all the way at the top we also have a turn on no feedback not applicable for all questions.
And that turn on no requirements for all question answers button. When we turn on these alerts we also have little icons that appear if any comments are required.
At an option we show a little comment icon. So those are all the functionality that we have on this page that we want to keep when we update it to view.
We also want to make sure that this page is saving as we modify it. It&#39;s autosafe and you can click save and continue.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4b27b440fafd4869aa25815fa1c14b20</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, Chelsea. So for this request of the hierarchy of the curriculum, I wanted to give you a quick demo of what the curriculum module looks like.
So in the curriculum module we have the, there&#39;s a sort of objectives. That can be mapped. And then there&#39;s key words and themes and learning methods that can be mapped.
So I&#39;m going to first go through the hierarchy of the objectives. So at the highest level, we have the global objectives.
These are meant to be your national standards or international standards that you&#39;re aligning with. So vet schools often align with the AVMA standards.
For medical schools, like in this demo environment, we have the American Association of Medical Colleges, physician competency reference set. So you, you can pick and choose which standard you want to use and we will import that and you have that in the system.
Next level down is the program objectives and here we are adding the school&#39;s objectives, institutional objectives. So when you have a vet school provide us with those objectives, we will turn those into mappable objectives under program objectives and then you can use that to standardize and map with
the global objectives. So for example on the left side we have global objectives, right side we have program objectives and I can use this to map it.
Next level down we have each of the courses and click clinical rotations that are offered. For those we also have a set of objectives.
So every course will have its own set of objectives, every rotation will have its own set of objectives and we can map those course objectives to those program objectives.
So this is a slightly different mapping interface that we use and we can use little check boxes to align the course objectives with those program objectives.
The most granular of these is the session objectives. We can add all the sessions and then for every session have a way to create objectives.
This is something that faculty can do themselves and you can give them the permission to create and map it. Mapping works very similar.
You load up the session objectives, program objectives, and you map that to the session objectives and course objectives, and you map those together.
Once all of this is mapped, you have a way to search across the curriculum and see the hierarchy for each of the objectives that are part of the curriculum.
Next, if we go back to sessions, we also have keywords that can be added. So, a standardized set of keywords can be added to the system and a standardized set of themes can be added to the system.
Then, every lecture, lab, small group session can be tagged with those keywords or themes. This allows mapping across multiple courses.
The objectives are top-down hierarchy while the keywords and themes are, as are, slices through the curriculum with multiple courses. And when it comes to searching, we can also do search using keyword.
We&#39;ll see you next time. So let&#39;s search for anatomy. One of the things you can see here is this demo environment.
You have duplicates. When we standardize the data for a new client, we often will lock it down. So that it doesn&#39;t have, everybody cannot create keywords and is standardized by the institution.
So you prevent these duplicates from happening. So you can bring up a search result and then click on it to see all the details of that session.
One of the things that we have also added that is not officially released is AI powered mapping. A big challenge for medical school and vet school deans is it&#39;s very tedious to map all the session objectives to the course objectives.
And many schools struggle getting the faculty to do this in a timely manner. So we&#39;ve added this functionality that allows institutions to automatically map session objectives to course objectives.
And this is something that you can click a button, it&#39;ll give you recommendations. And when those recommendations are reviewed by the faculty, they can either approve it or deny it.
If they&#39;re approved, then it gets saved. If it gets denied, then it gets cleared out. So this is something that is going to be released next month.
We&#39;re presenting it at a conference. And after that, it&#39;s going to be available to all of our clients. So it&#39;s going to be included as part of the curriculum module when it&#39;s released.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ec10a4f0b41c41d8b4a89ca00e1fc7c0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys.

So these are the additional information is supposed to show all the custom demographic fields. And they can then turn on whatever they want and include that.
I&#39;m not sure what is showing here. I think this may be case demographics. It looks like it. So we&#39;re not, we&#39;re not, we don&#39;t want to show the case demographics.
You want the user custom demographics when we click on that. And for all of these fields that are drop radio buttons, it would be nice if there&#39;s a select all button so that they don&#39;t have to click so many times they want to include.
Multiple options. And then for the include the following data, if you update that, it would be nice if we can preview that at the bottom.

So this is the spreadsheet that we went over during the call, and I wanted to summarize the modules that each of the schools are using.
So it has three tabs here, and each sheet shows a different school. So the first one here is Ross University, and here we can see that Ross Med is using the user&#39;s module which allows you to define all the trainees, preceptors, faculty members, and create different groups for scheduling.
The calendar module kind of brings all the schedules together and create a unified view for viewing those events. The curriculum module allows you to map out all four years of the curriculum, and we&#39;re also releasing this AI assistant functionality which will be included as part of the subscription when
it&#39;s released. This is for the preclinical session schedules as well as for the clinical rotation based schedules. Diagnosis and procedure logging for the clinical students as part of their rotations they can complete the required cases.
Site management for defining all the affiliate hospitals. Their leadership and defining permission based on those site administrators. The evaluations and competency management is for all four years.
The great book is for entering the course and rotation grades and also with the comments with the preceptors that&#39;s used on the MSPE letter.
And then obviously the MSPE charts and letter automation. The Outbound module is one module that&#39;s specifically built for Ross Med.
It allows the school to define different email notifications that are triggered when certain criteria are met such as like escalating incomplete evaluations.
And then down here we have the data warehousing for RosMed. And a couple other things to mention here is we do have one staging server that&#39;s available for all the institutions.
If we need additional staging servers for certain integration projects that&#39;s the additional cost. And then for RosVet, all of the modules here are the same with the exception of MSPE here.
We can remove that. But the RosVet does include Bye!</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/729a820971bb454b9b2f8f44a7b1dc64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma - 24 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Ericsson. So a few minor points here. This looks awesome. The font size between these body text on the front page, eliminate spreadsheets, and the questions here let&#39;s use the same size and also make sure the font itself is same across the board.
And for these button text, it would also be make sure that we&#39;re using the same font size. It&#39;ll create more consistency.
And for line spacing or spacing between lines, there&#39;s the text here. You have slightly different space here versus this based on here between get back to what matters.
So make sure that we&#39;re using equals. Spacing and then for this practice medicine, not software, the gray, let&#39;s use the same gray that we&#39;re using for the font here, which is hex code three, three, three, three, three.
And the last thing is I like the look with less curves. Let&#39;s adjust the curve on these orange so that the radius is the same for all three.
So you have one here. And if we adjust this one here to match the ones on the back so that it&#39;s consistent across the board.
And that&#39;s everything I have. Great work.

So this spreadsheet that I had included with the initial email had three tabs on here that summarizes the different modules that the schools are using.
I can go over each of them so that it&#39;s clear what these modules are doing. So for the learner and educator management, this is the user&#39;s module so each of the schools can define the roles, profiles and create groups for scheduling.
The calendar sort of brings everything together and provides a unified calendar for all the schedules that are created. This is going to be for mapping out the four years of curriculum and this AI Assist functionality is something that we&#39;re releasing soon and it&#39;s going to be available to the schools
as part of the curriculum subscription. The schedules is for all four years, the preclinical and clinical schedules, case logging, for diagnosis and procedure logs.
We have the site management which allows you to define different sites and also assign different permissions based on those sites.
The evaluations and competency management which is for all four years of the evaluations 360 different evaluations of the students as well as the courses and the rotations.
Gradebook and this is something that is used for the MSPE modules as well as to deliver a unified view for the students to see their grades.
There is an academic progress dashboard which is in there. I&#39;m not sure if the schools are using it yet but it&#39;s part of the gradebook module.
And then MSPE automation and chart generation. The outbound module is something that is used by Ross. It was custom built based on Ross&#39;s request and allows you to build email notifications based on business rules and escalate things to different individuals when something is not done.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5460d0fab05c4b6995d41158c9124cad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU - Google Docs - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mitch. These are the questions that you had asked in those emails. So the first thing is what do you have to instruct?
What do we have? What do we instruct the students to do when entering their preferences into the lottery? I&#39;m assuming this is in relation to the SPE place holder and other things that you&#39;ll be scheduling before optimization.
If so, the students will see those rotations already assigned when they&#39;re making the the ranking list. Again, I believe this was a functionality that we added recently after our discussions.
I will confirm that by Monday and and it&#39;s just the students will be able to see it and they don&#39;t have to add anything for those blocks.
As for the pre-scheduling, yes, you can go in and make those schedules now. In order to do that, you have to make sure those rotations exist in metrics.
So you just first add the sites. This will be under the institutional portal. Sites page, create those sites, then on the admin portal under system setup, rotations, you can create the rotations that belong with those sites.
After the both of those records are created, you want to go to the schedules page and add that block schedule for next year.
If it doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s essentially creating a new block schedule with a block structure. Then those assignments can be made for the students.
You also mentioned that the CV, CY 2024, 25 block schedule. Contains CVM3 students. So what happens to the schedule when we promote these students&#39; CVM4 role at the end of the year?
So once they get promoted, those scheduled assignments will still be there. We have a setting that you enable on any historical records so that you can see CVM3 students that have an assignment.
And as long as they had an assignment, they&#39;ll still show up on the schedule. And the second part here is what I reviewed earlier.
You would create the site. You would create the rotation. And then under the block schedule, you have a new block schedule for next year and you can start making those assignments.
And we&#39;ll review any additional questions that you have and go through this in more detail on Monday.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4a458601909643df9584240e6df7a360</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[SHARED] 2023 - LMU Optimization Process - Google Docs - 23 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Kwemi. I had a meeting with the dean today and we went over this constraint here and I wanted to update you on something that he clarified.
There&#39;s actually three elective forces. There&#39;s CVM 78780, 770E, 771E. So when we fill in those electives, we can pull from any one of these three to assign seven blocks.
If there are no pre-filled blocks, six. If there are no pre-filled, if there&#39;s one pre-filled block or five five assignments, if there&#39;s two pre-filled blocks.
The caveat here is that the CVM 770 is another course and then, so CVM 770 is the mandatory version and CVM 770E is the elective version that would be at the same site.
Same thing for CVM 770 and C770E. Basically, these sites offer two courses, the mandatory version and elective version. If there are two students that need to be scheduled and one of them requires a, let&#39;s say there&#39;s two students that need, one requires 770 and another requires an elective version.
If there&#39;s a site that has availability with both 770 and 770E, the student that requires the 770 would get the preference.
We always want to give the preference to the student that still needs to be scheduled. And I think that was something that we&#39;ll be adding later. Um, but I wanted to create this video and just make sure that I communicate this. Initially, I thought it was only 780, but it&#39;s actually three courses that
we can pull from.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/974a75b96b924de68e93cfa9998de0d7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Stand Up - Sheets - Jira - 24 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning Alejandro.

You&#39;re just raining outside? Oh yeah, my daughter had soccer moves in the rain all We&#39;ll see you next week. Okay, so you had to be out there.
Yup, that&#39;s good. It&#39;s good to actually my son, he loves going out in the rain. So even though he doesn&#39;t have any soccer yet, he, as soon as he rains, he wants to put his boots on him and plane the yard, which means I&#39;m out there.
Thanks for watching! I&#39;m used to, I&#39;m used to, he&#39;s a year and a half so I can&#39;t just let him out and say come back, come back when you&#39;re done.
We I was, we were in Phoenix this weekend. My wife had a conference last week. So I was the the babysitter slash dad who&#39;s my wife gets really upset when I say I was babysitting.
So you&#39;re not babysitting, you&#39;re being a dad. Yeah, it&#39;s not, you know, but it was really nice because I took the two days off and then we, Thursday and Friday, it was just me.
And my son the whole time with the, so we went to the Philly&#39;s game out in Phoenix. He was clapping with the Diamondbacks fans because we sat with the Diamondbacks fans the whole time and every time they clapped he clapped and and, and then they didn&#39;t score for like six innings and then finally they
scored and everybody went crazy and he got scared and started crying. And the guy behind me was like, don&#39;t cry, don&#39;t cry little buddy.
We&#39;re, we&#39;re just very happy. And then he looked at me and it&#39;s like, I think your son&#39;s a Philly fan.

I wanted to answer these questions that you had on here. What do we have to instruct the students?
I&#39;m assuming this is for the pre-scheduled rotations. So if you&#39;re putting someone into SPE and they&#39;re putting it on their schedules, what the students need to know.
I&#39;ll confirm this with before Monday, but I believe we added that capability for students to see anything that is pre-scheduled.
So when they go to the schedules page or the lottery page, they&#39;ll see anything that was already assigned and they don&#39;t have to add anything.
Well, they know that it&#39;s already assigned for that block and they don&#39;t have to add anything. Any additional requests for that block.
For the second question here, can we go ahead and enter those now? Yes, you can create those block schedules now.
In order to do that, simply have to go to the block schedule and create a new schedule and then you can make assignments.
If it&#39;s an SPE that&#39;s not in the system, you have to create the sites first, then add the rotations for those sites, then you can make the assignment.
To add the sites, you would go to the institutional portal sites page and add new sites either as an import or manually creating it.
Than for the rotary. For rotation, it would be under system setup, rotations on the program admin portal. The last piece of that would be under the block schedule.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7a8394149f574668a754fcd2d91fcc24</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU - Google Docs - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mitch.

Because I believe we had gone over in a call and thought they were changing that rule, but we could talk more about it on Monday.
As for the other items students. I would have to check to see. Yeah, so if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, 770 versus 770E, it is automatically going to work like this because the mandatory courses will always get priority over the elective courses.
I want to make sure we can talk more on Monday and make sure that we have that correct. So, down here you had a couple of questions for entering the seven confirmed slides.
171 to the schedules for optimization ahead of optimization. That&#39;s correct. We will have a SPE placeholder and n-a-v-l-e prep is going to be manually scheduled and</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/162cd4edd54543b2931b62417acc5b2c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU - Google Docs - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mitch. So for these questions I wanted to send you this video and then we can go into more detail on Monday.
So the first one here, what do we have to instruct the students about entering the press preferences into the lottery tool?
I believe, oh, if I understand this correctly, if it&#39;s already pre-scheduled, then it will show up on their view so that they don&#39;t have to do anything and it will show up as something that&#39;s already pre-scheduled.
I will confirm that for Monday and then the second question here is for those pre-scheduled rotations, you would treat that like your normal block schedule that you did for this year.
You would have to first add the site under the institutional portal, then go to the system set up into the program portal and create the rotation and the rotation, when you create the rotation, you can select that new site that you added.
Once the site and the rotation are added, go to the block schedule and schedule the student for that time, which I believe you&#39;re already doing.
Outlining here in the second email, build the site, build the rotation, and then it would be going into that block schedule and scheduling them.
The second question that you had on here was when you promote those CVM three students to CVM. Before, we do have a script that we run so that all of the historical schedules will maintain those students on there.
So you&#39;re not going to lose them from the schedule. This way, as long as they as long as they have an assignment on that schedule, they will show up.
And this is something that we can do, and I believe you could do on your end too, when you edit the schedule.
There&#39;s a check box at the bottom for saying that this is a historical schedule. But, I wouldn&#39;t do that yet.
We can work through that later. But it will still preserve those schedules in the system so that when their role changes, they will be showing up in the new schedule, but the historical data will still be preserved.
And I&#39;ll explain that in more detail on Monday when we meet. But for now, if we want to start creating those schedules, the first thing is add the site, then add the system, set up rotations, add the rotation, and then this will allow those rotations to show up on the schedule, and then the students
can get that schedule assigned to them.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b6f1535721cd47249a071556efda0357</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU Programs in Medtrics - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Brandon. I hope you&#39;re doing well. I wanted to create a short video explaining the the pricing for Chamberlain.
This document which I&#39;m sending with this email was put together in 2022 to show how the Chamberlain pricing would be structured.
At that time, we discussed with, well, I discussed with Keona that the Chamberlain programs would have a total of 9,000 students and we negotiated a volume discount based on that 9,000.
Once we had established the discounted rate, we learned from Chamberlain that there is no set schedule for when these programs would switch over to metrics.
And typically, with every other contract we have done, if there&#39;s a volume discount, the volume discount is applied. When all the licenses are being activated, essentially the school is saying, I&#39;m buying all these licenses now and we would add that volume discount.
We have never done this in a staggered implementation. But as a courtesy for Talaam, we provided the discounted rate of $40 per trainee.
For Chamberlain and allowed the programs to start when they&#39;re available. So we started with AGNP with a hundred trainees, then PMH with another 300 trainees.
And then last year we started onboarding for FNP, DNP, but the FNP, DNP program at the last minute, what&#39;s pushed into 2020.
23. So Chamberlain adjusted the SOW to state that we would get, collect the payment for it in 2022, but the licenses would start in 2023.
At that time, we also adjusted the SOW to be more specific with the largest cohort and document that those, students will be activated by the end of 2023.
So we&#39;re now at the end of 2023 and we still don&#39;t have those students activated and we&#39;re learning that it will be pushed into next year.
So that&#39;s becomes a big challenge for us because that&#39;s the largest cohort in this volume discount. So our proposal is that we are okay with keeping the volume discount as it is.
We would like to see that BSN have a set date for Go Live and be able to capture that payment before the end of this year for this fiscal year.
So BSN program or the Chamberlain Group will be benefiting from only activating the licenses when they are ready to go live and they&#39;re not paying for any unused time.
Metrics will be able to capture that payment in this fiscal year and then also start the custom development that is required for that BSN go live.
So that&#39;s our request here. If we cannot do that then the other option is for us to come up with an adjusted volume rate for 2500 trainees because that&#39;s the only that&#39;s the total we have right now in this system.
And it&#39;s been almost two years now where we&#39;ve been granting the reduced price without having that large cohort in metrics.
So let me know what questions you have and I&#39;m more than happy to go into more detail when we meet on Tuesday.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0fd9b640399a41a3a963d9f5e00289a4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU Programs in Medtrics - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Brandon. I wanted to create this video summarizing this pricing document that I shared with Keona last year when we were coming up with the rates for Chamberlain.
At that time, Keona and I worked together to review the student count and come up with rates that include a volume discount for 9,000 students.
So my understanding at the time was that we would have a pretty quick onboarding for these students, similar to the way that we did with the Met Vet program.
Unfortunately afterwards, we learned that Chamberlain is not like the medical schools. And that it would have to be staggered over a period of time.
So as a courtesy, Metrix agreed to provide the volume discount, even though we didn&#39;t have the volume. And the AGNP started first, then PMH started, and that was a total of about 400 students.
And then this year, the FNP and DNP started, and that brought the total count to around 2,500. And when the FNP program started, we had a conversation with the team at Atalum, and we adjusted the SOW to be more more specific.
On when BSN would start, and the SOW now states that BSN program would start by the end of 2023, or we would adjust the volume rates to account for the actual volume, which is about 2,500 right now.
And that&#39;s the, the issue that we have to resolve, because if BSN is getting pushed into next year, then we don&#39;t have the volume for the 9,000 students.
So the proposal that I shared in the email was similar to the way that FNP was paid at the end of 2023.
To, but when live in 2023, we can do the same thing with BSN where the payment is processed in 2023, but the student licenses are activated in July of 2024.
So that way Chamberlain is still benefiting from only paying for the licenses when they&#39;re activated. We&#39;re able to capture that revenue this year and also get started on some of the custom development that Chamberlain needs.
And this would also allow us to keep the volume discount in place. You know, we need that volume to justify the discount because otherwise we were operate like, you know, we&#39;re operating and providing support for all these programs that are already live with a significant discount on that subscription
rate. And this timeline here shows what we initially proposed, which was in 2022 we would have all of the students activated.
But now it&#39;s the 2023 and we still don&#39;t have a the licenses activated for BSN. Until next time, have a</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f6eaa41ec3f54fa7af91bad94087ff87</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Asya and Demo. I wanted to create this short video to include with this proposal and go into some more details.
So this was a proposal that was created based on our discussion. And it includes a summary of some of our other offerings too.
So for example, this page outlines the different modules that we offer, as well as the different services such as live chat support.
Thank you. And then a few of them that I want to emphasize here is it is a live chat. For example, all of the.
The administrators are using the system will have a chat window at the bottom right and you can open up from any page and send us questions as you&#39;re using the system.
This is something that is useful after you finish onboarding. And I&#39;ll be going into the onboarding process in the next doc in one of the few, one of the pages later.
But once onboarding is done, live chat is one of the common ways that clients get help from us. There&#39;s also training that&#39;s provided during onboarding, and then we also provide additional training as needed throughout the year.
So if someone is starting in your organization that&#39;s new, we can create a. A zoom call and set up a training session for them as needed.
Metrics also includes a knowledge base that includes several videos and articles for each of the modules. There&#39;s also continuous updates for all the modules.
So throughout the year almost every month we have updates that are going out. Then we have webinars that explain what those features were.
In terms of our support that&#39;s included, 8am to 8pm, we have phone, email, and live chat. So most of our clients are reaching out to us through the live chat because it&#39;s a quick way to reach us without having to open up your inbox or submit a ticket.
And then when we respond, if you&#39;re not logged into the system, it&#39;ll email you back. And we also have a back.
Backups of all, all of your systems so that if something goes down, we&#39;re able to restore it pretty quickly. And backups are taken every eight hours.
This is the onboarding and I&#39;ll get to that in a second. So all of the onboarding that we do is broken up into projects.
So typically we do one project for a curriculum, one project for preclinical, one project. Another one for MSPE. It all depends on what the institution is setting up.
We will start likely with the curriculum module. And that&#39;s about three months. And those three months in, includes us meeting with you every week for 30 minutes where we define different processes and migrate your data and also configure different settings in metrics.
And the most important, one piece of that is the process development. We&#39;re working with you during that time to look at your current curriculum and define new processes for the new platform.
It&#39;s done. You test everything out and then we train additional faculty members and go live. So that&#39;s the standard onboarding process.
If we do that for a clinical or preclinical, we&#39;ll have a different team on your end that&#39;s meeting with us.
That&#39;ll go through a similar process of configuring the system for their processes. These are the different modules that we have included and it&#39;s not everything in the system.
It&#39;s ones that you had requested. And this has a slightly different names on here. There&#39;s a learner and educator management.
That&#39;s the training portfolios. There&#39;s a learner in attendance. Clinical schedules include pre and the preclinical schedules. So the schedules includes both.
And the site management is managing for all your affiliate hospitals and when you&#39;re sending students there you can track all the institutions and their contact there.
For site management it also includes expiration tracking for any affiliate hospitals if you need to track that. The evaluations and competency management, that, is for all four years that allows you to build out forms and deliver them automatically based on your schedule, then also track different competencies
. So this pricing is for 844 students. And then for the curriculum, it&#39;s a mod, we call the standalone module because it is something that institutions can purchase without student access.
You can, you use it to map out all forms. Four years of your training and the, the module will also include an AI powered assistant.
After next month, we&#39;re releasing it at the AMC conference. Allow you to do curriculum mapping from session level objectives to the course level objectives you are using AI.
I think I may have shown this during the demo. If not, it&#39;s meant to give faculty a way to click a button.
It will show the mapping that the AI is recommending and then you can approve it if you agree with the mappings that the AI did.
Or you can do it manually. And in terms of presentation, we put this in here for one project and we&#39;re planning that for the curriculum project.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ea4c480cf2fa4ac7aa956ff7c4ecc4aa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) My first business went bust at 24. - 3 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So even though this has test emails and websites on mobile, this gave me an idea for a post. One of the things that I read a few years ago when I was writing a lot of sales emails is how it&#39;s best to keep emails to about five sentences or keep it as short as possible.
But the five sentence email is something that&#39;s been promoted in a, in a way to keep everything very concise so that when someone is looking at it it&#39;s actually from a guy Kawasaki who&#39;s one of the, the evangelists for Apple.
And essentially, who are you? What do you want? Why are you asking me? Why should I do what you&#39;re asking?
What&#39;s the next step? So this is a, a good post for my LinkedIn because a lot of physicians and healthcare leaders, they write emails, but they&#39;re not they write very long verbose emails.
And when you&#39;re emailing someone, you know, an authority figure, like a CEO or hospital director. They don&#39;t have a lot of time.
And if you write an email in a very concise way and get right to the point, they&#39;re more likely to respond to you.
And the other thing is a lot of people use this their email on their phones and if those emails are very short and concise, you&#39;re more likely to get a response than if they&#39;re keep scrolling and trying to figure out your what you&#39;re saying.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/09162f7ff5b64225a1acb590beed0ca7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Add Rotation To Templates – Figma - 3 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this is a feature that I already started designing that you can pick up essentially when When we are creating a rotation When we&#39;re creating a rotation on the system setup And I&#39;ll see you next time.
Bye-bye. Rotations page and I click add rotation. We can create a rotation anytime. But one of the things that the faculty members or administrators have to do is after the rotation is created, they have to go to the templates page and add that newly created template rotation onto a template.
So sometimes they can forget to do this, which means you&#39;re stuck with a rotation that&#39;s not getting assigned evaluations. To fix that, we&#39;re going to add this functionality.
So at the bottom of this page, we&#39;re going to add a section that&#39;s called add rotation to evaluation templates. And this will list out all of the rotation based evaluation templates.
Remember when we create an evaluation template, we have different form types. We&#39;re only going to show the ones that are active.
And form type is rotation. And then when I create this rotation, I can check off the ones that I want to link this to.
It will also have, when you come back to edit, it will show all the rotations that all the templates that this rotation is linked to.
So any existing forms, we will show them as linked to the forms. So if I go in here and I open up this let&#39;s say urgent care rotation at the mod at the bottom of this existing rotation, I will see all the templates that are active.
That a rotation type and anything that this urgent care rotation is added to, it&#39;ll have a checkbox turned on. So so I think the only thing that we need to do.
To essentially write this up and for this I have added this as a link. So if I click on the link, it should open up in a new tab and go to the Evaluations Assignment Rules page so that that way they can tweak any addition.
And then when they save, we want to show a sweet alert that says, please confirm that you want to have this rotation added to the following evaluation templates and they can confirm that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0ecef17ca84444ea8eaf53e6b3303610</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Proposal - University of Kansas</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Azia and Emma. I hope you&#39;re having a good day. I wanted to send you this video to go over the proposal this way to clarify some things and then and Provide some more context on how we put it together So this proposal was includes the modules that you requested based on our discussion
but also give you some more details on how we onboard and support our clients. Second page shows the different modules that we offer.
We haven&#39;t included all of them in this proposal and we also have some of the services that we offer such as live chat support, on-site training if needed, data migration, customer success, and out of those, I want to highlight a couple of things here.
The live chat support. This is something that is commonly used by our clients to reach us when they have any questions.
You know, so we have about a few months of onboarding that we go through where we&#39;re talking regularly on a weekly basis.
But afterwards, once it is onboarded and implemented, live chat is something that is available on each of the pages on metrics.
You can simply click on it and send us a message. And if we respond and you&#39;re not logged into the system, it will get sent you an email.
So that is one of the common ways that clients reach us. For training, this is also included as part of the onboarding process.
However, afterwards, if you need additional training, we&#39;re able to accommodate that using Zoom meetings and there&#39;s no additional cost for that.
So if you have a new staff member that&#39;s starting, you can go ahead and schedule the meeting and in our calendar with the, with our support team and we&#39;ll put, provide more training.
Metrix also has a built-in knowledge base that is now AI powered. So when you have questions, you can ask the, the chat interface and Metrix will deliver answers from the knowledge base so that you know how to use different modules.
Metrix also includes continuous updates. This is one to twice a year. Twice per month. We roll out updates, tweaks to the system, bug fixes and then we also cover that during the weekly, the monthly webinars.
As for support, we&#39;re available 8am to 8pm Eastern time. And then you can reach us via phone and email, but also the live chat that I mentioned earlier.
Metrix is also backed up every 8 hours so that any data that you add to the system is not lost.
If there&#39;s some sort of server failure. I&#39;m going to skip this next page and I&#39;ll come back to that later.
So for our implementation slash onboarding, we typically break up things into projects and measurable objectives that we want to do. Accomplish and each project has three individuals working on it from our end.
One is a physician to is a technical lead. Another one is a project coordinator. So these three individuals will meet with your team on a weekly basis for 30 minutes.
And this will include a. An onboarding discussion about what are the things you want to accomplish and then process development.
So we spend a lot of time creating new processes so that when you are moving into a new platform, you&#39;re taking full advantage of it and not simply recreating something that was already in another platform.
So, this gets us a deep understanding of your system, your organization. And then make sure that by the end of those three months, you&#39;re ready to train your faculty and get started.
When it comes to the modules, we have included the curriculum, the evaluations the trainee profiles, faculty profiles, calendar, and schedules.
So this page shows the pricing for a year. This is the total pricing per year so the total pricing is for the first years this much and then after the first year is $5,000 less for each year.
For the learner and educator modules this is for managing all the profiles for the students, faculty and preceptors and then also be able to create different groups that are necessary for scheduling the calendar and attendance.
For viewing all the different curricular and extracurricular events on a unified calendar sync with external to metrics. It also gives that personalized appearance for the students where they can see what events they go into in different color coded views.
Clinical schedules and preclinical scheduling. Preclinical scheduling is closely tied with the curriculum module and allows you to deliver those lectures in labs and content that is in the curriculum to the students.
And the clinical schedules is our block-based scheduling where you can schedule them to a certain number of weeks. Site management is for managing all of your internal and external sites.
These are high-level. Hospitals that are, or clinics you&#39;re affiliated with. You can even add those affiliation agreements into metrics and track their exploration.
Evaluations and competency management is for all four years. Helps you manage all the evaluations that are assigned, including student evaluation, preceptor evaluation, faculty evaluation, course evaluation, rotation.
Evaluations, all of that is captured here. And then you can also have a unified set of competencies that is managed all throughout those four years.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2b41eefe90c344138d9c32a24064643b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So for the medical school program, we have an option to map a rotation to a gradebook rotation. And this is something that they do when they create the rotation.
And there&#39;s a section called map to gradebook. So if you&#39;re manually creating these, you can do that. But the problem is when we do a bulk import using the spreader, sheet, we don&#39;t have a column to map it to the gradebook rotation.
So what we want to do is update the spreadsheet that we have in here. So we add a column called gradebook rotation.
And in that column, we could enter the code. So you can see the code is here. It says IM or PBI 630.
And if the end, it&#39;s called, it&#39;s going to be a column called Gradebook Rotation Code. And if they enter the code, we will map that newly created rotation to that Gradebook Rotation.
So if I&#39;m importing, let&#39;s say, 50 rotations at the same time, at the start of a new client&#39;s onboarding, we&#39;re going to be able to create the rotation and map all 50 of them to the Gradebook Rotation.
So essentially adding a new column to the import. And then explaining that that import is going to be used to make the link from the rotation to the Gradebook Rotation using the code.
Also update the design here for the rotations page. Instead of saying curriculum, we can replace that with Gradebook Rotation and then it&#39;ll show the code of that Gradebook Rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1b1f452c82a04612b7cd06fefc7a548b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike we recently fixed a bunch of stiff stuff on this page and I think there may be more issues going on so I&#39;m gonna let you see if you can test this.
This is when you&#39;re creating a new template going to the questions page, click new question, and then if I Bye!
Let&#39;s say I create a question with these options and then I click edit. If I try to change it, go to preview, I go to multiple choice and I try to preview it, it&#39;s not showing multiple choice.
I go to numeric and it&#39;s still showing Likert questions. I go to competency, it&#39;s not showing competencies here. Preview is off.
So it looks like when you&#39;re editing a question, the preview is not working properly. And this bottom section is not getting updated properly.
So if I go to text works, but if I go here. It shows that if I go to competency, you should have changed your competency questions, but it&#39;s not changing anymore.
I also. Yeah, I think the best way to. To figure this out, it&#39;s to go to the questions page on the left side, and you create a new question and see how this page works.
The other page should work exactly like this. The design is slightly different because this was I&#39;ll be right back. It&#39;s not upgraded.
But what we need to do is look at this page and make sure the other one works like this. Like, if I create an option and then I switch to Likert, you can see, It appears differently in the preview.
Show up. Go to multiple choice. The preview will show up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4c6919fcd7f1409f92e0b243d43ebbb0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>This is meant to address a couple of bugs on this evaluations and templates pages. Is first, when we create a new evaluation template, for the, we wanna add these.
Descriptions, and right now, on the Kaisa server, we have, on the Kaisa server we have all the descriptions, we don&#39;t have that loaded anywhere else, we wanna make sure that it&#39;s updated.
And when we do update it, we want to make sure that the general form description is fixed, because right now it says, use this form, type to, when you are trying to collect feedback on an entire training.
That&#39;s actually a program eval type. So what we want to update that to, say, is use this form type when you want to survey the people.
Ah, period. The form type does not allow you to evaluate a person or, or situation, or situation, period. It&#39;s, it&#39;s meant to collect general feedback.
And only has, and does not have an evaluate t assigned. That&#39;s the first part. The second bug is, when we open up QR code and click on this.
It gives me an error. So right now it&#39;s probably giving me an error because I don&#39;t have the role of whatever role is enabled here to start that form which is fine.
What we want to do is instead of showing a 500 error give the user a sweet alert that says you do not have permissions to open this form.
You do not have permission to initiate this form and then say please contact your administrator to update the form assignment rules if you feel like this is meant that this is showing an error.
So that will give them the information to correct the mistake if they need to. That&#39;s the second item. The third item is this import template button that we added.
The import template button was added to the right side which is not the best place to put that because the rightmost action on a page is always meant to use for creating whatever record exists on that page so as we create action.
So we want to make sure that we move that to the left side because import is always on the left side.
So we can put that on the import template button over here and that&#39;ll make it obvious to the users. Otherwise you&#39;re always going to be clicking this by mistake and then getting confused.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e1d1add8245a4f488144a2dfe0fa66f7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CY2024-25 Rotations List - Smartsheet.com - 6 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so here we go. In this Google Drive folder, I have put all the files that are necessary for this project.
So to start with, these are the two documents, the LME Availability Final and Rotation List Final that they sent over that includes information about availability.
This has the relevant columns are going to be the site codes, site name, and all these available discussions. What this does not have is the course code.
So for us to get the course code, we have to use this document and match it based on the, the name of the site, I believe.
And this also contains the note whether it&#39;s mandatory or elective, which is not that important, but we have it here.
So we can combine these two documents to create the availability document, which has a site code, clinical site, subject, which is going to the course code site, a rotation name, which is also on here.
That&#39;s the full name here. That&#39;s called the rotation name. Then available slots, that&#39;s on the LME availability number of slots and each of these are going to be the blocks.
So once that, done, the next thing is the preferences. They have shared last year&#39;s preferences and this contains the rotation name the student&#39;s name.
We had to create a new column for student id. And the site name here has a list of all the sites but the thing is we don&#39;t know if any of these sites were removed for this year or any were added.
So one of the things that we have to do is check to see if all of these sites on are in the same in the availability document.
So essentially do a lookup and see if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s missing from the availability. If there&#39;s something missing from the availability we have to decide whether we want to keep that in the preferences and add more rows to the availability document or vice versa.
Remove it from the preferences and keep it consistent with the availability. So the first thing to do is just simply identify what&#39;s different.
I think adding additional rows to the availability is probably the best thing because we want the student document to be as accurate as possible.
On this document the weight here indicates the ranking. So on our preferences document we have student name which can be the concatenated first and last names, student ID if you had to make up, subject, site code, remember site code we&#39;re also making up, rank which is going to be the weight and then
the block. So for block we have this column, we simply want to replace it with the block number. We don&#39;t care about the error a and b which we can sacrifice and any, when it says any time frame we can simply remove that from the preferences.
The optimizer will automatically assume that they need to do those. Alright, so that&#39;s the everything. Let me know if you have any questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2b72416a96b04636b02e6f4937d54057</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Experience and Headline Section - 1 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Stephanie. So for this about section, I really like the flow of it. What I wanted to point out was when I started this company I wasn&#39;t really impacted that much by the evaluation system or at least That&#39;s it.
I wasn&#39;t really the primary problem that I was solving at the time. I was a medical student and I was working with a faculty member who.
Was very frustrated and I saw firsthand some of the challenges he was having some of the other faculty members. And the residents were having so they were walking around the hospital with paper evaluations and then having to go and drop it off somewhere and it was essentially a big waste of time.
In my opinion, this got the discussion started with my faculty and he encouraged me to start creating. Designing something and it was me observing this and getting encouraged by my faculty member that I kind of started this process.
I wasn&#39;t directly held back. Well, I&#39;m sure I was, but at least that wasn&#39;t the. Problem that I faced and I also don&#39;t want to really say that I was negatively impacted by medical, but my medical school because that&#39;s a potential client in the future.
And I have a Dean&#39;s and from my medical school that is part of my LinkedIn and this still applies. Yeah, and the rest of it, I think it still applies.
And I also wanted to share something I&#39;ve been putting, together. Essentially, I&#39;ve been trying to craft some marketing material, well, not necessarily marketing material, like setting a clear vision for the company and it&#39;s still a draft.
And I&#39;m iterating. Working on this myself and before I show it to the team and getting presented to them at the end of October.
So for example, the mission essentially kind of settled on a, we build technology for people shaping the future of healthcare.
At least for now, I&#39;m still, I&#39;m still trying to find the best way to work. This but it all, it all stems from the same message.
Mainly trying to say the, say it in a more concise way, but essentially as a company, I&#39;ve been trying to focus on the message of the people rather than the the software aspect of it, but at the center of it is the people and how we are helping those people shape the future of healthcare.
And also been drafting a guiding principles of metrics. And these are a few of the ones that I have outlined.
That I&#39;m going to be polishing up, but I figured I&#39;d share those with you also because my message through LinkedIn should also align with the, the company&#39;s guiding principle because these are all coming from me.
For example, embrace the infinite journey, make decisions that will impact healthcare. For a hundred years. You know, we don&#39;t want to play the short game.
We don&#39;t make decisions about the quarter or the the year. It&#39;s all about the long-term growth of the company. And as a company, we also want to be confident, but approachable.
So we want to make sure that we&#39;re respected by our clients, but it&#39;s not an, it&#39;s not a, a robotic authoritarian language that we use.
It&#39;s more of a approachable, friendly language. And then, like I said earlier, prioritize people and their stories over. Software stepping outside of the box, essentially take risks while also being true to our values, seek simplicity, transform complex solutions into clear solutions,
transform complexity into clear solutions. And then, pursue tomorrow, challenge challenge the status quo for a better future, take ownership, act with integrity, and always be learning.
So, it&#39;s going to be it. I&#39;m going to be continuing to iterate on this over the next couple weeks but I wanted to share this with you. Since some of the About Me messages on my LinkedIn page should align with this message.
Hopefully that makes sense.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f8ae12bfd7884870aa084bb4dcd9b067</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>berkshire medical center - Google Search - 29 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, I&#39;m going to go over Lincoln Memorial School of Veterinary Medicine, so College of Veterinary Medicine is one of the larger ones in the United States, and we are going to be hearing from Mitch, who&#39;s the Dean there, and he has a background in tech software.
Before he became a veterinarian, so he&#39;s a big fan of metrics. We talk to him regularly and I think he&#39;s going to be a great person to highlight.
And when we do the interview we can focus on a few key areas. They purchase metrics for their clinical years, clinical students, and the they switched over to us from a platform called e-value.
And it&#39;ll, without saying names, it&#39;ll be good to compare what the experience has been with metrics and what are some of the key differences that he&#39;s seeing in managing his training program.
And also what are some of the key differences in working with the metrics team. I actually received an email so funny I was just on the website and I saw her name here, Dean Stacey Anderson.
She&#39;s apparently the top dean above Mitch. And I got an email someone sent an email to Stacey Anderson. They thought you might find this metrics report useful at some point.
This is for the first four blocks. And Stacey Anderson, the top dean, was like, those case numbers are insane. Is it because metrics are insane? Is it so much easier for logging?
And then Mitch was like that&#39;s most likely it. And it&#39;s much easier to log cases in metrics than in e-value.
So this, this is a, you know, we can bring this up and talk more about the reaction that Stacey Anderson had about case logging, which is a big component of what vet schools do.
They go to different hospitals or animal hospitals and clinics. When they do a procedure on an animal, they will log it into the case book and then to keep track of all the different diagnosis that they have.
We&#39;re also doing, we built a whole module for them to help handle e-portfolios and that&#39;s something that we implemented with them.
Another key change that we did was when they were on the previous system, they only kept track of different sites and hospitals or different sites and clinics that students were going to.
These sites, they didn&#39;t track the specific experience they were having there in their platform. In Metrix, they&#39;re putting down what exactly they&#39;re doing there as part of a clinical experience.
So if they&#39;re going there to see small animal or large animal experience, they&#39;re putting that into Metrix as a rotation which is tied to a hospital.
So when they&#39;re scheduling, they&#39;re being more specific as to what they&#39;re being scheduled to instead of saying you&#39;re going to the hospital.
Act. And oh, the other thing that we did with LMU is we actually had a structured onboarding process where we had meetings weekly for three months and each week we implemented different parts of the system.
And we can, we, I wanna, this would be a great video for us to highlight our onboarding process and what it was like to meet with us weekly to review things and have their multiple team members on that meeting.
When they finished onboarding during their onboarding process, different things came up that allowed us to customize the experience for them and help them create new processes that they implemented.
When they one of the things that came up during the implementation was they wanted to track all this custom fields for their hospitals.
So we actually expanded our custom fields to support fields for hospitals. So now they can see a lot of granular information about where the students are going.
So that&#39;s, that&#39;s some of the highlights I can think of.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e515439675dc40809ce2174bd4b00508</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this is going to be a bug that we&#39;re going to address, a couple of bugs actually on this evaluation templates page.
So the first thing is when you select an open evaluation and you click QR code and you click. Let&#39;s go let&#39;s click on QR code.
I click on this, I get a 500 error. If I&#39;m logged in and, like, if I choose a general form type, and I make it an open eval, and then I try to preview it as a user.
So what we want to do is make sure that it doesn&#39;t show the 500 error, and that if the user should not see that form, we show a sweet alert that says you do not have the permission, you do not have permissions to see this form.
Period. Please contact your administrator to update the assignment rules if you feel that this is being shown in error. Period.
So that will give, and then they can click OK, and it&#39;ll take them. It&#39;ll close the suite alert. So this is something that will allow them to be aware of what&#39;s happening and not email support team when they cannot preview it.
The second bug is really usability issue. We recently added this import template button. On the right side, we want to move that to the left side because the rightmost button should always be for creating a new record for that page.
So for example, if you go to the user&#39;s page, the rightmost button is to create a new user. And then the import is on the left side.
So if we go to the case log templates page, this is where we create a new record. So we always want to be consistent with our UX design because people will build muscle memory and they&#39;ll always gonna click that right button without reading it.
So keep that consistently allow them to learn the system better.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2398b463507f43c8b1c7d478fafea33e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Proposal Ashmore Hospital - PandaDoc - 6 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ. So it&#39;s a video as I was going through it. One of the things, the names here is Ashford, Ashford Hospital.
The other thing that I noticed was that for here, we have 15 min hours of allocated time. Then we say 25 hours here.
It&#39;s, this is a template that we simply have to improve. I&#39;m just going to remove that there. So that doesn&#39;t say 15 hours here and then 25 hours there.
We typically do weekly meetings and then at the bottom we have three months of 15 hours. That&#39;s perfect. And then this is good.
And here we&#39;re listing out some of the modules. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary because it&#39;s not a complete list so you have a complete list up there.
And the one more thing that I believe they needed was iris. And this is going to be for residents. Since they&#39;re a GME, it&#39;s going to be residents and that&#39;s it.
And I usually kill this page and once It&#39;s all done. We can actually send it out directly from here. It would allow us to track who&#39;s seen it and all of that.
The only thing to keep in mind is that once we send it, we cannot make any edits because it&#39;ll ruin the link.
That&#39;s the only caveat. So if we find a typo or something, we cannot. If you fix it, you have to generate a new link so I think it&#39;s worth sending it from the system so we can see it, what it works like, and and then send it.
And then you can also follow up with a short email that includes the PDF.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/015bbf2b1cb74934be3acb3d3801f775</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (1405) - 2 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Marcus, thank you for pointing that out. I missed that email earlier, so I love the video and these are a couple of notes that I wanted to make.
One was, do we have any other images that we can replace? Some of these very Hollywood looking images. For example, these earlier images, they look very genuine and doctor-patient type photos.
Even this one is a little bit too Hollywood and I think it loses impact. When you have some of these glamorized photos.
If we have anything else that is more like these images, Like this one here I love. I think it&#39;ll keep it more consistent because some of these images, look like this one right here is very real looking as opposed to like this this one this one and I think this this one here goes three if
you have any other images that would be good especially this one like I&#39;m not a fan of this one at all and if we can do something where there&#39;s teaching or something since that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about here that&#39;ll be a better better image and then the the last section here this background
like this grayish background and this grayish background. It&#39;s rather than having these things in the background to make the text stand out.
It&#39;ll be better if we keep it more it will look more simple and cleaner. We can do that gradient. So here&#39;s what I mocked up in Figma.
Essentially, what I did was once the video comes on, we can overlay a linear gradient across the entire screen, so it&#39;s kind of fades it out to white, and you can still see the people and the smiling faces.
But the text will be more clear, and we also want to use the logo and the tagline without anything behind it.
And then the, I didn&#39;t add the boot at the bottom. We put AAMC 2023, oop 216, this is the hall.
This way they know this is not going to be shown in the exhibit hall so they know where to find us.
So let&#39;s, if we can do this it would be awesome that way it makes it, it makes it look a little cleaner.

This is on the MSU, but we can try it in other places too. The other issue here is that you can see this UI is messed up where the pagination is shown up on the right side.

So I went through the image and I really love the new look. It looks a lot cleaner. And a couple of smaller tweaks that I wanted to mention was, you have these text increase compliance outside of the browser.
Let&#39;s do the same with Unipod. You can identify your team and remove the browser and put that in the background here and then use a similar color scheme so it&#39;s matching what we have and the font also.
Like a match both and then put that on the top right. Another thing I&#39;m noticing is believe this the line height between these two tags is too close so if you take a look at website golden ratio and choose the font that we&#39;re working with and I put let&#39;s say 65 content with it&#39;ll give us Some ratios
like if you&#39;re using size for 65 what the line height should be and then you can adjust that So you want to have that type of typography have good ratios between them That&#39;s the only suggestion that I had.
Once we make these changes you can go ahead and update it in Webflow and replace the images that&#39;s on the home page and if you don&#39;t have access to it let me know.
I&#39;ll make sure that you have an invite to the administration side and then if you need help with using it, talk to Le.
He can give you a link. I&#39;ll give you pointers on how to edit the content on there. And again if you, if you get stuck, message me and I&#39;ll show you.

I wanted to review this process with you on this video. First thing that we want to do is go to the evaluations page.
This is a copy of your server. I&#39;m going to go ahead and create that custom milestones category. You don&#39;t have to do this part since I already did that on your server.
But once we have that, we go to the questions page on the questions tab on the questions page. And then we&#39;re going to choose the custom milestones category.
Right now it&#39;s empty. Then I&#39;m going to click the new narrative EPA button. Go to link sub competency and select the sub competency that I want to edit and click the plus button next to it.
Then I will go to the edit tab and click the import link option. Then I can choose the option to import the link.
This will now let me edit the text here. So I&#39;m going to say editing and by the way at the top where the question it doesn&#39;t show the phrase PC2.
So if you want to add that you can edit the question also and then click save. And now we have the edited version.
So we want to repeat that process for all of the. Narratives or the PAs that that you want to add it.
And once it&#39;s edited, we can go to the template, go to the team template and then what I&#39;m going to do.
Here is remove all the existing questions. If it gives you a problem with removing it the easiest thing is for us to simply create a new form.
You can click for example in this one. It gave me a an arrow and I try to delete it wicked and create a new form and avoid that.
Call it end of for the team. One, two, keep it simple here for the next page. And then we&#39;re going to click the import competency and this will allow us, sorry, import question, not competency.
The competency one will give you the one that is preloaded, but we don&#39;t want that. We want our edited version.
So we&#39;re going to click import question, click filter category, and then search for the custom milestone. And now we&#39;re going to add our custom version.
So notice how I edited it and add the word editing at the bottom at the, at the end here. This is now showing me my custom version.
So that&#39;s the process we have to follow to. Create the custom milestones and then add that to the, the template.
So I recommend to make this easier instead of deleting all the forms, all the questions on the form, simply archive it and make a new form.
So that way you don&#39;t have to go through all the steps of deleting all the questions on there. And if you get stuck and have any additional questions, let us know and we can help you with that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e2a130745db840a08df279844f1449df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So, this is a bug that&#39;s happening on the admin portal, I&#39;m sorry, the personal portal.

So, they&#39;re only selecting one, but we&#39;re showing all of them. That&#39;s the first this bug that we want to fix, and then while we&#39;re updating this bug, let&#39;s also modify the width of these columns so these dates don&#39;t get smushed into two rows.
It&#39;ll look cleaner. We have locks created. If we increase the width a little bit so that it can see, it can show all of the text in one row.
It&#39;ll make sure that it&#39;s, it&#39;s easier to read. That&#39;s for the locks created.

So you have increased compliance and other text kind of floating in there and this one is in the browser. So if we can put that floating out there like this text.
Then it&#39;ll match the rest of the text on the other images. Also, I feel like this, the line spacing between the two rows of text is a little close and if you check, ah you can check out this website, it may be helpful, so if you choose this color and put a font side here and let&#39;s say the width is and
then it&#39;ll give you the pixel size for the text and the height so that way we can make sure that it doesn&#39;t look too cramped here.
That&#39;s the only tweak that I have and then once we have this tweaked if you have access to Webflow you can go ahead and update the images there.

So when the Mpass team collects these evaluations as anonymous, you can see here it&#39;ll say anonymous for the Evaluate Tor, I mean the rotation in the Evaluate Tor.
And the rotation name is also remote and as well as the rotation dates, but what they can, and if you download it to PDF, it&#39;ll also show anonymous on that PDF like I said in the screenshot.
What you can do is go to the view recent response and there&#39;s a reveal button and they&#39;ll show who the evaluator was and the rotation details if it applies.
In this instance, I guess it doesn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t have a rotation name. This reveal functionality can be used to identify who completed the form.
So I don&#39;t Thank you. Thank you. I think this is a good permanent solution because you&#39;re going to be doing a lot of manual work as faculty or deans collecting these forms and then manually downloading them and sending to the students.
The question is whether this process is going to be manageable for a short period of time. I would say by before the end of the year, we can add a feature that will hide the reveal functionality from the students.
As long as this temporary solution works, then you can proceed with the implementation. And the other thing that I want to add here is the other the second way to get this information out of metrics is to run a report.
So you can run a report for the student and see what evaluations were submitted by preceptors for a specific date range.
So let&#39;s say. A rotation starts July 1st and ends on July 28th. It&#39;s a four week rotation. You can select a date range and then run a report for a specific student and it will give them the feedback they&#39;ve received for that time frame.

So for medical schools and all horses, essentially, when you create the curriculum, you right objectives for that curriculum.
So let&#39;s say if I were to go into a anatomy course, foundations of anatomy, and we have these course objectives, of course, goals.
So you can see learning outcomes, people call it different things, and each of these courses will have a set of objectives.
And then every lecture, every lab session, every small group session will have its own objectives. And what the faculty have to do is align your lecture objectives with your course objectives to make sure that you&#39;re not randomly teaching something.
So it&#39;s called a Curriculum Mapping that they do. And they have to do the same thing with other exams. All of that has to be mapped to the course objectives and those course objectives, in turn, has to be mapped to the school&#39;s objectives, what the medical school set out to teach.
What the American Association of Medical Colleges have done is, they have put out a national set of objectives that medical students in the United States should be following these set of, or should be taught these set of physician competencies.
When a medical school creates their objectives, they align it with the American Association of Medical Colleges objectives, which, so it&#39;s a top down hierarchy.
The highest level is the American Association of Medical Colleges. Then the medical school has its own objectives, which map to the course objectives, which map to every single lecture lab that the school offers.
We allow them to build that whole curriculum in metrics and map them together. So traditionally, what we had to do was if I was creating a course, for example, I would have all my course objectives in here and then go to the course.
Objective page and I can edit things in there. If I go to the mapping page, I can go ahead and select.
It&#39;s not a great example. So you have your course objectives on the left side, your school&#39;s objectives on the right side, and I can map it using an interface that allows me to select course objectives.
What we have done now is created an interface that allows them to use AI to assist in this mapping. Every faculty that teaches a medical education course has limited time and medical schools often struggle to get their faculty members to do the mappings.
Especially on all the lectures and labs to the course objectives because there&#39;s too many lectures and labs and each of them have its own objectives.
So this module, the way that it works is you go to a page called Mapping and I can use my filters at the top to select a particular course.
And then once I have, you can select a specific academic here and then it&#39;ll show you all the courses that you have permission to see.
And then if I expand on a course it&#39;ll show me all of the different lectures, small group sessions, and labs that are a part of that.
And if I expand that, for this particular session, small group session, there are three of them. And I&#39;m supposed to map each of these objectives to my core objectives.
So when I click expand, I&#39;ll show, I&#39;ll see the core objectives on the right side, and what I can do is manually map these to one of the more core objectives.
So that is still possible. They want to manually map it, but this Run Metrics AI Mapping button, they click on it, Metrics will connect to an AI model, and find objectives that align with this session objective.
So this session objective says something, and it&#39;s going to send that objective with all of the core objectives, and ask the AI to find the ones that align the closest.
And then they will get recommendations here, and the faculty simply have to click approve on these recommendations, or say that&#39;s not good.
So now I have this objective mapped, I can go to the next one, do the same thing. And I can approve it if I agree.
And that took me a fraction of a second, then just sit there and think about how this text aligns with each of these texts.
So with this, this tool, schools will be able to give faculty members something that will get their job done in a fraction of the time.
And currently, this is not even being done because the amount of time it takes them is not available to the faculty.
So most schools don&#39;t even have this mapping done.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cdddf7048bb24b9cb132acd7ae2ea3eb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[#7824108] LSL 2023 Sponsorship Discussion - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 6 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Ericsson. Great work on this. Love the changes. One thing one last thing that I wanted to talk about was the unify your team.
It&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;ll be better if we put that outside and remove, like, remove this browser so that it&#39;s like the other text.
So kind of put it up to on its own and since, since all of the other images have text kind of floating in there and it&#39;s not inside of a browser.
And the other thing that I wanted to ask you was if you can check the line height between these two because can you check if it&#39;s it should be around 1.5 times the pixel size.
So for example, if it, if increase the font size is 100, then the line spacing between it should be around 150 pixels.
So you can check to see if that&#39;s the case, because I feel like it&#39;s a little close to each other and compared to like the rest of the web, the rest of the text on the page.
Again, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m I would have to see the font and see. If it&#39;s, it makes sense visually, if you can tell me.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/98dedc09df3e42819d1b40e54ad8c4d1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[CO-320] Redesign images on the homepage - Jira - 5 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ericsson. So we&#39;ve been looking at these images and for the website for the real support from real people. Let&#39;s go with this image.
And for the font, we want to use the same font that we have on the website, and we&#39;re using, how do you say that, Monet Rhett?
I&#39;ll send it to you. That&#39;s the font that we&#39;re using, and we want to make sure that this matches that.
For next image, which is for the increased compliance let&#39;s use the same color combination for the text, we have the real support from real people, and let&#39;s use orange.
And for the, the browser window here, let&#39;s use something less thick and use a lighter gray. You can use the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, gray that you were using on this keyboard here, or the laptop here, and then make it about half the size
and also, All of the, yeah, I think there&#39;s a difference between the the thickness also between one screen to the next.
We want to make sure that it&#39;s relatively the same, because otherwise it looks out of place. Yeah, so we&#39;ll change the apply the font use the orange and the blue, and we can also get rid of this period here at the end, we don&#39;t need that.
And that&#39;ll finalize the design for increased compliance.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c79996bac0e641b9981bb73f1c5e7dc0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma - 6 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Okay Mike, so this is going to be an upgrade to the existing feature in metrics where we added the ability for students to request evaluation request switching of their rotation.
So the best way to do this is on msu.com, so if I log in michigan states server Bye-bye. And go to and if we go to a test student account.
You&#39;ll see that on the schedules page, I have the ability to request a rotation change. Once I request a rotation change, it&#39;ll say schedule request change submitted.
And then that will come to the administrative side, and on the administrative side, have a way to review and so it&#39;s a button called save, it&#39;s really approving it, and then there&#39;s a close button.
What we want to do is give them the ability to approve and decline. And then track the decline ones. Right now you can only see pending, open it up, and save it, which is essentially approving it, or you can delete the request.
There&#39;s no way to decline it. So this feature that we&#39;re going to be adding is going to give them a approved decline, so a green approve button, a red decline button, and a close button, and then also give them a way to add a comment field here that says notes, administrative notes, and then when they
decline it it&#39;ll change to decline status that they can look at, and on the student side, it will go back to it will go back to status.
Where it&#39;ll say request was declined, it&#39;ll say, I already started the design for it, so you can continue with it, request, change, decline, and then they can click on it to open it up and make edits to it.
So this is the administrative like a view and then they can see the comments, but if they&#39;re editing it, it&#39;ll say request declined at the top with the comments and they can resubmit it.
And we had to finish up the design for the administrative side where if I have something declined and I&#39;m coming back to looking at it again, we&#39;re going to show the comments at the bottom and then they can also add another comment so you can put that in. It&#39;s essentially a proven decline multiple
times and each time they&#39;ll be able to add a new comment. So this is the Figma design for it and you can go through the process.
On the MSU server of submitting a request, approving it and seeing what happens and then finish the design and then if there&#39;s any usability improvements that we need to do you can also add that and then that&#39;s going to be the one task.
The second follow-up task is we want to send an email when something is approved or declined that has the information in there with a link to go back to the same page where they can edit it.
So, last year you had added you had designed the email notifications, I think, for benefits when they&#39;re approved or rejected.
You can probably look that up and copy that. So that&#39;ll be a second task. So the first task would be adding the ability to decline and have all that tracked.
Second task would be email notifications.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5af7fe9d6edf41649cf7e5db425d53e1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 15 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Marcus. So in this video, I wanted to go over a couple things. First is the couple ideas that came out of the meeting of the team today.
They really like the concept and Mike had a good idea of overlaying some sort of graphic that will show some indicate timeline or progression so that as they&#39;re watching it and the series of images are coming, you know, when some when the video along the video is I had this gave me a thought and maybe
I remember a a Minecraft that I&#39;ve seen in the past and a lot of physicians have seen and this is called administrators versus physicians graph shows the growth of administrators in healthcare.
For the past what, 20, 30, 40 years and versus the growth of physicians, here&#39;s a few different things to note here and what this is showing is how healthcare.
Their administration has gone up. Quality of the care or the number of physicians that are providing care has not changed much.
What I, what we were thinking about was sort of overlaying a bar graph that is progressively growing. While the, or not even a bar graph, like some sort of line that is progressively growing as the video progresses.
And I also like, I&#39;m assuming this was intentional, like your video has, initially the videos, the photos are growing. Up slowly and then it&#39;s sped up.
So we can kind of use that as a time on as the first part is kind of slow. And then it accelerates how quickly the videos are the photos are showing up until we get to the end.
And that&#39;s when we. You should lead into the the final, the call to action or our company&#39;s information. So the first idea that came out of that meeting, the, another Rio had a comment that it was a little too long and we needed to maybe cut it down to 15.
I don&#39;t agree with that one. I think it&#39;s we can accomplish the 32nd timeline and just make it engaging so that people will stay there and watch it.
And even if they miss it next time they come back, they&#39;re curious and we&#39;ll finish the video. What I&#39;m currently sending you is in my experience with Mid-Journey yesterday on how to generate some of these images and what I can do there is based on the images that you found online, if you get the
high quality ones, I can use that to generate additional images that match them. So it&#39;s a, but the quality of that is going to be good and maybe we can use some of the older photos that we&#39;re finding in the earlier phases and then create similar images for later as they become colored.
So the other video shows how Mid-Journey works and I can create some graphics now. And the other thing is also, we can also set the aspect ratio to be 16 by 9 when we generate those images.
And then see, there was one more thing that I wanted to go over. So, having this was something that I started typing yesterday.
The, the text on the screen putting, like, we wanna put it, sort of, front and center, cause since we don&#39;t have any audio.
And as we progress through those messages, you know, we are painting the picture of healthcare as a whole and such as EHRs and various things that has, administrators frustrated.
But I also wanna, make sure we tie it back to medical education and the audience that is looking at this, they&#39;re going to be mostly medical school deans and administrators.
And some of them may not be directly involved with the hospital work which some of the text was focusing on.
So this one, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s how useful it is. I was thinking of you know, like, a lot of the doctors are frustrated with it, with the fact that they can really spend enough time with their patients.
And, you know, when you&#39;re in medical school and when you&#39;re in the past, you will spend a lot of time having face-to-face conversations with patients.
And now, patient. Visit times are cut down to like 15 minutes. And most of the time they&#39;re sitting over on a computer just writing down information and just asking questions without even talking to the patients.
Then coming when it comes to teaching because they don&#39;t have any time, they&#39;re not spending much time teaching to the residents and students.
And if they are teaching, then they&#39;re staying late to do so and getting home late. And then the other third one here is like when it comes to how they felt in medical.
This is something I mentioned the other day, how medical students are very excited to start their career and excited to be practicing medicine.
So this particular one is talk trying to tie those medical school deans and emphasizing how students feel about medical school and trying to ask them asking them, remember how you felt when you were in medical school.
We&#39;ll see you next week. How excited you were. And then the last thing is like, get back to what matters, your patients your student your students and then pj had this idea of your passion and then practice medicine, not software.
So, I wanted to throw this at you and, you know, you can work your magic and, you know, even if we don&#39;t use all of it, the only thing I want to try, want to make sure that we do is tie in medical school and medical education into the, into the mix of the texts that shows up.
So, that is directly relatable to the deans.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fdc82d65f3774c5e827f65f5551bcb64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum - 13 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mitch, thank you for sending that second file. Wanted to ask if you have a copy that has the information in one document because we have the availability on here.
What we need to do is be able to populate the course code here so that, and then we can also add the, whether it&#39;s the foundational or elective.
So for example, University of Georgia, I need to be able to say this is a CVM 771 and that is it&#39;s a required foundational course.
So if you have a version of this document that has the site codes in there, we can Thanks for watching!
Do an excel lookup and populate it. Otherwise, if you have a availability spreadsheet that has the course codes in it, that would also be helpful.
Because without this information we&#39;re not able to convert this into what we need for the optimizer. And for the required column, we can take care of populating that once the course information is added.
We&#39;ll simply look at the website and populate it with the yes or no based on whether it&#39;s required or elective.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a5f4e210789147eab22e89bca3769f62</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(2) Discord | #general-1 | Midjourney - 15 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Marcus, so we&#39;re been looking at mid-journey and the PJs here too. I wanted to share this video with you so that you can see what mid-journey can do in terms of creating these images.
So I&#39;m logged in as to the Discord account which is how you prompt and get images back. So once I&#39;ve logged in I can put slash imagine prompt and then I can say like different, there&#39;s a article that I&#39;ll share that shows you different types of prompts.
So I&#39;m gonna say use cinematic lighting. And then in the style of Ansel Adams who&#39;s a famous black and white photographer, I&#39;m gonna also add a prompt at the end that says aspect ratio 16 by 9.
And then click enter. The annoying thing in Mid-Journey is like you have this chat where you see everybody else&#39;s images even with the paid version.
So, it&#39;s gonna take a few, like a minute to generate. So you can see it kinda while it&#39;s generating. 31% Now I would say mid journey is probably the equivalent of chat GPT in terms of quality that it&#39;s going to be the best one And also there&#39;s a lot of advanced prompting that you can do like I only
use the aspect ratio, but they can do a lot more So here&#39;s the concepts that it came up with and, you know, we can customize the prompt to say female doctor male doctor.
Then once we have this we can. This U1 means that upscale one, it&#39;ll make it a larger size image. I want to move forward or I can also take one of these and create variations from it.
Let&#39;s say I like this last one. I can click this and it&#39;ll take create. Four variations from this one and I like this one.
I can also upscale it and it&#39;ll give me a high resolution version of that. I just got a little dot and go to the bottom and here&#39;s a high resolution version.
I should have said a black and white photo. That&#39;s why I made a color photo, but I think. I&#39;m going to send a video with this with this video to show some of the images that I was able to create using your notes from this from the storyboard so we can compare.
And see if this is something that we want to spend some time and generate images or simply go with the stock photos but either way the concept is really nice and we should move forward.
So here&#39;s the four variations. Once I got from that same image I could use the same doctor in different views.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/33da28dc760944f6a1acca9d47c0837b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Type Scale - A Visual Calculator - 1 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, so once I log into Webflow I can open up the designer and in the designer there is going to be a way for me to select different pages and so let&#39;s say if I choose feature servers, it will show me this page and I can click on different elements here and adjust the font size the location,

And then there&#39;s also a way to publish things to a staging server, metrics.webflow.io would be the place that we can publish it before and test it out before we put it on the production.
What I&#39;m focused on is specifically the font hierarchy. I want to get this right across the website and I&#39;m gonna do some more research and then I&#39;ll create a scale that I want us to use consistently and then we can implement that.

Nothing shows up on this table even though there should be a violation, I have to refresh the page and then it shows up.
And then once I&#39;m on the By People tab, I can&#39;t go back to the other tab. A bug we gotta fix since we&#39;re, since there&#39;s similar bugs.
On the, another bug that we have is in the curriculum setup page. If I go to the permissions. Director level permissions it shows up at the bottom instead of.
The separate tab and yeah, so it needs to be shown as a. A separate tab. Sometimes it works. So the first time the page loads, it shows up at the bottom.
But once I go back. It works fine. And now I&#39;m switching from here to here from curriculum permissions to event-based.
So if I try to switch from the curriculum permissions director leader permissions tab to the event-based session event types, it doesn&#39;t work.
I&#39;m not able to go anywhere from there, but if I go back to pull for me. I guess the problem is you can&#39;t go from a sub tab to a different tab.
So we have to make sure that we fix this and Ahem. Come up with a maybe what we have to do it instead of having these sub tabs in here.
It may be better for us to use a card here. So instead of so that so that we have managed full permission.
And then underneath that we&#39;ll have director slash leader permissions and in collapse, this, the full permission if you want to look at the other one.
Yeah, I think that will. This will work better if we&#39;re going to have problems with tabs. So this way the users know that the section is at the top and then they can scroll down to the bottom and look at the second permission set and if they need to collapse it, they can click on the collapse button
. And it&#39;ll be ideal if we have a expand and collapse button on the card so that the administrators know that it&#39;s clickable.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4f2b2dda608b473c9736c6a4d71017d7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sites - Webflow - 1 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, so this is what the editor looks like for Webflow and what I can do is go to the left side.

And when I go here, it&#39;ll show me Thank you very much. Thank you. The post template here with the sample post.
And I can switch to different posts here and then click on an element. And on the right side, I can adjust the font and the color, font sizes, the height.
And so for example. Here, it&#39;ll let me choose the font size of 16 as a default and then the height is 24.
Let&#39;s see if I can do something here. So, this here is defining what content shows up in this element, in this div tag, so this I just wish- it to bio, now it&#39;s not showing the body anymore, it&#39;s just showing the MyPro bio.
But instead of that, if I go back up to post body, it&#39;ll show the full text. Up here, we can also do the same thing here, h1, h2.
So I think that&#39;s for the h1. Let&#39;s go to h2. Anyway, I don&#39;t have all of it figured out, but some of the functionality is pretty easy.
We can change it and then the nice thing is also we have a staging environment. So when we are ready to publish it, we want to make sure we uncheck it, state, publish the staging, and we can make sure that it&#39;s all good.

Yeah, so this is a site that I&#39;m using to set up the scale that we want to use. And one thing that I&#39;m noticing is that it doesn&#39;t show me the, it shows me the size, but it showed me the line height.

We&#39;ll take a look at the JIRA Development Board and talk about some of the changes that we have implemented and explain how we&#39;ll be using it.
So the first thing is on the board itself we have this left menu, I mean on the project we have this left menu and the active sprints page will show all of the tasks that we are currently working on in this sprint.
And you can see here zero days remaining and then we can complete a sprint and then move that. Into the next sprint, if there&#39;s something that&#39;s incomplete and the board itself mirrors what we had in GitLab where we have to do, doing, needs testing, needs changes, code review and ready.
So ready is, is something that we&#39;ve renamed. It used to be called staging. It&#39;s called ready and it shows you the count of how many issues are there.
There&#39;s also a change to the table. It&#39;s, I mean, the, the view, the card itself. So it&#39;s showing you the name of the issue, what is called a summary.
Then, underneath that, it&#39;ll show you the module. Then it shows the story points. And for story points, we&#39;re using a Fibonacci sequence.
If you come down here, it&#39;s supposed to, well, it wasn&#39;t added as a drop down. It was, it&#39;s a numeric value for now, but it&#39;s supposed to only use the Fibonacci numbers.
And the higher the value, it means that more effort is required from the developers to fill this. So what we wanted to make sure is we&#39;re always updating the story points.
And if the the planning team, the product team I also want to, going forward, avoid the, the the terminology we&#39;ve been using, business versus developers.
You know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a product team that is doing the planning sessions and the product team is coming up with the specs, the design.
And the story points for the task, but the developers are going to be the one that ultimately decides what is the right story point.
So it&#39;s going to be that you&#39;re allowed to change this number as needed when you&#39;re working on a task. And there is this little four dots here.
This is indicating how long a task has been sitting in this status. So if I were to move this over to the next status, then I&#39;ll restart and you can see.
Seven days in this column, 20 days in this column. So that&#39;s what this is indicating. You can hover over to see the the number of days.
There&#39;s also if if a client was added to the task, we&#39;re showing the client name here. So in this instance, there&#39;s no module n a, but there&#39;s a client name added.
So that&#39;s what the board is showing. When we open this up, we can also see the details here and we&#39;re always using the standard template for bugs or features.
So if a user, if one of the metrics team members is creating a new task and they choose bug, it will pre-fill with the bug field the bug template.
If you go in there and choose feature, it&#39;ll show the feature template. Please know that bug is the default issue type, because we never want to misclassify a bug.
In the past, we had accidentally created tasks because the previous default was task, so we had entered a bunch of bugs as task.
To avoid that, I put the default as bug. So that we always make sure that it&#39;s entered correctly. And then there&#39;s also the status of backlog.
Then there&#39;s to-do doing any changes and all that, so the default status is backlog. But if something, needs to be done immediately, you want to make sure that you put it as to-do so that it ends up on the board.
I put this backlog status so that we&#39;re not cluttering up the developer&#39;s task list. So we want to make sure that it&#39;s always updated to-do so that it shows up on here.
So the next item here is this is more for the product team that&#39;s planning things out essentially this backlog view will show what&#39;s in the current sprint along with the story points, the title, the, the status and who reported it.
That&#39;s what&#39;s showing under the, under the task. And you can collapse it and see the next upcoming. Sprint and we can use this interface to drag and drop tasks from one sprint to the next if we need to.
We can also update the sprint at the bottom right here by choosing the appropriate sprint. So, if you&#39;re adding an urgent bug to the task, I mean, to the current sprint, you want to make sure that you update the sprint field so that it ends up in the developer&#39;s workflow.
Then we have the full backlog. In the full backlog, we have bugs and features, and as we work on it, we&#39;re updating the different fields.
So, in the, in the here we have something called, shade here. For features, we have something called design status. So whenever we are ready to start working on a, a feature, we put that design status as candidate.
Once the design status is candidate, it shows up on Mike&#39;s list so that he can start working on the design.
When he puts this puts a Figma link in there. It becomes design in progress. Then once the specs are done, it goes design specs done.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/82149f9c4b5b4f0db37e8b8c551ccea7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Context and Next Steps</pre></td><td><pre>So what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll start on the right side of the board and then work our way backwards. Okay.
Actually, not the right most one. So these, we need to spend another separate discussion reviewing this whole section here. Timing not right.
And yeah. Like it&#39;s good for an LS mark if we can review because if you&#39;ve already demoed with them in the past, it&#39;s good for us to revisit them because they may have some reason that they didn&#39;t talk to us at the time or move forward.
Same thing with ghosted. Yeah. Loss contract is most likely not going to lead us anything right now. Loss contract means that we were in a bid or something and we didn&#39;t get the contract, whatever reason it is.
So it&#39;s not worth investment right now because in the last two years we didn&#39;t get the contract, it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;re switching again.
Yeah. But this is definitely worth revisiting but I&#39;m not going to focus on that today. Client. Awaiting payment. So let&#39;s start with here.
MHC. Medical Health Centers. I was saying the name so that, yeah, this one I&#39;m going to put this in. Now here&#39;s one thing.
It&#39;s going to be a low value contract, but it&#39;s going to be a very high work. I don&#39;t really care too much about us closing this one because of the conversations that we had.
If they were going to say yes immediately, we were going to take them, but the amount of work that&#39;s involved for them is not worth it.
I definitely would like people to start using, especially since I&#39;m going to put in the notes tab right there. If we click on that.
So should we put that, I think it may be better here so that it&#39;s timed to that opportunity why we change the status.
Yeah, I mean we can honestly use both. Yeah. Because. This one in particular is really nice for right after a communication.
Yeah. So that way when you browse through the discussions we&#39;ve had, you don&#39;t have to read every individual email. Yeah.
Every time you have a little discussion, just post a note somewhere on the board here, summarizing the beginning and end.
Yeah. So I&#39;m going to say we&#39;re moving this. To having not client is not ideal fit for us right now.
So, and then notes like these can be, yeah, yeah, exactly. So like, there&#39;s the status notes and then there&#39;s the notes about the client, I feel like.
Because the notes about the client can be really useful. If you made contact with someone but then I end up having to talk to them, being able to go in and you can just be like, this dude is very iffy about the idea, this person seemed very excited.
Yeah. Like, you know, like little details like that so you know what you&#39;re getting into. Yeah, so attention has a direct link into here so it can populate certain things in here.
You can look at that also see if there is something that we want to do with that. So when we get to that, I&#39;ll show you some of the notes that were pulled in for attention right after the meeting.
Yeah. So, and then the other piece that we haven&#39;t really assessed is like all the custom fields that we created whether for the link, lead and for the contact and for the opportunity, whether we want to keep all of them, what do we need to be tracking.
So this particular one, for example I don&#39;t think they have an electronic system at all. So custom field, let&#39;s say if I were to put car and vendor let&#39;s see, we don&#39;t even have an option here and his choices.
No, probably there&#39;s a none option. So put it as none. And then the other one was how do we, how do they hear about us?
Let&#39;s see, lead sourcing was a referral, client referral. Okay. It was referred by St. James. I guess we don&#39;t have a good place.
Put that. So I&#39;m going to just put that as part of the opportunity. All right. So this one is out.
So this is an interesting one. We met the program director and, program director at a conference and she was taking over as DIO.
So this, this is a, this Ponce Ponce Health Sciences University and they have a medical school and they have this GMU department.
They&#39;re in Puerto Rico. They&#39;re she&#39;s taking over, she came for the medical school side and they don&#39;t have a big budget.
They&#39;re really like metrics and they are currently on e-value, they want to get rid of it. The quote that we presented to them initially, it was too high and then I negotiated with them for the first year to come down on the price or then that also seemed too high.
Eventually went back to like, let&#39;s try one program. That didn&#39;t work either. So it kind of just like fell through and what we need to do is revisit this soon for next year.
So the best next step here is email, either email, I email or someone email as me email, Lillian who&#39;s a pro, the DIO to get conversation started for next year present.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e657aa76f4604d42855de3bb1a79406b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Declined – Figma - 12 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, everyone. I wanted to share this video of the design that our team is working on for the decline functionality from the student portal after a student has submitted a request.
The administrators can either approve or decline the request, and once it&#39;s declined, they will see this new status as this request change declined.
And then, when they click on it, they&#39;ll be able to open it. It will show you the decline status and the administrative comments.
This comments field is also something new that we&#39;re adding. Same thing when they&#39;re editing the declined request. It will show you the status and the notes at the top and then they&#39;ll be able to update those fields and then from the administrative side, I don&#39;t have the design here.
It&#39;s going to have a third filter. Bye-bye. Where it&#39;s going to show the declined option. So that part is not, the design is not changing.
It&#39;s just we&#39;re adding one more filter there. So this is. Currently in the design stage, we&#39;re going to get this over to our dev team this week and so we can start working on it.
We have any thoughts after looking at this video, please let me know. And I&#39;m also sending a spreadsheet. That shows the academic progress report.
This was something that I had talked about last week that summarizes the rotations that the students have been scheduled to.
And I was planning on sharing an interface that you can use to test it directly, but I realized that this new report that we added, it actually is e-mailed to the administrator.
It&#39;s not something that&#39;s shown on the, on the screen, so I&#39;m attached it as a excel file. So once this is released, you&#39;ll be able to select the data and then says, click the e-mail button and it&#39;ll e-mail.
I&#39;ll use this excel file that has all the columns necessary to break down what the resident</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b958339f86a94f8db87bb114dc6120e7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>DV board - Agile Board - Jira - 28 August 2023</pre></td><td><pre>A dev project that we&#39;re using for planning, so under projects dev you can see that this This backlog allows us to see everything that is currently being worked on.
It shows us story points for each issue and I can click on it and make updates as needed and as I scroll down we can see the upcoming sprint and tasks that are being prepared and then the backlog.
So this back log allows us to see what needs to be prioritized and they can also move things from the backlog into a sprint if I need to like drag and drop.
Thank you for watching! To the sprint. So this is what we&#39;re using for our our development planning meeting and then for the backlog refinement meetings.
Thanks. We have this view that allows us to look at the features and bugs and it&#39;s going to be, let me see, there&#39;s a, Thanks for watching!
By creating. So using this functionality we could easily go through this in a meeting and then say what&#39;s the name?
Like it should be updated. It to us to make sure that everybody understands what the issue is because normally when a client facing team member is adding ideas to this list, they&#39;re simply putting it quickly into the into the backlog and during the backlog refinement or renaming it adding the design
status. So I can say this, this is something that we&#39;re going to pick out for working in the next sprint impact level, story points, the clients, and then once this is updated, it goes into the design planning.
So for that, Thanks for watching! We have the design status. Actually, I&#39;m gonna pull in a separate filter for that.
So Mike and I use this filter. Thanks for watching! That allows us to see anything that is a candidate design in progress or design done.
And then we make sure that designs are added, specs are added, and it&#39;s marked as specs done. God. So that&#39;s when we know that it&#39;s ready for developers to work on.
And then the last meeting that we have is the as she said, so backlog refinement, we go through it and add the story points, impact level, clean up the task, design Me meeting, we go through anything that has a design status.
And then during the development planning meeting, we go through the backlog and review review. So everything that&#39;s currently being worked on, update the status if needed, and then add new tasks into the sprint.
So for us to do that planning properly, we will need to make sure that all tasks are coming through one place and there&#39;s visibility into what things are being worked on.
If some things are in here and some things are in good lab, it&#39;s not going to be easy for us to plan things and also be aware of what&#39;s coming up in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/31fb1d336139441e98478dc01306f7d8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 August 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ, so in order for her to get these forms into the system she&#39;ll have to edit the milestones that we have in this in in metrics and I took a look at her form and the easiest way for her to edit this would have been to go to the edit manage questions page and then add a question like out of go to
the link question choose the one of the sub competencies and then she could have came back here choose link here and she could have rewrote those options so what she essentially what she would be doing is choosing the ACGME sub competencies that we preloaded and then this link option import link option
allows her to rewrite it in her own language if she wants to do that. But this functionality is broken so I added a bug to the backlog.
There is a second way she can do this and that is on the questions page. So on the questions page I&#39;ve created a new category called customized milestones.
And so what she can do is go here, write new narrative, and then go into one of these screenshots. So let&#39;s say this one is performance of procedures.
So that&#39;s going to be the, I believe the performance of procedures to the PC2. Add that here. Go back to edit.
And choose this link. And now you can see that it shows up as the ability to edit here. And then she can rewrite this however she wants.
So she can type in performance of procedures to ensure progressive development. And she can put that into here. And then each of these levels, she can rewrite how she wants to do it.
And once it&#39;s rewritten. She&#39;s going to save it and she&#39;s going to say save it under customized. I&#39;ll stones and after she saves.
All of them. She can make a new form where she&#39;s going to import from this category. Each of these questions that&#39;ll make her the new form.
And that&#39;s really the best. Process for her. And if this may be a good thing for you to schedule a, you know, 20 minute call with her and show her how to do it.
Or you can create a loom video. If you do schedule a call with her and you want to do it at a time when I&#39;m available, I can hop on the call if needed.
I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for you to transcribe all this for her. That&#39;s going to be taking a long time.
If it was minor tweaks, it would have been fine, but this is going to be a lot of text to type out.
It&#39;s best for her to do this. If she doesn&#39;t, if she doesn&#39;t have the actual text in a Word document or editable version let me see if I can do something here.
Yeah, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way for us to get the text out and right now the easiest thing is for her to contact whoever gave this form, and there&#39;s a way they can download it into a PDF or save it as a PDF.
That&#39;ll give her this, this form, and it&#39;s because this still looks like it&#39;s coming from Medhub. These screenshots are from Medhub, so whoever sent this email to her, I think it&#39;s some guy named Justin who&#39;s on the email chain, that person can save it as a Word document or PDF and then she can
copy paste.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6277210400594ae28bd54e9856bba4de</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Screen Functionality</pre></td><td><pre>And so I wanted to show this functionality here because it took me a while to figure this out. So if I go to projects or issues and then under screens we can see different screens that we can we can use in each of these screens are represent like what shows up in the when you&#39;re creating that type of
issue. So you can see that the main two that we&#39;re using for development is the metrics agile box screen and the metrics agile screen.
So if I go here I go here and configure, then I can see all the fields that show up there.
So for example, if I go in here and remove this and go to create and choose bug, you&#39;ll see that it no longer shows up.
So we have the priority and if we, we&#39;re going to rename this to if we&#39;re going to rename that to severity, then it&#39;ll get updated on their severity.
And if I go to the agile screen and then click this here and I remove this when I create the feature, it won&#39;t show the priority anymore.
So that&#39;s what these screen types are for. And there&#39;s more advanced things like issue types, screen themes and all this stuff.
I, I don&#39;t know how all of those stuff work, so, but we mainly want to focus on these two so you can customize it how you think is best.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/853e19b4441a4ed697d65ff5c4baa829</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Temporary Workflow for Handling Declined Rotation Requests</pre></td><td><pre>This is going to be a temporary workflow that we&#39;re going to use for handling declined rotation requests. So on the admin portal under schedules, clinical schedules, schedule requests, we have these requests that were submitted by our students.
Since we don&#39;t have a way to decline these requests, what we have to do is take a screenshot. Of what has been submitted and this can be done using a snipping tool on windows.
And this allows you to save an image into a Microsoft Word document and if there&#39;s an attachment that can also be downloaded and saved.
And then open up the student&#39;s profile and under the documents and certification we can upload that request so we are keeping it for our archives.
Once it&#39;s been saved. We can go back to the, the clinical schedules page and delete that request. This will allow the students to go ahead and resubmit it with whatever changes you want them to make.
So the first step is a screenshot, save it into word document. Upload it to the documents and certifications page on their profile and delete the record and we can inform the student that they can resubmit it with the changes.
In the future, we&#39;re going to have a declined option here so that there&#39;s no need to save those screenshots that will be available to the administrators under the declined section.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b3b8886d7b4e46f6a24bc993c6bf8e18</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Conflict Resolution in Uploading Session Schedules</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Prasad. So, the idea here is that if you&#39;re uploading a session schedule and you have the same time, same date, same location, and the same leader is telling us that these records are, you know, have the same lecture at the same place and it&#39;s trying to tell you that it&#39;s a duplicate.
So if they&#39;re loading something, a lecture is happening at this room with this faculty member and why is it being added more than once?
So, that&#39;s the reason that we&#39;re uploading it. And it&#39;s asking, do you want to create duplicates? If so, continue, continue the upload.
And if you can download the conflict as a CSV, then you could review it and confirm that it&#39;s, it&#39;s good.
If there&#39;s a better way that we can do this, I&#39;m, you know, totally open to it. But the goal is to tell them that there&#39;s a conflict and and give them a way to override if they want to continue creating the duplicates.
I can also change the language a little bit. The uploader file may contain duplicate records with the same values. With identical values, with the following identical values.
And so, uploader file may contain duplicate records with the following identical values. And then, listing out the values here. So it&#39;s essentially checking for conflict.
And we&#39;re also I should clarify that it, it could be date, time, and venue. So we have two records that are the same, happening in the same place.
It doesn&#39;t have to be all four. Daytime and venue. Daytime and session leader. So you can have a lecture that has a conflict that this person cannot be in the two places at the same time, or you can have a, an event that has a conflict.
So you have a auditorium that is booked. Twice. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to prevent here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bd1e4b2edd814715af1be8119086b42a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Jira Overview</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Guy. So, I want to start off with a big picture overview of what we are doing in Jira. And this may be a little disorganized in terms of how we implement all of this because it&#39;s, yeah, like I&#39;m not familiar with all of the different features in Jira yet.
So, what I&#39;m going to be doing is picking out those things that I&#39;m familiar with and then you can look into it more.
So, for example, right at the beginning when we log in we have a dashboard that allows me to see things that are assigned to me and the different projects that I&#39;m part of.
So, the two main projects, actually three main projects we&#39;re using in metrics are growth ops and content ops. So I&#39;ll start with the dev.
So in Jira we can create two types of projects. So there&#39;s the let&#39;s see if I can close this. It shows like various types of projects in here, but there&#39;s really two main ones.
One is a software project and the other one is a business project. So, if I&#39;m doing a software project, I have the option of having a backlog and I have spreads and it&#39;s more of an agile process.
If I go into growth ops, for example, and you can see there&#39;s software projects and then there&#39;s business projects, for business projects, there&#39;s no spreads and there&#39;s no backlog.
It&#39;s just a list of tasks and then you can assign statuses and work on those. Tasks with due deadlines. In our dev project what we have here is a backlog.
And these are all the ideas that we have collected from our customers and it&#39;s written up into A. So we have the current sprint here.
That shows all the sprint items. Then we have the upcoming sprint and then everything else is into backlog. And we can click on it and we can view and move it up to the next sprint or move around if needed. In a good lab, there&#39;s very limited search and filtering that&#39;s available.
So for example, if I have, I can go in here and say filter tasks from any of the projects that I have and I want to do more and let&#39;s say Okay.
If you go to all issues, it gives you a little bit more filtering options. So, I can go more and I want to show all the issues where design is done and it gives me anything that&#39;s design done, but I don&#39;t want anything that&#39;s already in development.
So I can say it&#39;s actually status, it&#39;s going to be status of to do. So anything that&#39;s done but it still hasn&#39;t been started on.
That&#39;s where this flexibility and I could turn on different columns if I want to add more columns. And from a search you can also use JQL to write your own queries to find information.
So this is very useful for us to find things and have a saved search for different types of jobs that we&#39;re working on.
Going back to the dev project and if we go to releases we are tracking everything that&#39;s released here and I can look up what went out and see all the issues for that which has been very helpful.
Then we have, let&#39;s say I want to customize this project and what we can do is go to project settings and in project settings I have issues and issue types and we have created feature bug as toot custom types and these custom types can either be created in the project or it can be universally created
. It can be created in Jira and used in multiple projects. So the way that Mark has set this up, I believe these are universal project task types that you can use in different projects.
If I open one of these up, let&#39;s say bug. It will show me all the different statuses that I can use for bug in progress, needs testing, needs changes and so on staging.
If I want to add a new status, I can do that. Then there&#39;s also, layout, if I want to customize the way the order of the fields.
Screens to customize. Let me see if I can edit this. So you can see how those fields show up on the page.
So if I create a new feature or bug. You can see that this is the order that these buttons show up and it lets me customize that.
I&#39;m going to go in there one day and clean out some of the things that we may not need so it&#39;s a little less intense.
And then Mark had also added a custom script. That pre-populates our standard template for writing up bugs and issues. I&#39;m not sure where he saved that, but that was also something that is really helpful because everybody that&#39;s writing up an issue can follow the standard template.
We can also create custom fields here and, In terms of apps, there is an app store that you can use to add extensions to the metrics for your instance.
We currently have a few of them that we have added. Sometimes, we&#39;ll have a few of them that we have added. For example, one of the things that we&#39;ve set up is Slack, so if I want to add a Slack Thanks for watching.
Bye. Whenever a task from Slack I can go to slash, zero, create, and then it&#39;ll bring up a model for me to create a task.
I can apply that to different projects. So, these are the different apps that we have turned on. Some of them are helpful, some of them are not.
You can check it out. Overall, the big thing is we have software project, business projects, each of those have different tasks types with different statuses, some automation that&#39;s built in and there&#39;s also a lot of automation that we&#39;re not using yet so, for example, if I go back to this page, it</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b1bd44348f084a579530d32bbe2a4f42</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>JIRA Cloud Integration in Slack</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, everybody. So I wanted to share this JIRA cloud that we have in Slack. It&#39;s been around for a while, but we haven&#39;t used it.
I actually finished updating it. I removed some of the apps that we are no longer using and then fixed the app so that we could use it for our task creation process.
So you can see here I was playing around with it under my account. If you want to make a new task in JIRA, you simply go slash.
JIRA and then you can either create, so if I want to create a new issue, I can say new task, it&#39;ll bring up the window and I can say does it want, do I want to put it to growth ops, dev or content ops.
And new task, I put a description here, pick an assignee, and then due date and then click submit and it&#39;ll create that issue in JIRA.
So it&#39;s really convenient for us to create these tasks directly from Slack. When it comes to dev tasks, it obviously doesn&#39;t bring up the template for those events, for those tasks, at least it can get those initiatives.
We can add potential ideas into JIRA, into the backlog and then we can go back and add those details later if we need to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/485de24f76894ffbb86ea067d3eea8b9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom: Understanding User Permissions and Evaluations</pre></td><td><pre>So if I take a look at the permissions for this user under system set up permissions and April&#39;s here, click edit and I scroll down it looks like they have specified specific templates and a role for the people that, for the evaluations that she should be able to see.
I believe the template part should be fine, but there, if you say that April should only be able to see evaluations that were done on clarity.
So, if you&#39;re not evaluating clerkship CAs, we&#39;re never going to see any evaluations because you&#39;re not evaluating clerkship CAs. Instead, it should either be blank, or we have to select all the student roles.
To another clerkship CA, Beth let&#39;s see, no, man. See you next week. Bye-bye. So, we&#39;re using a different permission set here where it says manage evaluations for site and it&#39;s showing all the site specific evaluations.

Currently when we have a review that&#39;s coming in for the administrative side, they&#39;re able to open it up and review and approve it, and it will show up under the approved section.
What we don&#39;t have is a way for us to track anything that was rejected or declined. So this feature is meant to add a new status or a request status.
And then under the request status menu, we want to have pending, declined, and approved. And if I click on declined, I can see all of the options.
All of the, all the student requests that were declined. And then on the student portal, if something is declined, then they&#39;re able to see the button to review and resubmit it.
So it would go, essentially go back to the similar status as pending. With, with the note that&#39;s I&#39;ll include a design for the student side.
So it&#39;s obvious what that looks like but for the admin side, it&#39;s, we&#39;re not going to be really changing any designs.

Bye-bye. She shouldn&#39;t, she should have access to it, but also said choose roles for whom is authorized to conduct evaluation reviews.
So, saying this is they selected her. So it&#39;s saying she could only review evaluations of anyone with her role. What they&#39;re, they&#39;re never going to have an evaluation because you&#39;re, you&#39;re not really evaluating clerkship coordinators.
What, what, what they need to do is either remove this so that the templates will be shown for all the student roles or specify each of the student roles.

The best way to handle this is for them to create an evaluation form. That&#39;s anonymous and open even on an open form type.
So once they set it up as a confidential form. So this is. And then templates and we have confidential setting.
So this needs to be enabled. And then we also need to enable the under assignment rules. And then should this be automatically available as an open evaluation enable that.
So this would allow the faculty members to submit this and anonymous evaluations are not automatically shared with the student resident.
And they will have to be published manually. So the faculty and the program director can go into the system and they will see it as an anonymous evaluation.
But they also have the ability, they can be given the ability to reveal who the evaluation is. So, collecting anonymously, but if this is something that there is you know, you want to identify what the faculty is, we can give access to the administrators to do that.

So if I go to institutional portal, but I&#39;ll switch over to program portal and then she, they have different regions of with different offices.
So we go to Western. And then go to schedules and master schedule, and they&#39;re going to. And that is true.
So let&#39;s see if we can figure that out. And if I click so this block schedule will have two views.
One, you can see the individual. All right, let&#39;s. Students on the left side, or you can do it by rotation, sort of saying, I want to see all the students and what they&#39;re scheduled to.
Or I want to see all the courses and who&#39;s in those courses. So if I go into one of these students.
Thank you. Thanks. Accounts and I try to assign a rotation. I&#39;m not getting anything here. So it, it tells me that there&#39;s something wrong with the setup.
So if I go to the schedules page, I can click edit. Look at the schedules. And what I&#39;m seeing here is that you, you either, you either have the ability to select a specific site and it&#39;ll only show rotation from that site.
Or if you don&#39;t select anything, then it&#39;ll show rotations for everybody, like all sites. So what we need to do is she selected one site here and and I think it&#39;s not showing any of the rotations because there&#39;s not going to be any rotations linked to some emcee marshfield.
So we&#39;ve got rotations. I don&#39;t see any rotations linked to that. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s not showing up. And let&#39;s double check that.
If I go to sites, you see marshfield view rotations, no rotations there. So they&#39;re choosing a site with no rotations and there&#39;s no schedules, not showing any rotations.
So you can explain that to her and help her troubleshoot that. And then the next step is to either, did she show the, did she pick the wrong site or did she forget to add rotations for that site?
Thanks.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f716db0072ac44d2a1f2d12c66a18534</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Customer Health Document Update</pre></td><td><pre>Hey PJ. So this is a document that I started last month to keep track of customer health and some notes.
We had a meeting about it. The second sheet on this, the goal was to create it at least. Source document to access servers and other things.
So on this, you&#39;ll see the list of all the clients. And if you highlight this and click on it, it&#39;ll take you to the production instance, staging instance and dev instances.
The I know I haven&#39;t checked all of them. So if you, if any of them gives you any error, please.
Let, let me know. So I think the Yale, for example, it says Yale. This is incorrect. It should be YSM.
Ysm.metricclamp.com. This up here. Yeah, and then I think Purdue, yeah, Purdue, may also have, yeah. This Purdue&#39;s one is also wrong, so it should be Purdue CVM, and let me see if I recognize anything else.
Yep. So this is the best place, and I&#39;ll pick I&#39;ll fix Purdue. But if you run off, run into anything else, let me know.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7221c4cc35f0427ba5c43844fb574961</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>ACGME Site Visitor&#39;s Requirements for Evaluations</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how we can meet ACGME site visitor&#39;s requirements for evaluations. So the site requires site evaluators requirements as upload evaluations in a combined PDF.
The evaluation should be specific residence fellow and not blind documents. Evaluations may be from individual evaluators. And or in aggregated format.
So for current residence, we have to submit evaluations for rotation evaluations for by faculty, 360 degree evaluations and semiannual evaluations.
So for example, for a three year program like to have six residents or fellows files to from each year. We go back to metrics.
What we want to do is on the evaluation summary report that can be by access by going to evaluations reports and evaluation summary if it&#39;s a three year program.
We want to choose a three year well, we can we can do a one year date range. Let&#39;s go to going back from August 1st.
2022 just to August 31st, 2023. And then this is going to bring up all of the evaluations that were assigned during that day range and all of the one year. Once that we&#39;re submitted.
So for these forms we can choose add all listed items or we can choose select a specific templates that we want to include.
And then at the bottom. Under the evaluate T section, we can choose the residents that six residents from PGY1, PGY2, PGY3, and that would allow us to pull multiple reports that includes data from all of these forms.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9b75d3166ae545fb97568b4fcf653133</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding ACGME Requirements for Resident and Fellow Evaluations</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at how we can meet ACGME&#39;s requirements from site visitors and this is for you about looking at resident and fellow evaluation performance.
So ACGME requires that training programs submit evaluations for a six, a two residents or fellow for each of the academic years.
And this, for example, for a three year program they like to collect six residents evaluations two from each year. And this should include their evaluations from their faculty, their peers nursing staff, other other support staff, as well as semi-annual evaluations.
So to pull this report, what we have to do is go to metrics, go to evaluation summary report that can be accessed by going to evaluations, reports, evaluation summary, and then we can do a date range.
So I, for this example, I&#39;m choosing a date range for the past year, load assignments, and then I can see all of the assignments that were made during that date range and all the submissions that were collected.
On the right side, then I can pick and choose all of the forms that apply to apply to the resident.
So it could be faculty value in the residence peer valuations, as well as valuations from hospital staff, such as nursing or allied health professionals.
So once you don&#39;t want to include any evaluations where the forms were submitted by the evaluator, such as faculty valuations, will we choose the forms where the resident is getting evaluated?
So let&#39;s say, for example, I choose this one. So if I choose all of them, then I come down here.
Under the group results section, I can choose six Bye-bye. Residence. It&#39;s two from each PGY level. So I&#39;m choosing these two.
So if you had a PGY 1 Residence evaluations, maybe it needs to be a, the role needs to be adjusted, but here I&#39;m choosing PGY 2, PGY 2, PGY 3, and PGY 3.
And then I can choose the Generate Report button, and metrics will email me a PDF for each of these residents.
One PDF for Adam, one PDF for Alison, one for Manisha, one for Tiffany. So four PDFs that includes results from each of these forms that I submitted.
And that&#39;ll give me what I need to submit to ACGMA.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a34b774346ed4daf8bc4fa3bc0011119</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updated Institutional Work Hour Report [🎥]</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Sam. So this is the updated institutional Work Hour report and this is on the institutional portal under reports And I believe it&#39;s under work hours and it&#39;s called institutional report and what we want to do is update that to our new reporting format and Rio can help you with information on how
that report pages can be loaded. Like I think that he has a standard page that he built. That we can reuse for all the reports.
So if you look at, for example, our schedule site rotator report, we have a standard format for it where we have filters at the top, options and then the table at the bottom that shows the results with the ability to export to excel.
So what we&#39;re doing here is essentially changing this report so we have the new filters at the top and then we want to be able to give them a date range to select data for a specific date range and we&#39;re using the same date range that we used in the previous version.
Programs will allow us to select one or more programs. The type of violation is a new field that we&#39;re adding so that we can select specific violations that we want to show at separate columns.
And then we want to include this include for users with inactive program affiliation. What happens is when they have select the date range and apply this and click the filter button or load, sorry, the generate report button, it&#39;s going to show the data here.
And we have each of the different training programs and metrics there. Compliance percentage. So the compliance percentage is coming from the existing report, but this highest training percentage and lowest training percent is something that is not being displayed as a column in the existing report
. We&#39;ll be right back. So we&#39;re going to look at the base for this particular program for this specific date range.
We&#39;re saying of all the individuals that are in that program, pick out and show the ones, show the individual with the lowest compliance percentage and the highest compliance percentage.
And these are different work hour violations that can occur when you select the type. So if you turn any of these check boxes on, then different columns will appear and we&#39;ll show the count.
So that&#39;s what this report is showing and when we click on one of these violations we also want to bring up a modal that shows the details of that violation.
So it gives us the name, the rotation, the details, the trainee comments, and the administrative comments. So if I go to metrics, voodoo.
Work hour violations page, you&#39;ll see that information being displayed on this page. So let&#39;s do a wide date range. So this is under the duty, our violations page.
You can see it has all this information and the same information we want to display on the model that shows the name, the role, the rotation details, the training count.
So let me know what questions you have after watching this video and along the other videos and for the front end part if you feel comfortable with pulling the existing report and modifying it, you can go ahead.
If not, I Rio is available to help with that. And then it&#39;s a matter of us modifying the backend to load the data that we need to display it on this table.
And then the P the export to PDF and Excel. We only need to do the export to Excel option for now.
And then that&#39;ll allow us them to manipulate data outside of metrics.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/93d7d38db143414e937334cfcee94b2c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom: Troubleshooting Schedule Issues</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Melissa, so I&#39;ve been looking at the schedule to see what&#39;s happening with the students Actually, we&#39;re looking at the students account to see what data She has associated with her and when I opened her profile I can see that we have the education history and on this page we&#39;re seeing a block schedule
assignment for May to June. When we go to the schedules page, I can see that we have block schedules for the fourth year students, but this schedule does not include the third year rule.
So even though she has a schedule, she&#39;s not going to show up on the schedule. Even though she has an excitement, she&#39;s not going to show up on the schedule because her role is not selected.
So to fix this issue there&#39;s one, what we can do is click edit, go down to CV and three blue, enable that, then save it.
Now we have CVM 3 and 4 students showing up here, and then we can go into this schedule, search for her.
Thanks for watching! And click edit, and we&#39;re loosing a, You back up database here, so it&#39;s a little bit slower.
Let&#39;s delete that. Thanks for watching! So now that data is gone, let&#39;s go back and delete it. Again, this is not your actual server.
This is a test environment, so. Thank you so much for watching. Delete account. There we go. So after we delete that schedule, you can delete this, delete the user.
Please let me know if this helps and if you have any additional questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8b1c5ca9137b4a82a9b6552212bafc93</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adding Grades into Metrics - Explained</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to add grades into metrics under the great book Menu item on the left nav.
We have grades on the grades page. We have two tabs rotation grades and course grades. The rotation grades allows us to add grades for clinical rotations.
There are a set of filters at the top for us to filter the grades that we have already entered. The first filter is for us to select an academic period, which can be a semester or academic year.
We can also filter by roles, a person, the graded course rotation, the site, and the add score button at the top right allows us to enter a grade into the system.
So I can select a student or a resident and then under the person field select a graded course rotation, the date when I&#39;m entering the grade, and then I can also link this back to, the student&#39;s schedule.
So there&#39;s two options for doing this. First option is select existing block schedule and metrics, and this allows me to select a particular rotation, and we&#39;re only going to see the rotation that is for this particular, and the weeks allows us to enter how many weeks this rotation was scheduled
for. If we don&#39;t have the scheduling data in metrics, we can manually enter that into the gradebook. So I can select a rotation.
And then start date, end date, and the number of weeks. Then the score field allows us to enter the score.
So the score, let&#39;s say, is 80. Score type allows us to define whether it&#39;s a score type for midterm, final, and so on.
The status, whether it&#39;s a pass-fail, or whatever the status of it is, we have entered into the setup. Secondary status if needed.
The description field, if I want to type in text, that will be included with the grade. And the comments section allows us to enter comments that we&#39;re providing.
By the preceptor for this rotation. So these comments can be entered manually here or as we&#39;ll review later, we can enter this from the actual evaluation form when it&#39;s submitted and all of at the bottom.
We have a way to. Attach a file. So if this evaluate this, this grade is coming from an evaluation that was submitted on paper, we can scan it and add it as an attachment here.
The second tab here for course grades. Allows us to enter grades for preclinical courses. And here I can select a course and then link it back to the schedule and add the score, the type, the primer secondary status, secondary status, description, and add comments and attachments if needed.
So between rotation grades and course grades, we&#39;re able to capture the grades for all four years of medical education, the medical school.
This information can be published to the student. The next the second way that we can add grades is from directly from the evaluation form.
So under evaluations and assignments. When we have a form that&#39;s submitted, we can open that up. And at the bottom.
Let&#39;s see if we have any of that. So at the bottom of an evaluation form that&#39;s submitted, if Gradebook is used by the institution, we&#39;ll see a section called Add Grade.
And from this evaluation form, I can fill out all the necessary fields to add a grade directly to the Gradebook.
And this is showing the same fields that we reviewed in the previous section, and it&#39;s going to be linked to this evaluation form.
So if we have an evaluation, it&#39;s best to submit that grade. It&#39;s not coming directly from the evaluation form, so there&#39;s a relationship in the database between the form and the grade.
If it&#39;s not coming from the evaluation directly, those grades can be added directly into the Gradebook. There is also a way to import grades into metric using a spreadsheet that will be something that we can assist with.
It&#39;s on our end.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ef33defdc7bc4ed4a65f6a8ab6ee64a8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Academic Progress Page: Tracking Student Requirements and Clerkship Rotations 👩‍🎓</pre></td><td><pre>All right. In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at how we can use the academic progress page to keep track of students requirements and especially for clerkship rotations.
So the academic progress page, which lives under this great book is something that both the administrators and the students have access to.
Administrators are able to see data for all of the students and each student can see information about their particular schedule.
So if I go here, I can click on, for example, the student here, Lucy Bennett, and this will bring up all of the different categories that are in our graded course rotation, and I can continue expanding that to see cup subcategories in each of the courses.
And then there&#39;s columns that gives us total number of weeks or credits for each category. So if we look at do something here.
See you next time! Bye! So, if we look at this column here, for Lucy Bennett, she has mandatory courses and mandate core rotations.
And then for the columns, we have a total number of required weeks for core rotations and a total number of required credits for mandatory courses.
That&#39;s showing up in black. And then the green number indicates how many credits or how many weeks she&#39;s been scheduled to already in our system.
And then the remaining is giving us a count of how many weeks this student still has to be scheduled for that particular category.
So if we go to our schedules, so right now, for example, we can see diagnostic medicine is so internal medicine is zero and under rotations i&#39;m going to map an existing rotation to internal medicine save that See you next time. Then go to the schedules and we&#39;ll look at Thank you.
Lucy and add her to the internal medicine rotation for four weeks and published come back to the schedule and now we can see that lucy has been scheduled to internal medicine 13 weeks and she still has 12 weeks remaining, I&#39;m sorry, she has a requirement of 12 weeks and she&#39;s been scheduled
for 13 weeks, so she has zero remaining. So this page allows us to look at each student&#39;s requirement and make sure that they&#39;re, they have been scheduled to the appropriate number of rotations for the core rotations and electives.
And from the student side, they can also do the same thing. They can log in and see what electives or rotations they still have to be scheduled to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cf80d31b32294761a0f310829b8969ad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setting Up Graded Courses and Rotations in Metrics</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at how to set up graded courses and rotations in metrics. On the left menu, under Gradebook, we have the Setup page, and the first tab on the Setup page is Graded Courses and Rotations.
A graded course or rotation is essentially a list of all the preclinical courses or clinical rotations that are offered at the institution, and it&#39;s categorized into into groups based on whether they&#39;re required, not required, or whether they&#39;re core clerkships, or whether they&#39;re electives
. So these categorizations can be determined by the school, and each course can have a specific number of credits, and each rotation can have a specific number of weeks that needs to be completed for it to be for it to count towards the, to the student&#39;s grade.
So first let&#39;s take a look at the filters at the top. We have a way to see which of these courses or rotations are active or inactive, and then I can also filter by whether the courses and rotations.
And we&#39;ll start by creating a new weighted course rotation. So I&#39;m going to say, I&#39;m going to click on Add Graded Course Rotation, and let&#39;s say I want to deal with courses first.
So we&#39;ll call this there are five fields, actually six fields that we can fill out. On this window, first is whether it&#39;s a course or a rotation.
So we chose course, next is code. So I&#39;m going to call this required. The name is going to be mandatory courses.
The description I&#39;ll put in, these are mandatory courses. And for required credits put in 50. So now I&#39;m defining a, essentially a category.
Of mandatory courses, and it&#39;s saying that the total number of mandatory credits that I have to complete is 50. Click save.
And I scroll down, and I can now click to expand that category. And underneath that category, I can add all of my mandatory courses.
If necessary, I can also create subcategories underneath it. So let&#39;s say there are mandatory courses, and I want to have subcategories for all of the different first year courses versus the second year courses.
I can have two categories, one for first year courses and another one for second year courses. But for the sake of this example, we&#39;ll simply create the courses in here.
So I&#39;m going to click. Add add button underneath the category. And then let&#39;s create our anatomy course. So for code, I&#39;ll put in A N T one oh one name is going to be anatomy and description.
This is the anatomy course. And we&#39;ll put that as five credits. So. So you cannot have two courses with the same code.
So which is why we received an error says this course already exists. So I changed that to anatomy 102 and we&#39;re able to have this five credit course under this mandatory.
Very quickly. So I can keep adding as many courses as I want. And the idea here is that the total number of mandatory courses that the student has to take is going to be 50, but the school may offer more than 50 mandatory courses.
And the student sorry, for mandatory courses, you want to have the total number of courses to add up to the total category.
For elective courses, on the other hand, the school may offer more elective courses. Than the total number that is required.
So if they require 50 elective credits, the school may offer up to 200 credits worth of elective courses. And the students can pick and choose to make sure that they receive at least 50 credits.
So that&#39;s how we set up all the courses for our school under the gradebook. For rotations, we do the same thing with weeks.
So I want to click add new. Graded course rotation. I&#39;ll change the first drop down to rotation, but in the code as core.
And I&#39;m going to give the name as core clerkships. Acquired weeks is 50. And if I expand on the core clerkships I can add each of the clerkships.
It&#39;s like internal medicine, it&#39;s a code of IAM, internal medicine, and let&#39;s say that&#39;s 12 weeks, save. And now we have total number of credits for 12 weeks for internal medicine and that is added underneath that core rotations category.
So this has been an overview of how we create greater core rotations. In metrics which allow us to define the total number of credits for each course and each rotation, as well as the total number of credits or weeks that are required for the category and then in the next video, we&#39;ll take a look
at how this can be helpful in planning out to scale. We&#39;ll take a look at our schedules.

So metrics.dev here and then slash lottery. Once you&#39;re on this page you can see the setup for the lottery and we have set this up for CVM 4 with all of the sites.
And if I want to see the different blocks that are set up, you can go to the previous phase. So there&#39;s different phases of the lottery.
It starts with adding all the sites and roles, then it goes to creating blocks. And on the blocks page, these are a bunch of sample blocks that we put in.
This is for the sake of testing. It may not be the actual blocks that you have for these rotations. And I&#39;m going to advance.
So student preferences is a phase where students can actually add preferences. Now, we have this test account that we have used in the past.
That&#39;s called s-a-student.com. Password is l-m-u-mitch. And on this user&#39;s account, so I have to do here. Okay, so it is now in the student.
And now I see the lottery page. And if I go to the lottery, I can select preferences, I don&#39;t have any preference preferences right now.
I click new, and then when I select the site. It&#39;ll give me all the blocks that are in the system.
There are, this is one of the known issues that we&#39;re fixing right now, where if you select the site, it&#39;s still showing you every block that&#39;s available not the specific one that you put in.
Like it should be filtering by the specific site. I can click add. And come down to the bottom to submit.
We&#39;re also going to be changing into autosave. And this allows me to adjust the ranking. So we&#39;d love to have your thoughts on the different columns we have and confirm that we&#39;re showing all the information that is necessary.
For the students, as for like the issues related to sorting and things like that, we are addressing that as we speak.
It&#39;s something that the team is working on. Today, the but the one thing that we want to make sure is we&#39;re showing everything.
For example, is there any code or anything that needs to be shown or is the name of the rotation and the name of the sites?
Is it sufficient? And for the blocks, we have the block dates. And these are currently entered as two-week blocks, but it does, it doesn&#39;t matter for for now, since these are going to be two weeks when you actually make the act, the rankings for the students, you&#39;ll have some of them that
are two weeks, but most of them will be four-week blocks. And that setup is going to be done later.

second tab which is the score types and what we can do here is specify a particular type of academic activity that we want to consider as a grade so for example if I go in here and choose on the right side we have a button add score category click on it then I can select a course and this is selecting
a course from our curriculum then I can give it a name so let&#39;s say this is going to be mid-term total points gonna be out of a hundred of that description field that I can add and the date that this is going to be viewable on the personal portal if I want to do that then click save so I have mid-term
total points and the publish date that I can add so we have another grade that we want to add let&#39;s say for the same course I want to also add the final grade so if you do that I click add score category again select the course so enter the name final grade define the number of points add description
if i want to and choose publish date we&#39;ll skip publish date for this example and click save next we have score statuses so score types allows define what we&#39;re grading and score statuses will allow us to define how we&#39;re going to grade it so at to add a new score status we can click the add score status
button and let&#39;s say this is going to be pass fail name is pass and sometimes we may have a primary score type and a secondary score type so pass fail and if they pass we may want to have a secondary score type this is something that some score status that some schools may use but for more schools it&#39;s
either going it&#39;s going to we&#39;re only going to use a primary type. So name, type, and description of the three fields that we have to fill out.
Click save. Okay, it&#39;s not a lot I&#39;m going to create it because we already have a duplicate, so we already have a pass in here.
So, if a score type exists with the same name, we won&#39;t be able to save, create another one. And if a score type has already been used.
It&#39;s not like, it&#39;s not letting me just edit it. So we have pass fail as the score status, and then we have midterm and final as the score type.
Now, if we go into the first tab, here&#39;s where we can define all of the different courses and rotations that are available in our training program.

And then would send it to them via PANDADOC for them to sign. And this would only apply for our contractors, and if if it&#39;s for anybody that&#39;s an employee, we were still working on the paperwork for that.
So I&#39;ll send this to, you already have access to PANDADOC, and what I want to confirm is that you have access to the template, and we also have some drafts that we wrote.
So for example, Rohan, Vipul, Prasad, Vish, Kwemi Maria, Guillerme, Marina, so. Let&#39;s say, for example, I opened up Marina and we ordered to put July 1st when we had the adjustment of the salary, it should have the addresses and.
We also have some draft here of her responsibilities and here. You we can pull this let me see if what&#39;s updated or not.
So, we have updated Marina to be 45. Guillerme has been changed to a $4,500 fixed rate per month, and I&#39;ll send that to you separately.
And then for Prasad, Whipple, and Vish, we&#39;ve added a 10% raise. And for Maria, we&#39;ve also added a 10% raise.
She&#39;s a salaried position. I&#39;ll send this to you via email for the developers. We could go ahead and set this up and send it to them.
They&#39;re not really going to have any changes in their responsibilities. I would like to hold off on sending it to Maria until we put down some responsibilities in there, since we&#39;re trying to put a.
Maybe a score cards and things like that. But for Bev&#39;s we can send that out. And then for Rohan, he&#39;s not getting the race yet since he started recently.
So in my email, I&#39;ll summarize this in terms of amounts and their titles. Subs by www.zeoranger.co.uk And we should already have drafts and I&#39;m happy to look it over before we send those out.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a865684331c845f7bd83ba48e30454ef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Work Hours from the Resident Perspective</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at work hours from the resident perspective. The first thing to note is that residents and fellows cannot log work hours if they do not have a published schedule for that day.
When we arrive on the Work Hours page on the resident portal using the left menu Work Hours link, you&#39;ll see a calendar view, and this is default to a weekly view for this week.
If we want to go back to the previous weeks, we can use the left arrow. We want to go forward in time, we can use the right arrow.
The today button will allow us to go back to today&#39;s date. The month view will allow us to switch to the month view.
So, to log work hours, again, we have to make sure that we have a schedule in the system. And when you go into metrics and you try to log hours, there are two ways to, actually three ways to enter work hours on the desktop view.
First is we can drag and drop one of these tags at the top. For example, if I&#39;m trying to log work hours for the day, I may use a regular shift.
So this is going to be the most commonly used shift tags. You would use a regular shift. That indicates that you worked during the day as a normal regular clinical shift.
And when you drag and drop it to the calendar, it&#39;ll bring up a window where I can specify I can specify the exact start time and end time but one of the things I can note here is that it&#39;s telling me that there are no schedules on this window that came up it&#39;s saying no schedules have been published
for this day on the block schedule. Work hours can only be logged for scheduled days. Please contact the schedule administrator to publish schedules.
So if your resident is contacting you saying that it cannot log hours, the first thing to do is check the block schedule and make sure the schedule has been published.
So let&#39;s go to today&#39;s date where I know that there is a schedule published. And I will drag and drop again and now not</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2e04cbe9820442f0bf7431782e098959</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding the Lottery Functionality 🎉</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mitch.

When you&#39;re logging into this testing environment, you can use the account test a student at metricslab.com test the password is going to be LMU Mitch or lowercase in one word and once you&#39;re in here you can go to
the lottery page by putting the it in the URL slash lottery, fix something there. This is on the admin side.
I have three lotteries that are running and we have a CV. M for this one is being run for CVM for blue.
Double check the role of our student. By the way, you can you can access the administrative side of lottery by logging in.
As your account. It&#39;s going to be your email address with the password lmumich with the lowercase in one word and then putting it into the URL, the lottery URL.
It&#39;s not going to show up on the left menu yet. So on this page if I go to CVM four and I go to users state student is actually CVM one.
That&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t showing up. Let me fix that.

I mean good evening Marcus For Karen Berger, I don&#39;t really have much to show here on the screen.
She is from Lewis Weiss Memorial Hospital and they have have been with Metrix for many years. They&#39;re one of our earliest clients, either one of the first five that we onboarded.
And the hospital is a very small community hospital and they are currently going through bankruptcy. Actually, they&#39;ve been going through bankruptcy last year.
They have a new owner, I believe. This is something that we don&#39;t really want to discuss with them. I&#39;m saying this for contacts.
They haven&#39;t paid our bill last year or this year. It&#39;s like a $7,000 bill. And Karen and the program director and others are very, you know, embarrassed by that situation and, you know, they&#39;re because of the bankruptcy, they are not prioritizing our bill.
And because they were one of our first clients, we also have been flexible with them and because we don&#39;t want to shut off their software and this year Karen you know called us and said I don&#39;t know what in this bill is going to be paid if you guys want to turn off the system go ahead but we&#39;re still
continuing to provide the services and support They need the program, and it&#39;s not really within their control, and they&#39;ve been loyal to us for many years.
So I&#39;m not as familiar with their training programs. Workflows. Chris usually works with them. One of the things that we can emphasize with Karen, she is a very heavy support user.
She&#39;s someone That&#39;s not very tech-savvy. So when she&#39;s trying to do something she may get stuck and she reaches out to us and we do We did over the years have done quite a bit of hand-holding and these are not difficult things or that and The team finds it easy to answer questions and help helping
her with troubleshoot certain things. And she is very appreciative of the help that we&#39;re providing, and this is one of the main reasons that she really likes Metrix.
So that&#39;s a good story to focus on, and she will really praise us for support. And then the other piece that we can also emphasize with her is competency-based milestone.
One of the things that we do really well compared to other platforms is, well not even compared, I I&#39;ll just, I&#39;ll say that there&#39;s no need to compare with the other systems.
We can simply talk about where we do great. Go into and show you something here. So these are the DCGME&#39;s milestones.
So every specialty in the United States have a milestone&#39;s document and these are something that every training program has to report on biannually.
So, a program director has a C, Critical Clinical Competency Committee that they define, and those individuals work with the program director to specify where each training stands on these milestones.
Metrics has all of these milestones pre-loaded and allows the administrators, the directors to create performance evaluation forms using these milestones.
So you can drag and drop them onto a form and build your forms. So I recently helped Karen with the, updating some of her forms.
So I know that she went through that process, and it may be a good point to bring up of how she builds the forms, how easily she can do that, and does tying in the milestones and what she, they do with the data.
We also can talk about if she has any insight into how the trainees and the faculty members are finding the system.
Specifically, are there time savings or numbers that she can provide because that&#39;s something that I&#39;m looking to identify for myself or some other calculations like how much time is it saving their residents, how much time is she saving her, how much time is saving the faculty members, and the compliance
percentage is another thing. Important thing to note, you know, was how is their compliance percentage in getting evaluations completed on time?
Yeah, so I&#39;m not sure of all the things that she&#39;s going to talk about because again, I&#39;m not familiar with their setup, but definitely support their evaluations, and then any stats that she can provide.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fce246b85ac54296bdb17d06d809ca0e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>ACGME&#39;s Work Hour Rules in Medtrics 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to start to look at ACGME&#39;s work out rules and how metrics helps organizations track those work hours and make sure that students, sorry, residents and fellows are not violating those requirements.
And these work out rules rules are critical to maintaining compliance with ACGME, and the ACGME, or Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, is the nonprofit organization that gives hospitals the ability to run these training programs.
And it&#39;s important that these training programs meeting their rules and otherwise they can have citations that are issued to them or they can have their programs closed.
These ACGME workout rules are applied to anyone that is in training during their residency or fellowship. And there are several rules that we have to adhere to.
Metrics automatically checks for these rules when trainees are submitting their work hours. So in this first video we&#39;ll take a look at all the different types of violations that metrics can check for.
So So here on the Work Hour Logs page, we have a legend that lists out the different workout rules that we check.
Eight hours off. This means that when a trainee is logging hours, they have a lot of work to do. to be they have to have a gap of at least eight hours between shifts for them to be compliant. So let&#39;s say if I worked for a hospital from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and they tell me to come back in at 6 p.m., that&#39;s
a violation because I only have two hours off, one hour off between those shifts. So once I get off my shift, I have to be off for eight eight hours before I can come back in for another shift.
The next one, 80 hours. This violation is, rule is checking for, whether trainees are getting overworked. A resident or a fellow must only work a maximum of 80 hours per week when averaged over rotation.
So remember that in metrics, residents are scheduled to rotations on the block schedule and in order for them to complete their training they may be doing rotations of different lengths some four weeks some two weeks and what we have to do is take those total number of hours that are logged by that
resident during that rotation and average it over the seven-day week period. And if that average is going greater than 80 hours per week, then that&#39;s a violation.
Third night, so there&#39;s a shift type that we have in metrics called in-hospital call, and a resident is not allowed to work more than, every third night in hospital call.
So what that means is they can work one night, like overnight, and then they cannot work the next night. But they can work the following night, so if they&#39;re if they are asked to work back to back nights on a hospital in hospital call, then that&#39;s a violation.
24-hour call. This is a rule that states after you have done 24-hour shift, you have to be off for at least 14 hours before you can work another shift.
Next one it says 24 plus four hours. This is saying that a resident can work for 24 hours but they can then do another four hours of administrative work if they need to finish up paperwork.
So 24 hours of patient care, but the four hours of administrative work, they cannot be seeing any patients during that time.
Next is moonlighting. So trainees are allowed to log moonlighting shifts. But first year residents are not allowed to moonlight. So if we have any first year residents logging work hours and they&#39;re selecting moonlight, that&#39;s a violation.
Home call, that means they&#39;re working from home and waiting for it to be called in. And if they are called into the hospital, then they have to use the in-hospital call shift type.
Remember that PGY-1s or first-year residents are not allowed to take home call because they need more direct supervision. Days off, so you must be off more than at least one day off per week average over rotation.
So if you&#39;re working over a seven-day period you have to be off at least one day. So it doesn&#39;t have to be the calendar week.
We&#39;re speaking about it from the context of any seven-day period. You have to have one 24-hour period off. So those are the ACGMEs violations.
That we track in metrics.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7d5b3263d5f043ef9f417351dbf99109</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Analyzing Financial Reports 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Alejandra had a chance to look through the report and great work on this We do need to check a few things here So one thing I noticed is that We have Kaiser Permanente 2023 showing $1.97 for services and $30,016 for subscription.
So when we go into this other report I filter for Kaiser Permanente here. And then when I go down to 2023, we can see that we have an invo- choice 1267, and there&#39;s three things for subscription, so what we can do is add all three together, and we get 182, let&#39;s see.
It&#39;s gonna be services. 182.926.96. That&#39;ll be for subscription. And then for services, the only thing that we had was data migration consulting here.
So this is one, two, three, four, five. And this adds up to $15,000. So we will put that here. And then for last year, we will go to here.
So it&#39;s one, two, three. 172, and I believe we have that here. So we can move this over to subscription and last year we did not have any services.
It was all subscription and the year before we have one two three four. All of this is one. So this is a lot of confusing.
Two, three, let&#39;s see. So it&#39;s 155.721. There and goes here like this and then the year before that. And. Thank you.
This is 2019. And to 20,000. So that&#39;s right. So I think that&#39;s good. And then what we&#39;re want to do is see if there&#39;s anything else like that.
So, for example, this looks not accurate. There&#39;s almost never going to be a service that we&#39;re offering that&#39;s that much.
It&#39;s going to be a lot less. So you want to make sure that this is correct. Yeah, so you can look for any big numbers like that and see if it needs to be corrected like this one here is going to be subscription.
Thank you very much.

In terms of status, we want to have approved and declined. So if a student submits a request, when the administrator looks at it, we want to have an approve button, a decline button, and a close button.
If I click the Approve, it&#39;ll bring up a sweet alert that says, are you sure you want to approve this rotation request?
And I can click Approve or Close. If I have a request that I want to decline, I will click the Decline button.
It will bring up a sweet alert that allows me to click Decline or Close. And I also want to give the administrators a way to put a comment here.
So when the administrator is declining it or approving it, they also have the option to write a comment. So it&#39;ll be a notes field.
With a text box and that gets saved and when the student and the notes field you can also we also want to put a little so it&#39;ll look like this font here with the text under it that says notes are visible to the trainee.
And then once it&#39;s saved, it&#39;s gonna be visible on the student&#39;s side when they look at it. So if we go back to the student&#39;s side, oh, one thing I wanna say, I want to mention is once we have the decline option, we also want to show that as a status.
So pending, declined, I mean approved and declined. And if I go back to the student portal. And go to Schedules, it&#39;s going to have a schedule request change submitted.
If it&#39;s declined, it&#39;s going to turn red and it&#39;s going to show schedule request changes. Declined and if they click on this button they&#39;ll see the notes and and we want to have a decline status at the top.
We can show that. As a bootstrap label at the top right here that says decline One small tweak to make here is any fields that don&#39;t have any data, like attachment, let&#39;s put NA or none so that it&#39;s clear.
And if something was declined, they can edit it and resubmit it to the administrators.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/23885bb545394939b5c31c3b6b29ef6e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Usability of the Report 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so for this report or download, I wanted to provide some feedback to improve the usability while we&#39;re updating it and I&#39;m assuming this should be my tweaks.
If it&#39;s a big problem, please let me know One is as we scroll through this report. It&#39;s hard to know when a week starts.
So if we can put You can always put Monday on a new row So we have two columns. If it&#39;s Sunday ends on the left, instead of showing Monday on the right side, we can start Monday on the left side, and then also use a black.
Sorry it&#39;s not black it&#39;s actually three three three three three color for the cell background for monday and white for text so this way as you scroll down the page you can easily identify where a week starts and we don&#39;t want to do that for the other other days only for monday so that we can identify
where a week starts also this could be due to missing data. We want to make sure that the event is shown as well as the speaker and the venue.
And this may not be showing it because they never added it. But if it&#39;s not being shown on the report.
Put speaker, speaker in bold with a name in regular text, and then venue in bold and name of the venue or location, I think is what we call it, and the name of the venue.
So in one row underneath the event name. And we can put that in italics. The last thing is, instead of using this military time, let&#39;s use AM and PM.
So it will be 1 PM till 2 PM. And we can increase the width of this row, this column, to make sure that it shows up on one line.

that pops up that says are you sure you want to approve this rotation swap rig? Request. Yes, and the buttons should be approve or cancel.
Same thing for reject. If we get a request and we want to reject it, we click the Reject button and says, or instead of Reject, let&#39;s use a decline.
So we click the decline button that says, are you sure you want to decline this rotation swap request? And we also need to use buttons that are standard.
So if we go to the other models that we have in the system, this is how we show the buttons For some reason we&#39;re using these large buttons here.
Let&#39;s get rid of that and on the top right We want to have pending approved and declined as statuses so we can and then on the student side, if something is declined.
If something has declined, it will show up with a status of decline next to it. And let&#39;s log back in there.

So in this video, we&#39;re going to review what the students see when they are making a request to switch or Select an elective or rotation.
They want to complete we&#39;re looking at the student portal at Michigan State University on a testing environment and I&#39;m using this one because we already had some test data and this is not a real student&#39;s account but for the sake of testing, the team there used this account.
So if we look at this schedules page on the student portal, we have a list of different rotations that are scheduled for the student for the upcoming year and on this on this page we also have a way to see contact information for that site and when.
When we have a scheduled rotation that allows a change, so for example we have a placeholder rotation here, this is meant to be an elective, the student can go in there and request a rotation.
By selecting a site, selecting a rotation, and then fill out the details for that clinical experience. So I can say this is going to be at this hospital.
What&#39;s the rotation name? What course does it, or, or curricular requirement does it fulfill? Who&#39;s the, who&#39;s going to be the administrator there?
That person does not exist in the system. I can fill that in. And then, who&#39;s going to be the supervisor, fill that in, and I&#39;ll also select the dates that I want to do this rotation and upload an attachment.
This could be a signed approval or some sort of document that I want the, the, the team at the, my institution to just see, and I also can add more notes here.
So once this is submitted, it&#39;s visible to the administrator who can then approve it and the student receives an email saying that the rotation was approved.
If it&#39;s rejected, it comes back to them and they can resubmit it. You can see here, we have something that was submitted in the past, and I can look that up.
And if it hasn&#39;t been approved or rejected, I can also edit it and make changes. And resubmit it. If it&#39;s already been approved, then I cannot make any change.
So this is what the student portal looks like, and then on the administrative side, as we saw on our meeting last week, administrators can review what was submitted and approve it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0c4b8087b8ba4364bed0db7683e4db25</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Tweaks and Updates for the Student Side of the System</pre></td><td><pre>I wanted to summarize some tweaks that we need to make on the student side.

The rotation so we can hide this column for now commented out for the open slash total week we can remove the open part and simply show the total slots that are available and then for the drag and drop let&#39;s put that
on the left side all the way on the left side and on the right side add a action column where you can delete and enter if you need to and then when you delete it you ask you have a sweet alert that shows are you sure you want to remove this rotation from your rank list and then when they click yes it&#39;ll
be removed. For the administrative side Actually, so one more thing from the student side, they need So
, on the administrative side for lottery, one small tweak that we need is we have to add a way to delete a lottery and also a way to go back in previous phases.
So I should essentially change this to next phase and then add a button. This previous phase so if someone made a mistake they we can correct it and then for we also need to have a way to delete a lottery and that delete option later on we can lock it down based on some criteria but for now we have

it&#39;s not closed yet so in phase five so it closes it should be the sentence and the other Another major problem is that there is only a way to advance the phase, but never a way to go back, which is a big problem because if you miss something, you miss the block, there is no way to go back and fix it
. It would be ideal if there is a way for us to also go back to the previous phase and either having another button that says previous phase and then a next phase button.
Yeah, that&#39;s the best I can think of right now as a solution since we have so many phases. We can improve that later, but at the very least having a previous phase button so the client makes a mistake, they can go back and fix it.
The student side. So, on the student side, we don&#39;t need to list out all of the sites. All of the roles.
We can simply show the name, the open date, the closed date, and Well, it&#39;s kind of redundant. There. The open date and then status with the lottery closes on this date and we don&#39;t need to show this twice.
Then when I go to the select preferences Let&#39;s comment down the rank by so we don&#39;t need to show the number of students that ranked it and for We also need to, I&#39;m not sure if this is showing total slots or open slots.
If it&#39;s showing the total slots, let&#39;s keep that. But we don&#39;t need to show the open slots. Remove open and then keep the total and we also need to show the block number if we have that and then it seems to have lost the ability to edit or remove here.
So if we want to remove an entry, we want to be able to do that too. So let&#39;s go in here select So I&#39;m not sure why I can&#39;t add that there Maybe it&#39;s because this is closed.
Hooray! Okay, so to summarize here, it&#39;s going to be the removing this open here and then only showing the total slots and then we&#39;re going to hide the rank.
We also want to be able to remove from the list from this page by having an action column. So if we&#39;re going to put the action column on the right side, it&#39;d be good for us.
To have the dragon drop be on the left side so that they&#39;re not accidentally clicking both of them.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4c7cc8ee86714347af70d8d4ced46ebb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Improving Document for Training and Client Communication</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so this document is great and it&#39;s something that we can use for training internally and share with clients.
There&#39;s one more change that we want to do here is to make it more concise and also the language, see if we can make it simpler and easier to read.
Because when it comes to something like this, software descriptions, it can be overwhelming if you&#39;re looking at a lot. On a text like this.
So here&#39;s what I wanted to try. So if we take each of these sentences, or we can, you can try using the whole row at a time.
So if we do. I was trying a couple of different prompts. So we do this. Let&#39;s see. So, let&#39;s see.
So we can deliver the same message. So we can go back to this and edit it.

So the first one is the competency page that&#39;s on the performance competency tab that is in the performance page.
This report brings all of the different competency averages together on one page that you could interact with and dig deeper into the data.
So first thing I did was I chose a wide day range from 2020 to 2024 for this demo user that we have here.
And then if we come down, I can turn on different settings and generate the report. And as we get to the bottom, you can see that competency performance is broken down into a hierarchy.
And this is the highest level. And then patient care has an average for the highest level. And then if you go deeper into that competency, we have sub-competencies in here.
So the same thing applies for EPO&#39;s. So the hierarchies recreated based on the school&#39;s data. And then it&#39;ll have averages.
And if you go into the sub-competency, it&#39;ll have averages for those. And then each question that it&#39;s mapped to that sub-competency, we have averages for those questions.
And this continues into each of those core competencies in sub-competencies. And as we get to the bottom, we will have comments that were added by the Evaluate source.
There is also a competency committee report that we provide in the second page. And on this, you can select a day range, choose the different components of the competency committee report, and then select the user.
This report has schedules at the top that controls all of the clinical rotations that were submitted that were completed by the trainee, the competency performance with the averages, any attendance records, case logs that were entered in that day range, exam scores, and comments that were submitted
during that day range. Then we have the puller graphs with the competency graphs, and we select a day range, and then metrics will create separate charts for each of the core competencies and sub-competencies and again, we call it incompetencies, but it for each of the schools, if they&#39;re using EPO&#39;s
milestones, objectives, the data structure is going to be the same, it&#39;s going to show the averages based on what was collected on the evaluations.
There&#39;s also a scatter plot that gets generated, that shows the data over a period of time and how it is spread across the different responses, and then there&#39;s also a reviews page where it&#39;s a mentor or director, it can look at each of the students&#39; performance and then submit a review if needed.
Those are the reports that are on the performance page, in addition to those reports on the evaluations reports page, we have the evaluation summary report.
This report can also be used to see performance data, although it doesn&#39;t map, competency averages, but still we can come in here, select a day range, choose one of the forms, and then see how we want to group that data and then run it.
If I group the data differently, the averages will be adjusted based on the grouping, but I did in group the data and group this response here, and it&#39;s simply averaging based on the question, choose the total responses, percentage, and the response mean.
And for comments, I also have a way to search inside of the comments that we&#39;re submitted and find what I find.
So it&#39;s simply a way to select the submissions, see the averages, see all the comments, and then export that into PDF.
On the evaluation reports page, we also have a subcompensy report. If I choose this with the same date range that we have selected earlier, I can choose a role.
We&#39;re looking at the metrics subcompensy report. This is exported in Excel format, and it contains evaluation data or competency data for multiple trainees in the program.
So if you run this for a large number of trainees, it can be emailed to you after it&#39;s generated, and it may take some time to pull all the data together.
Essentially what it has is all the trainees listed on the left side, and along the top, we have the different subcompensies.
And each of those subcompensies have an average, and this data is getting pulled from those evaluation averages, and they&#39;re rolled into those subcompensy averages, and then we have a summary here.
And this report has two sheets. The first sheet has these average, average for every subcompensy for the entire date range.
And in the second detailed view, we have the separate roll for every subcompensy. So you can see here, this is a user, and we have the subcompensy.
And for each subcompensy, we&#39;re showing how many times this trainee was evaluated on the subcompensy, the average for that subcompensy, the peer number of evaluations, and the peer average.
With this data, it&#39;s a administrator or director or dean can look at it and make a decision on whether or not there was sufficient number of sampling over that period of time.
So if you, for example, if you have a competency, that was only assessed one time, then that may not be enough data to make a decision on whether or not the trainee is competent.
And if you have more confidence that the individual is competent or not competent in that competency or EPL. So first sheet will give you the summary, the second sheet will give you the number of times the trainee was evaluated.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b5f6a370f6da4ef3a65ca94dabbd73c5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Institutional Work Hour Compliance &amp; Summary Reports</pre></td><td><pre>Video we&#39;re going to take a look at the compliance report and the institutional report for work hours. These reports can be accessed from the institutional portal under reports page and under the work hours section.
So if we can scroll down to the compliance report we can and then click select criteria. I can select a date range, select the programs that I want to include.
These are the different training programs. That may be logging hours, and the roles that I want to include. And then once I select that, I also have the option to include users that are inactive, for example, any alumni.
Once I click download, this will generate an Excel file that includes a list of all the residents and the hours that they logged during that day range.
It will also include the following information includes the role, the primary primary program, the compliance percentage, and list of all of the days that they missed, as well as the overall program compliance for that specialty.
So if I&#39;m dealing with an internal medicine program, it&#39;ll show the compliance for internal medicine. The key thing to note here about this report is is that it factors in whether or not the sampling period is enabled.
So if the sampling period is enabled and you have defined specific sampling periods where the residents have to log hours, then the compliance percentage will only include those days in the denial So, if you have, we have a 30-day period that there&#39;s supposed to log hours and they only log 15 days out
of those 30 days, then it&#39;s considered 50%. On the other hand, if there is no sampling period defined, then it will look at the entire year and use that.
As a denominator, the total number of days in the year and then number of days that they log for that range.
That&#39;s if you&#39;re choosing the entire year. If you choose a specific date range, it&#39;ll use the number of days in that date range and you have the denominator and the number of days that were logged.
As a numerator. That&#39;s how this compliance percentage is calculated. The second report we&#39;re going to review is the institutional report which can be run on the same reports page and when you select the criteria for institutional report, we have the same filters that we can choose, the start date and
date, or the from and to date, the programs filters, the roles filter, and an option to include inactive users. When I click download, it&#39;ll generate a spreadsheet that includes a list of all of the programs, whether they require logs on weekends, whether compliance email are enabled as well as the
total number of trainees, total number of days without logs, the percentage that they logged, total hours that were logged. Average hours per week, total days off, not including weekends, total, and then a count of all of the violations that occurred.
And this is all being summarized for the date range that we selected. So those are the two reports that we can run on the institutional level to see the performance of our organization and see a bird&#39;s eye view into compliance as well as.
Violations that have occurred at the organization.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fafe32df33ae453db937ad273b3bc76c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Form Assignments in the New System</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jin. I&#39;m looking at these forms and I am noticing that these new 2023 and Intern form and 2023 2024 resident forms Both have assignments already and I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s for the first block So this is where we typically change this from a rotation form to a program form type and it doesn&#39;t allow those
form types to be changed to once there are assignments There may be a way for us to change that on our rent.
I&#39;ll have to look into that and follow up. Before we do that, I want to make sure that I understand your goals here.
Are you looking to have this form assigned? I understand your goals here. Are you looking to have this form assigned?
It&#39;s not a text to match the evaluations. If we use a program eval, it&#39;s simply going to use the roles and roles of groups to match forms.
So if you say supervising physicians and core faculty members evaluate PGY1s, then it&#39;ll take all the PA, supervising physicians and core faculty members and assign a form to have them evaluate the PGY1s.
So I&#39;d like to know a little bit more about what you&#39;re trying to accomplish and then I&#39;m open to having a call and discuss this because I want to make sure that if we make any changes, it&#39;s not going to cause any issues with, who gets the, yeah, who gets the assignment.
And yeah, so if, so the two things that we have to figure out is, are you trying to keep the context?
You know, do you need to know when the rotation was assigned and if so the rotation form, is what we have to use.
And then if you&#39;re trying to assign on a specific date, the rotation template doesn&#39;t allow you to do that. And the reason that we used to have that functionality and it&#39;s, we disabled it because the rotations change each month.
And if it&#39;s on a specific date, then it&#39;s going to assign on a specific date and it&#39;s not going to be used.
And you&#39;re going to be you&#39;re going to have to set up multiple rules to make that work. So,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/aac19398d2404d85a2add0ff8544f109</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Reporting for Work Hour Logs &amp; Violations</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at the different reports that are available for administrators that are working with work hours.
First, we&#39;ll take a look at the program administration portal. We&#39;re going to have an administration portal if we go to work hours, logs.
There are going to be four tabs here. First tab is by rotation, by month, by logs, and by people. Each of these tabs will give us different information about the logs that were entered into metrics.
So, on the By Rotation page, it allows us to see information about the logs that we&#39;re seeing. Actually all of the logs that were submitted by residents or fellows for specific rotations.
So if I scroll down, I&#39;m going to see a couple of things at the top. One is a legend, which allows us to see what types of violations or different color codes that we&#39;re using on the page.
And then once we get down further, we see the number of residents that we have on this program. And then a way to select a specific month, for example, right now we&#39;re in.
August, but if I want to go to the previous month, I can use the previous month button, or I can use the next month to go to the next month.
And as we scroll down further, we start seeing each of the residents list it out. And for each resident, I&#39;ll see the rotations that they work during that month and for each rotation I&#39;ll see all of the logs that they entered for that month.
So here I&#39;m looking at Robert Chase who was in dermatology and I can see all the hours hours that were logged for dermatology.
It gives me the total hours per day, the shift type, the little checkbox next to the shift type indicates that it was finalized and then if there was no log entered.
Then it&#39;ll say day off because the resident shows that option when they finalize the hours that they did not work that day, then the red no log tax indicates that no logs have an enter for a specific day.
And as we scroll down we can go see all of the residents that we have in the system. If no entries have been made, you won&#39;t see any hours log.
If I go to the previous month, it&#39;ll show me all of the logs that were entered for the resident for that the previous month.
So here Robert Chase again have logs for different days and he also has a violation that occurred that shows the violation details.
Along with the comments that he put in for that particular violation. So we&#39;re presenting the information all in one place.
The rotation details, the hours they logged, as well as the violation, and the comments that the rest of the time. So that&#39;s the first tab, the by rotation tab.
Next we have the by month tab. On the by month tab, it allows us to select a resident and then I can simply see the logs that they entered.
By month. And on here, it would show hours. And whether they have been finalized and whether if there&#39;s a violation it&#39;ll list out the violation and whether that violation have been commented on.
Next we have the by logs page. The by logs page allows us to select a date range, start by selecting the start date and end date, different work hour types or shift types, the roles, or specific individuals.
And then I can see the logs that they So, for example, I have all the log shot showing here for Robert Chase and this is showing everything that was entered for August and only Robert Chase has logged his hours.
And this table at the bottom will show name of the person, the hours, the entered, the site that they entered in, what they were working at, the rotation that they were working in, and any comments that they entered while they loved the hours.
I can also search this logs page. Using the search bar. There&#39;s a way to export this into a PDF or an Excel directly from this page.
Next we&#39;ll take a look at the Buy People tab. This has the same filters at the top with the start date and end date, work hour types, roles or people, and then on the bottom where we have the date of showing, it gives us totals for each person.
So it&#39;s going to tell me that Robert Chase Chased log hours of regular shift for 16 hours and then what the total hours were so this by people page is showing us total hours by each shift types and then by logs is giving us each of the logs that they have entered.
So under the program administration portal, we are seeing all this data for the residents or fellows that are part of this program.
If I go to the institutional portal, and the logs page, I am seeing all of the same information for the entire organization.
Here I can filter by program and select specific. To make programs and their residents, or I can see all residents in my organization.
So that&#39;s the difference on the institutional level for institutional administrators. They&#39;re able to see the work hour logs for the entire organization, for the program portal.
You can only see hours for the program. Next, we&#39;ll take a look at the second reporting option that we have, which is the violations reports.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/acab9b1922064b808bdd1dd8a7e226d9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Medtrics Competency Reports</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at the different competency reports that are available in metrics. So the first one is the competency page that&#39;s on the performance, competency tab that is on the performance.
Page. This report brings all of the different competency averages together on one page that you could interact with and dig deeper into the data.
So first thing I did was I chose a wide date range from 2020 to 2024 for this demo user. So I can go to the data center that we have here and then if we come down, I can turn on different settings and generate the report.
And as we get to the bottom, you can see that competency performance is broken down into a hierarchy and this is the highest.
And then patient care has an average for the highest level. And then if you go deeper into that, that competency, we have sub competencies in here.
So the same thing applies for EPOs. So the hierarchy is recre- ied based on the school&#39;s data. And then it&#39;ll have averages.
And if you go into the sub competency, it&#39;ll have averages for those. And then each question that it&#39;s mapped to that sub competency, we have averages for those questions.
And this- continues into each of those core competencies and sub competencies. And as we get to the bottom, we will have comments.
That were added by the evaluators. There is also a competency committee report that we provide in the second page. And on this you can select a data.
A range choose the different components of the competency committee report and then select the user. This report has schedules at the top that shows all of the clinical.
The two presentations that were submitted and that were completed by the trainee. The competency performance with the averages. Any attendance records case logs that were entered during that day range exam scores and.
On events that were submitted during that date range. Then we have the polar graphs with the competency graphs and we select a date range.
And then metrics will create separate charts for each of the core competencies and subcompetencies. And again, this we call it competencies, but it for each of the schools, If they&#39;re using EPOs, milestones, objectives, the data structure.
Is going to be the same. It&#39;s going to show the averages based on what was collected on the evaluations. There&#39;s also a scatter plot.
That gets generated that shows the data. Or a period of time and how it is spread across the different responses.
And then there&#39;s also a reviews page where it&#39;s a mentor or. Director can look at each of the students performance and then submit a review if needed.
So those are the reports that are on the performance page. In addition to those reports. On the evaluations reports page, we have the evaluation summary report.
This report can also be used to see performance data. Although it doesn&#39;t map. It doesn&#39;t show the competencies, competency averages.
But still we can come in here, select a date range, choose one of the forms, and then see how we want to group that data.
And run it. So if I group the data differently, the averages will be adjusted based on the grouping. But I didn&#39;t group the data, group this response here, and it&#39;s simply averaging based on the question.
It shows you total responses, percentage, and the response mean. And for comments, I also have a way to search inside of the comments that were submitted and find what I need to find.
So it&#39;s simply a way to search inside of the comments. It&#39;s a way to select the submissions, see the averages, see all the comments, and then export that into a PDF.
On the evaluation reports page, we also have a subcompetency. If I choose this, with the same date range that we have selected earlier, I can choose a role.
We&#39;re
looking at the metrics sub-competency report. This is exported in Excel format and it contains evaluation data or competency data for multiple trainees in the program.
So if you run, this for a large number of trainees, it can be emailed to you after it&#39;s generated and it may take some time to pull all this data together.

the entire date range and in the second detailed view we have the a separate role for every sub-competency so you can see here this is a user and we have the sub-competency and for each sub-competency we&#39;re showing how many times this trainee was evaluated on this sub-competency the average for</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/802781802c27474393a620b7772fee1b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Work Hours for Residents &amp; Fellows</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at what the resident or fellow sees when they are logging work hours so we have logged in as a resident and first thing that we can see on the dashboard is a couple of sections related to work hours hours.
On the right side we have a log hours button and then if there was any violations that we need to review that will appear on the dashboard.
Right now we don&#39;t have anything to review so it doesn&#39;t show up. So now if we go to the work hours page on the left menu will be taken to the page where we can log work hours.
First, we&#39;ll look at it from a desktop view and then we&#39;ll look at it from a mobile view. So logging work hours and metrics requires a published schedule.
So if you have a resident that is trying to log hours and they get an error message that says there&#39;s no public schedule published schedule They may reach out to you.
The first thing to check is make sure the block schedule is published So if we go to work hours, I know that this resident has a work published Schedule so we&#39;ll take a look at the calendar So, on the calendar, we have a few options.
By default, it loads on the Week view. I can see this week. If I want to go to the previous week, I use the left arrow to go backwards, and I can go forward using the right arrow.
The today button. Allows me to go back to this week. Then there&#39;s also the month view, which allows me to go backwards and months.
To log hours, there are three ways that we can put hours on the calendar. First is using this drag and drop function at the top where I can select one of the shift types and you can see at the top that we have four shift types published.
This is showing the shift types that we selected on the admin portal that we want to make available to the residents.
So I can drag and drop to the calendar. And you can see that this shift popped up, and this regular shift is what they will be using for the day shifts.
And that&#39;s going to be the most commonly used shift type where they work in a regular day shift from 8 a.m.
To whatever time they&#39;re finishing. That&#39;s the first. So the dragon drop is the first way to log hours. The second way that we can log hours is simply to click into the calendar and then this will bring up a window where I can select the date, which is going to preload to the date that I clicked into
. Then I can select the shift type, and it&#39;ll show me the same shift type at the top. And select the star time, select the end day.
So if you&#39;re working by default, it&#39;s going to say same day, that means that You&#39;re working your start time and end time is in the same day But if you&#39;re working if the resident is working an overnight shift, you would want to select the next day and that allow you to select a time that is in the next
day, so shift type Start time and day and then the end time are the required fields and then we have the comment field Which allows us to make a note if we want to Although at the top of this window, there is also a button called copy last shift.
This allows you to copy your all the all the options from the previous shift and so that you can repeat it so we have select we have two ways that we reviewed on how to log hours and the third way is to use this create button at the top.
This will bring up the same window that we were looking at and where you can enter all the information necessary to log that shift.
And a quick tip here is that if you have logged hours for a day and the next day, day you work in the same shift you can simply go back to the calendar, hover over the hover over that shift and then click the little repeat button.
To repeat the same hours to the next day. It simply will copy, copy the shift from one day to the next.
It&#39;s a one click. Copy let&#39;s do that from a previous page here so I&#39;m going to copy this regular shift here and I&#39;m going to move that that to the right place.
And then I can click to copy this from one day to the next. And then, The next thing that we can do is also use the drag functionality to adjust the hours as needed.
So I can move things around, I can increase the size, decrease the size as needed. To adjust the shift type.
Sometimes the system will also provide a warning when you&#39;re logging hours if there&#39;s going to be a violation. So for example, I received a notification that if I log this shift type, it&#39;ll cross an eight-hour off-filation.
So you want to make sure this is warning you in case you are entering something incorrectly, incorrect it before you finalize it.
So now that we&#39;ve reviewed how to log hours on the desktop, let&#39;s take a look at at what it looks like from the mobile.
So if you look at the mobile page, It gives you a different interface by default it&#39;ll arrive on today&#39;s date and you have the one-day visible and then here I can get I can click that create button to bring up the same window and log hours.
And I can also use the copy button if I need to copy one shift to the next day. Actually, I&#39;m sorry, when it comes to logging hours on the mobile, it actually takes you to a table view, so I can see the log, and I can see the list of log shifts, and each of them will have an edit, repeat.
Delete option and when I click on the edit I can edit the day and then adjust their time. If I want to add a new shift, I click on add shift and it&#39;ll bring up the same window here that we were looking at the desktop and that will allow us to log the hours for create a new shift.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2b3740e70f384ac084f83413d131a410</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Design Review: Consistency and Simplicity [🎥]</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Ericsson. So I want you to take a look at the original design and see if we can stick to a similar format because I think, keeping it consistent and simple like this is going to be better for delivering the content because, so for example, when it comes to the header, the cover page some of
the key elements here is the title the contact information, how long the client has been around and then the logo and that, and then if we go to the second page, this left side here allows people to learn product or by the case study.
So one of the things you can do is go into so this is the draft here. And I take this, go to chat.
Dt. Actually let&#39;s do this, let&#39;s do this other one. Say this is a draft of a case study, and we can say, We can take that.
And put this in here. Let&#39;s see if we can do something else. This transcript could include filler words which are transcribed when they appear as a part of the transcript.
And we always have to make sure the alignment is good. And here. So, I&#39;m not sure if we had stats.
So, if we had any, I think there was a completion percentage that was added. So we can talk about that later.
And then here, when it comes to the text, one of the things that is important for us to make it readable.
Is the use of white space and also when text is broken up. So like when a text is broken up into columns like this.
It makes it harder for users to read it. The reason why is you have to keep going from line to back and forth back and forth.
But if we use it as the full page, it&#39;s easier for users to read it and also. The justified text where there&#39;s uneven spacing between them also makes it harder for a person to read it.
It looks better, but it&#39;s not good for the reader. So, what we. Want to do is make it left justified also the spacing between the thing.
So, for example, if it&#39;s. This is size 12 font. The spacing between them is 16. So it gives it a little bit more breathing room.
So it makes it more visually appealing. And then same thing here. This some white space. Having a sub header. So we can do this.
Take this. Create a I look for this So here take this. Copy. So create a title for that. And we can do that for all of them.
So like, so this makes it the challenge and then the orange text makes. Stand out. And then for you can see the quotes using.
This gray or some sort of bar to emphasize the quote and then having the ball. And then I guess I&#39;m right about which is Slack or different refers.
So this is the theiu that Kyle Madagotzzi notes right here as well. Kyle really makes it visually more engaging. And then I also, I&#39;m a fan of using this 3333 instead of black.
So that it&#39;s, it&#39;s a slightly different. Variation on the, on the, on the black color. So I&#39;ll share this with you and you can make a copy and I think it&#39;s, it&#39;s good to try.
To create this in Figma is it&#39;s, it&#39;s an easy tool to learn since you already know since you already know illustrator and all of the editing tools are.
On the web and and it&#39;s going to be easier for us to go back and forth on feedback also.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0f6715754fef403e93c65c8d41550d93</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Competency Reports in Metrics</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at the different competency reports that are available in metrics. So the first one is the competency page that&#39;s on the performance, competency tab that is on the performance.
Page. This report brings all of the different competency averages together on one page that you could interact with and dig deeper into the data.
So first thing I did was I chose a wide date range from 2020 to 2024 for this demo user. So I can go to the data center that we have here and then if we come down, I can turn on different settings and generate the report.
And as we get to the bottom, you can see that competency performance is broken down into a hierarchy and this is the highest.
And then patient care has an average for the highest level. And then if you go deeper into that, that competency, we have sub competencies in here.
So the same thing applies for EPOs. So the hierarchy is recre- ied based on the school&#39;s data. And then it&#39;ll have averages.
And if you go into the sub competency, it&#39;ll have averages for those. And then each question that it&#39;s mapped to that sub competency, we have averages for those questions.
And this- continues into each of those core competencies and sub competencies. And as we get to the bottom, we will have comments.
That were added by the evaluators. There is also a competency committee report that we provide in the second page. And on this you can select a data.
A range choose the different components of the competency committee report and then select the user. This report has schedules at the top that shows all of the clinical.
The two presentations that were submitted and that were completed by the trainee. The competency performance with the averages. Any attendance records case logs that were entered during that day range exam scores and.
On events that were submitted during that date range. Then we have the polar graphs with the competency graphs and we select a date range.
And then metrics will create separate charts for each of the core competencies and subcompetencies. And again, this we call it competencies, but it for each of the schools, If they&#39;re using EPOs, milestones, objectives, the data structure.
Is going to be the same. It&#39;s going to show the averages based on what was collected on the evaluations. There&#39;s also a scatter plot.
That gets generated that shows the data. Or a period of time and how it is spread across the different responses.
And then there&#39;s also a reviews page where it&#39;s a mentor or. Director can look at each of the students performance and then submit a review if needed.
So those are the reports that are on the performance page. In addition to those reports. On the evaluations reports page, we have the evaluation summary report.
This report can also be used to see performance data. Although it doesn&#39;t map. It doesn&#39;t show the competencies, competency averages.
But still we can come in here, select a date range, choose one of the forms, and then see how we want to group that data.
And run it. So if I group the data differently, the averages will be adjusted based on the grouping. But I didn&#39;t group the data, group this response here, and it&#39;s simply averaging based on the question.
It shows you total responses, percentage, and the response mean. And for comments, I also have a way to search inside of the comments that were submitted and find what I need to find.
So it&#39;s simply a way to search inside of the comments. It&#39;s a way to select the submissions, see the averages, see all the comments, and then export that into a PDF.
On the evaluation reports page, we also have a subcompetency. If I choose this, with the same date range that we have selected earlier, I can choose a role.
And what this report does is it will create a spreadsheet with averages. For each student or each trainee that is part of the program.
The benefit of the subcompetency Excel report is that it&#39;ll show averages. For the entire class as opposed to the performance page report.
It&#39;s look you&#39;re looking at each student one at a time. So since this is going for. Multiple students may take some time.
So let me open this up. And we can see here. There&#39;s Multiple students may take some time. So let me open this up.
And we can see here. There&#39;s a lot of averages for each of the competencies or sub-competencies in our training program.
So you can see PC1, what are the averages, PC2, and this is showing it for the entire student body. On the details page, it&#39;ll show you all of the different evaluation responses, that lets those averages.
So it shows you for each sub-competency, number of times it was evaluated, what the average was, and the number of times the peers are evaluated, and the average was for the peers.
So this report is meant to be looking at all of the students while the competency report is not listed. So the performance page is meant for individual trainees.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/32269da9773643b6a2a457b5b42840c0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Competency Reports in Metrics</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon. In this video we&#39;re going to take a look at the competency reports in metrics. So on the performance page if we look at the tabs, the second tab here is competencies and this report is meant to bring all of the data that a trainee has accumulated over a period period of time and it groups
the results into competencies or milestones or whatever EPOs or objectives that the school&#39;s using essentially regardless of what type of competency structure you&#39;re using, it will group that data and show the averages for those competencies across the date rings that you
chose. So for example, here I&#39;m looking at four years of data for this trainee from all of the evaluation form.
And then I generate the report and I come down here and here we have the highest level which is patient care.
And if I expand that and I&#39;ll see the second li- level of the hierarchy and then all of the different con- questions that are associated with that, the responses are received and then I can see averages for each level of the competency.
So, question averages gets rolled up into the competency averages and then goes rolled up further into the core competencies. So, same thing if we&#39;re using EPOs, the different levels of the hierarchy will.
You&#39;ll get averaged together and you can see how the training performed. This chart here is showing data over time and I can turn on or turn things off.
If I want to focus on a specific competency or EPO and then as we go further down into the page, we also have a section for questions that were not mapped to the competency or EPO and then all of it at the bottom we also have comments that were written out by the evaluators.
The second chart here is for our competency reports, which I&#39;ll send a sample with this email. I can&#39;t show it on the screen because of the because it&#39;s, it&#39;s a PDF report, but it shows all of the rotations that the trainee completed if they&#39;re, if this is related to a clinical
rotations. And then it also shows averages for each of the competencies compared to their peer. The competency graphs then shows the same data as polar.
And it compares the student to their peers. So it&#39;s breaking it down by all of the different competencies and the sub competencies.
So in this particular exam, for example, we&#39;re looking at competencies, but if you want to, if a school&#39;s using EPOs like Yale&#39;s using it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2063a70397ca40bb8dd7c51b5cffd6c9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Analyzing Growth and Financial Data 📊</pre></td><td><pre>So what I did was I started a Google document for us to do some reporting on our growth and I gave you access to QuickBooks.
This document has a column 2014, 2015. 2016 and so on. Let me do something here. You can kind of see,um...so mer,emerging these together, and then you can see that 2014 was a total subscription and total services from a client.
And if I look in QuickBooks and I go to customers and I open up, let&#39;s say, one of our customers, ultimate and you&#39;ll see here 2019 invoice anything that is paid so what we want to do is, for 2019 what is the total that was paid we may be able to do a report, for this let&#39;s see sales by customer detail
and if I do hmm tilt you can see that group by month here. In cash air hose let&#39;s see, cost of air.
Class. Okay, so this report should have everything that we need. And what we&#39;re doing here is. Turning this into a summary report.
So I&#39;m going to export this to Excel. And I&#39;m going to load this. Here. I saw way way. We&#39;ll do format data filter views, create new filter.
And then what we want to do is filter by each of the clients in here. So let&#39;s say ultimate again, clear.
And you can see the product and service. Only 5000 plus 2500 is going to be the subscription. And also added notes here.
So we&#39;ll have. Total subscription. It&#39;s going to be. 7500. So that was in 2019. So what I want you to start by is create for each year three columns.
So it&#39;s going to be. Resist for each year three columns for each year three columns. I&#39;m alternating the colored columns.
With white columns, so it&#39;s easy to track. So 2019 total subscription for alt. The med was and if I hundred, then if we look at here for 2019 total services is We had.
$1,500.00. Actually what we can do is put in the, Let&#39;s start with getting the numbers. We&#39;ll get 2,500, 1,500. And then if we go back to here, 2021, we had, an increase here.
9,985. There&#39;s this friction. If we highlight all these, these are all subscription is $12,495. Then total services. So, this for example is a little tricky because we have two payments that is coming in on the same year.
And it&#39;s because 2020 was invoiced late. And they paid late. So this actually here and in the notes paid in 2021.
And then 2021 invoice was at the end of the year. And that was the, this, this, this, which is 12,870.
And you can see I&#39;m looking at, I&#39;m highlighting these three and it gives me the sum at the bottom. And then the next year we have this, this, and this.
13, 263. 25. So you can see. It&#39;s a big project but it&#39;s an important project for us to do some tracking on how we have grown over the years.
So we have ultimate starting in 2019, then we can see. How much they have grown from one thing to the next.
So what we want, we need to do this for each of our clients. This, once I&#39;ve done one client, I can go in here, remove this, and then, Choose another client.
And then we go from the beginning to the end.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/579aa6ac0d8f48799337e4a8a920ff0a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Evaluation Types and Dates in our Program</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, Jen. So for sending out evaluations on a specific date, you can do that using our program evaluation type.
And the general surveys also support adding a specific date. So the difference between the rotation evaluation and the program evaluation is that the rotation evaluations will use the schedules to assign those forms.
And for program evaluations, a resident can evaluate the faculty member or the faculty member can evaluate the resident and it&#39;s assigned on one or more specific dates.
So if I were to make informed here, let&#39;s say this is a resident. Valuation has all of the options that the rotation form has in terms of confidentiality.
Continue. I can add questions. And when I get to the last page. There&#39;s going to be a section when this.
Should this be automatically assigned? And if I choose yes. Here I can choose specific dates. So this is a button that allows us to add multiple dates.
And then once this is saved. On each of these dates, you&#39;ll have a copy of this form assigned. And then the email will go out to the appropriate evaluator.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f7f918fe9bee43598776b2804071035b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adding Resources to the Customer Dashboard</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Maria, so this customer dashboard, I added this second sheet here and this is pulling in the list of customers from the first sheet and what we want to add here is some resources that allow us to find information quickly.

And then here I&#39;m wondering if we can add a URL to, to front that will have filtered. So let&#39;s say from, And if we use that, yeah, so if we do that, then it would pull in all the conversations from that customer.
So that way. So this is going to be, But you have a new report that we&#39;re using for the ability of users, meaning does a user count towards their, light, the level licenses.
And this report includes, ,data on all of the users with and within a certain date range, it&#39;ll show you how many records were created by those users.
So, ,this would typically create a new column that adds up the values of each of these, each of these columns.
And if that number is greater than one, then it means that they use the system and they&#39;re billable. But for the customer success, ,stamp point, we can, we may be able to use that to see how many, like the higher the number, the more the system is being used.
So I&#39;d like you to take a look at this report and, you know, I don&#39;t want to do anything crazy in terms of putting it in.
I don&#39;t want to do anything to any power BI or anything like that yet. But I&#39;d like you to do this, think about like the data that&#39;s on here and brainstorm ideas on how we may be able to use this to make decisions on engagement.

I hope you&#39;re doing well and that you&#39;re off this long weekend and not on call. I wanted to share a short video updating you on a couple things that we changed in the system based on our previous discussions.
For example, the CCC report we had talked about the field and then being able to select multiple residents one after another without downloading the same report again.
To avoid that error, we had switched the type of field we&#39;re using here and instead of radio buttons, the administrators will be able to now search for a resident and select that individual to download the PDF and when the next time they&#39;re selecting another person, they can start typing and finding
a, finding the next person and, you know, we&#39;re also working on a way to select multiple residents to have that PDF email, or the setup PDFs emailed to the administrator.
That&#39;s something that is not done yet. Once that is released, it&#39;ll allow the coordinators to export reports. For all residents in the program, and have a set of PDFs sent to their email.
But right now, we switched out the field to avoid any issues in the future. Another update that I wanted to share was related to that forms.

You can access it by going to Claude.ai.
It&#39;s similar to ChatGPT and their new version is supposed to be pretty robust. ChatGPT is still better in some ways.
One of the advantages of this tool is that it supports attachments and large amounts of text. So, one of the things that I try to do here is I downloaded two PDFs.
The first one is a research file. Research article. So, if I go into here. You&#39;ll see this PDF here. It&#39;s a research on virtual reality and augmented reality.
And another one is a article from facebook. Engage substantial res UX as I did was I so one is a, a business article.
Another one is a academic research article. And I took both articles and I. Attached it here and I gave it a prompt that says I&#39;m attaching two PDFs.
The one is a research article. The second is blah, blah, blah, whatever topic it is. Read both articles and create an outline post and.
It used the text in those articles to compile. A blog article for me and I also asked to include citations.
And one of the in a second version, I also went as far as saying only use information, learn from these two PDFs to create the outline.
Do not make up content. So this limits the AI from creating fake information and then it helps me create an article.
So we can do this with multiple articles. So let&#39;s say we have a topic and we find. A bunch of different articles from different with different perspectives.
We can attach each of those here and then ask it to use that information to craft a new article. So it&#39;s really powerful for us to.
And combine information from different sources and it&#39;s pretty much mimicking what a human researcher would do. So that&#39;s one thing here.
Another thing I did. Here was I went on Slack and, And went to customer stories and I saved a few of their case studies here as PDFs.
And then attached those PDFs here. And I also saved the transcript for our discussion with Joe. And then I said, I&#39;m attaching three case study samples, text file contains a transcript.
And then. And I told the AI to use the transcript to write a case study in the style of what slacks case studies are being done.
So, that&#39;s what it did here. So you can see that what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s writing those articles in the style of what slacks format is.
So, It&#39;s something to experiment with and, you know, none of these things are perfect, but you can see here it&#39;s started incorporating some stats here that we may want to use in our system, in our, in our article.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/80cc655d31dd4ea08edb8c39cde6edc4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Working on Lottery Functionality 🎲</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Marina.

from the students. And unfortunately this has been sort of stuck in limbo. And one of the challenges here is the student portal has never been completed.
So if I go to lottery here, I have this lottery that&#39;s enabled, select preferences. And when I click on this new preference button, nothing happens.
I&#39;m supposed to bring up a modal and let&#39;s see if I go to, Chris and I have been talking about a report, which I think it&#39;s working fine.
So we don&#39;t need to bother you with that. But this is. Something that Rio built a while ago. And you can see here, it&#39;s supposed to bring up this modal and then I can select a site, a rotation, and then pick which blocks that I want to include.
And then it&#39;s supposed to update this table where I can see what blocks I selected, and then I can change.
And then once the order of the preferences here by dragging and dropping up and down. And then once the students have And then once the students have added everything, the lottery is supposed to run.
So I&#39;m hoping that what you can do is work on this first part so that I can finish testing it.
And it&#39;s supposed to bring up this model to let me add add all the details. And this Figma file shows you what that looks like.

I found that it&#39;s not going to get all the inside that we need. So open one up and look through it and see what question can be formed from this and this AI tool can help with this.
So for example, somebody clicked how to, she needs to act.  to the admin portal. This is more of a user error and they didn&#39;t see the admin button at the top.
So, this is another one where they need to know how to use from the GMAC work out report. And if you want to try using the AI, here&#39;s what I did.
I selected all the text and I clicked in here and I used note because we don&#39;t want to accidentally send them a message.
I paste it in here and I use the prompt create a. Okay, if a few questions for our knowledge base from the conversation above, write a detailed and then there&#39;s this option called custom prompt and what it does is takes all of the time to see what happens.
How do I run work out GMI report? And there you go, this is a response. So you can take this and put it into a spreadsheet.
And I believe it would be good for us to create a new tag that&#39;s called like how to review it or something.
So once we take care of reviewing it. And creating a question out of it, then we could change the tag.
So we have a list that we&#39;re working down from. Otherwise, it&#39;s gonna be hard to know what we have completed or we haven&#39;t completed.
And you can this is something that can be split up. For example, if we do a bunch and then create a process by which someone else on the team like Alejandra can help with, then it might make it easier for this to be done over the next quarter.
And each of these needs to be reviewed and make- sure that it&#39;s meaningful questions and also later on we&#39;ll also review to make sure we already don&#39;t- we already- we haven&#39;t already done that.

Let me correct that while I saw it. Alright, so one of the more useful things here is there&#39;s the form that we use to collect information for sales and the different submissions that we have received.
It shows like a summary of those. We also have the SEO page. But for lay that more important. Worton is the editor.
So if I go to the editor page, it&#39;ll open up the web page and at the bottom, we&#39;re going to have a bar.
Worton is the editor page of the bar. That shows pages which shows a list of all the pages. And then we have collections which are sets of pages for different parts of the system.
So use cases for the use cases. Worton is the editor page of the bar. Worton is the editor page features for the features page, blog posts, author profiles, testimonials.
So testimonials, for example, is a set of collections that we have a widget for. And anytime there&#39;s a widget that is displayed on the page for testimonials, it&#39;ll cycle.
Through the testimonials. Then we have documents. These are the different articles that were download that are being downloaded blog posts.
. Forms. And then anything that is drafted, you can see there&#39;s a couple of unpublished changes. And looks like Lay was working on the case.
So, I&#39;m going to share this with you. And then if you have any questions, let me know. So, it&#39;s pretty straightforward once you get in here.

Shhhhh. So. I think we should simplify the number of images we have on here, like, like this top section we can remove and then have instead of having coursement.
Irls mentor and trainee separately, because there&#39;s no, there&#39;s no need to have this separate because course mentors is a specific thing for LMU.
What we want to do is keep it simple and personal portal. We&#39;re going to have for me and about me.
And for the for me, we&#39;re going to get rid of this whole section at the top. And it&#39;s going to be this whole section.
And then there&#39;s going to have, we&#39;re going to have a a filter at the top for whatever&#39;s incomplete and or pending and completed.
We can probably put those as two buttons here. Pending and completed and it&#39;ll show whatever they have to do on this page.
And then the completed if they click on it will show them whatever they have already completed. And the we&#39;re not going to have the archive button on this page.
When they click view, it&#39;ll open up in a separate page like we currently do. And we also don&#39;t need to show the last reviewed here.
Because we&#39;re going to do all the review stuff from the reviews tab. So essentially we&#39;re removing this section, have the pending and completed.
We&#39;re going to have this table at the top. Under pending and completed. We&#39;re going to get rid of archive. We&#39;re going to get rid of awaiting your review.
Anything to do with reviews. And then for the about me thing. It&#39;s. Going to be we can have two two buttons here also.
One is going to be anything. Actually, we talked about viewed by me. Yes. No. Instead of. Having it as dropdown, we can have it as new and viewed.
So it&#39;s going to be one button that says new evaluations. And then another one for. Viewed evaluations. So that way they can toggle it and see what they have any evaluation that we&#39;re done on them.
They&#39;ll be able to see it. If it&#39;s new on the new tab, a new button. And then if it&#39;s already looked at, it&#39;ll be under the viewed.
And same things here. We&#39;re going to get rid of the archive the review status. I mean options reviewed count. And.
We don&#39;t need to show this highlights here because all of them in this is going to be completed because there&#39;s somebody&#39;s completed that.
And we can also remove the archived. So that&#39;s going to be the simpler for me and about me. Both of them are going to be missing this top section.
It&#39;s going to missing the archive and it&#39;s going to be missing the. Review stuff and it&#39;ll have two buttons at the top one for pending for me and completed and then for about me it&#39;ll be new and viewed.
And then the last tab, the reviews tab is going to be the more complex one where we have all these filters at the top and the page looks like this.
For the review status, we&#39;re going to simplify that and saying. I&#39;m waiting review and then waiting review by me and then and then awaiting review by others.
With reviews, we can open it up in a modal like this, but for the about me and the for me, we&#39;re going to open it up in a new page like we currently do.
So if I go to the evaluation, this page pending valuations. So I need to have this submit as unable to assess PDF and delete for the for me.
So it&#39;ll have the, So we&#39;re keeping this filter, basically at the top that&#39;s showing all that it&#39;s pending and all that is completed.
I forgot about cancel and unable to assess. So maybe we should have this as, the drop down with the top instead of a button.
So this drop, this filter at the top and it&#39;ll show pending by default, but you can switch and do the other ones we want to.
And then we also need to show the same old, some of it as enabled to assess PDF and delete if it&#39;s a open evaluation.
And then the about me same concept here. You&#39;ll see the what&#39;s viewed and what&#39;s not. I still need to be viewed.
And this also needs to have the PDF. And then we&#39;re adding that viewed here. And for both both of these we had to open it up.
It should open up in a separate page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4235ffd02de34e0ebbb5f75a74759d9b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>All right for Tammy&#39;s call on Tuesday or Monday whenever that is happening There&#39;s a lot that we can cover there Tammy and And Tammy&#39;s program started with us when they were first Getting started with their residency program and they actually purchased metrics a year before they were actually accredited
for the sponsoring institution. And they, Tammy was the first coordinator. And then there was a DIO who&#39;s, who&#39;s the actual program director.
He played dual role in as a program director and the DIO because they only had one sponsoring institution with one program.
And Tammy had been recruited from another department. She had never worked in graduate medical education. So we were essentially working with her in the beginning to do a lot of teaching on some of the best practices.
And she relied heavily on Chris and I to learn about medical education. And we I actually drove out to Kentucky one for their training and I met Tammy.
And the program director and we let me see if I can find it. Not that one. We recorded a video testimonial at that time.
Unfortunately, that program director was left and it didn&#39;t. So it&#39;s not very impactful anymore because you went to a different institution.
But Tammy stayed there and she is essentially the person that is holding the program together. She even. Though she&#39;s a coordinator, she kind of been there since the beginning.
And then she has another coordinator that worked with her. Her name is Melody. Last year they contacted us to add on the student program.
So they have an internal medicine residency program and I. We talked to Tammy and they said they have about 100 medical students that are coming there each year.
And they wanted to centralize the data for the medical students, along with the residents. So we have both the residency program and the medical students using the same platform.
So this is a very unique story. They told me what are the benefits of using metrics for both the students and the residency in one platform?
And what are some of the things that they&#39;re using the data for? And why, for example, like retention, being able to try, to track the students from the beginning of their experience at the school and seeing if they can retain them as residents.
And then after they graduate, can they keep them as faculty members? So it&#39;d be interesting to get her perspective. She, Tammy is also a big fan of our support team and how we, are available to her when she needs it.
So we can definitely talk about that and her experience working with our onboarding and supporting process. And when it comes to the platform, she has seen other demos of systems and she always tells us how easy it is to use metrics.
So we can talk about that. And the thing that Tammy is also Tammy&#39;s also someone that is involved with other areas of the hospital because she has tried to connect us with the nursing program even though they decided not, they got a free platform, they
ended up using that. So it&#39;s something we can speak to the bigger impact that Metrix is having for the organization.
Let me take a look at some. So ascended. 6%, two-percent overdue evaluations. That is really good stats out of 3000 assignments, evaluations that are assigned.
So they&#39;re getting great data from the system. They&#39;re using all of our functionality. They&#39;re using the time off. They&#39;re using the announcement.
The upcoming events. So there&#39;s a lot that this institution is using, even though they&#39;re small. And I think it&#39;s also important to highlight the background of why ARH started this residency program, specifically like the program.
And so you know, I think it&#39;s also important to note that I think it&#39;s also important to note that we have a we have a board of directors that was involved with this in the beginning and Tammy&#39;s the one that worked with them.
So I think it&#39;s also an important point to highlight from a metric stamp, not necessarily metrics, but the organization.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4cd690b9e1444f9bcf67866812cc174</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sorting Users by Type 🎨</pre></td><td><pre>On a shift template, when they have different users being added here, we have different color codes that we use for roles.
The goal of this task is for us to sort these individuals. By type, user type. So all the residents will show up at the top, then students, then faculty, and then staff.
And we&#39;ll have, one color code, one color for each of the user types. So all the residents will same color, students same color, faculty same color, staff the same color.
And then we&#39;re gonna show the role next to each of their names. So it&#39;ll be Christopher and the role will be.
In parentheses.
Or instead of parentheses, we can just put dash and then italics, so less characters. Yeah, and that&#39;s it. So basically, color code by user type, put the user types together.
So it shows the residents at the top, students second, faculty, and then staff, and then Then it shows the residents at the top, students third, and then staff, and then staff, and rolls next to it with dash and roll with italics as a roll.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5a22a497197a46a1a0aa2fab3898ceeb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Update to Weekly Email Notification 📧</pre></td><td><pre>So this task is for us to update our email notification that goes out weekly. This login button at the top is confusing people and it doesn&#39;t because people click on it and it takes it to the login page.
They don&#39;t realize that. They need to click on these buttons down here. So what we want to do is get rid of this login button or move it all the way to the bottom and saying Although it&#39;s the bottom and saying if you need to access metrics.
If you need access metrics, you can use the button below to log in and then have the login button. This way they&#39;re not going here and running into trouble.
The other thing we can do is, under this pending evaluations, we can add a little subtitle with this type of font that says you can complete evaluations.
Click Respond. To complete evaluation. Actually, we don&#39;t need that. It&#39;s fine. As long as we get rid of this. And the other thing that clients how to work is a our email notification doesn&#39;t have anything about the institution name or program name so what we wanted to up update was I&#39;m thinking about
whether we, if we add the program name, whether it&#39;s going to be useful, but nothing that&#39;s going to help because program names are different for each of the institutions.
Yeah, let&#39;s tackle this for now.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a450e2d15be747ddb79e787599d5546c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Data Migration to Google Drive 📂</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Alejandra. So for this project, it&#39;s going to involve moving over some data from this sheet into Google Drive. What we need to do is on this page, you&#39;ll have all of our different milestones.
So I&#39;m going to go to Google Drive, shared folder, client onboarding, and there&#39;s going to be a page called assets.
And we&#39;re going to create a sub folder called competencies. And inside that I&#39;m going to create three folders, GME, UME.
So we&#39;re going to create a sub folder called competencies. Nursing, and before one more, Allied help. Then inside into these folders.
We&#39;re gonna have subfolders. So for example, this first, first one is actually going to be a zip file with multiple attachments in it.
So we&#39;re gonna have to open that up and break it up. Each one we want to save it as a CSV.
So for example, this one here, we&#39;re going to do is it&#39;s under GME. I&#39;m gonna go into GME new folder, save this name.
And then I&#39;ll download this file. And inside this folder, attach this file. So I do the same thing for all of these.
So we&#39;re gonna move this all over. And you can see that what folder is determined by the type, and then the name of the subfolder is going to be this name here.
For this one, let me open this up here. If you extract this folder, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s multiple files in here.
So these are all going to be GME files. And we&#39;re going to create subfolders for each. So those will all go into this subfolder.
So everything that&#39;s on this page, each of these will have separate files and separate folders, except this one at the top, which you had to download it and extract it.
And then that&#39;ll be a separate folder. And let me know if you come across any questions as you go through it.

First, the document categories are not showing up on this page.
Even though if I go in here, select a site, name, then choose this. Now, and let&#39;s go to, ccc. Report.
So it uploaded. And I forgot where I uploaded to. So there you go. And name. Document. The other thing that I&#39;m, we have an issue.
So this problem number one. Problem number two is when I click on it. And I can. Upload a new file when I upload a new file.
I&#39;m showing a different model here than when I&#39;m. This is the personal portal. This is a personal documents model. Instead of the institutional documents model, so it needs to be showing the institutional documents because this is showing categories that are for personal documents.
So that&#39;s one thing and then the. The other thing is both for the personal documents. And for institutional documents. We also need to add a delete button and yeah, so we need to delete the button.
We need to add a delete button so that it has a sweet alert that pops up says, are you sure you want to delete this document?
And then if they click yes, then it&#39;ll allow them to delete it. So one bug is the category I&#39;m showing.
Second is the model is incorrect for documents for site and program. And the third thing is we need to be able to delete documents from both both sheet.
Pages and the personal documents. I saw this something looks different here. So we have this button showing up on the options role under personal documents.
We don&#39;t have that. So we can use this. Same view as the other one so that you have an options role.
So this way the button&#39;s done not stack like this. So those are three issues on this page. A program document, let&#39;s try this too.
Let me do this one more time so I&#39;m going to use site. We should also clear. If I choose a site, we should clear the program.
Or if I choose a program, we should clear the sites. So that, I mean if it&#39;s easier to do, if it&#39;s not easy, don&#39;t worry about it.
Alright, so the description does show up at the bottom. That&#39;s good. Alright, so that&#39;s three bugs there. And then, let&#39;s go.
Go to system setup settings and here. All of these fields appear to be broken. All of these fields appear to be broken.
Thank you. So. I don&#39;t have a way to search. It will be very helpful also to figure out when this broke these fields.
There&#39;s a way for us to, because we haven&#39;t touched this page in a while. I want to, I want to know if there&#39;s a way for us to look back the code and see when it was modified because so that we can try to prevent it in the future.
Another thing. On this page for, so that was an institutional settings I showed earlier and for program settings. Same thing here, none of these fields of this is everywhere.
So something changed and all of these fields for program settings and institutional settings are broken. So we got to check every field where you can select a person to make sure that is correct on the institutional settings and program settings.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3a8b83a0362c484c82026da2da2b1176</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adding Administrator Approval for Credentialing 📝</pre></td><td><pre>So this functionality is for the case templates and what we want to do is add a way for administrators to approve when a resident has completed all of the requirements for their cases.
What we&#39;re going to do is add, under the enable field section, we&#39;ll add another checkbox that says require to call it require administrator approval for credentialing.
And if that&#39;s turned on, we&#39;ll, On the users page, if I open up a resident, under, cases, we have a way to mark the missed credential.
So what we want to do is add a new column that is called, credentialing approval and when it&#39;ll have a checkbox or a check button like this and you can click on it and it&#39;ll mark the, person as approved.
And if the case template has a requirement for administrative approval, we will not automatically show this credential date. Instead, it will only show the credential date once the administrator has clicked the second checkbox.
The first checkbox we can call instead of status we can call it minimums The first checkbox we can call instead of status we can call instead of status we can call it minimums and the second one will be administrator approved.
And the credentialing will be tied to the second button. On the CCC report, which is under the performance. Arment&#39;s page, For case logs, we have the case templates, log required completed.
I&#39;m going to add one more column that says approve. I mean now. Administrator approved. And then that will allow us to see which ones And then that will allow us to see which ones And then that will allow us to see which ones And then it will allow us to see which ones is have signed off on.
We also want to show the credentialed date. So it&#39;ll be approved and then I&#39;ll show the date that they, sorry, why don&#39;t we do this?
We&#39;ll call the column credentialed slash approved and if the administrator has It will show the date that it was approved.
If it was credentialed automatically, then it will show that there. It will show the date of the metrics automatically credentialed them.
It will show the date that it was approved. I&#39;m thinking through this. So essentially it&#39;ll be case type required, log completed, and then credential slash approved, and I&#39;ll have a date column there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/482628b6854f426491b963098e22ab06</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Issue with Editing Hours and Missing Alert</pre></td><td><pre>So it looks like when I&#39;m editing the hours here, let&#39;s say by add Something here.

So for example, if I adjust it here, it&#39;ll show me that warning. Cause eight-hour, double-check your entry. So if I create it using this, modal, it doesn&#39;t allow, it doesn&#39;t show me that alert.
I also think that we lost some CSS here. I believe these were meant to be little gray buttons. But it&#39;s a, It&#39;s not a big deal for now.
But one thing that I noticed is that, so there is no eight hour gap here. If I finalize this, Even though I was warned I&#39;ll get an eight hour violation, I&#39;m not getting that.
So, for some reason we lost that eight hour violation check here.

If a form has already been set up as a rotation evaluation, then to change that, we need to go to the Edit page, and then you can use this form type to update that to a program evaluation.
If the form has already been used and has assignments, then the form type cannot be changed since you already have data.
So in that scenario, you would need to make a copy of it, and then change the form type on the copy and deactivate the original evaluation template.
But if a form is is going to be collected using a QR code, that form has to be set up as an open evaluation.
So the first part is to, would be to, if you wanted to change it to a program type, you had to first change that to a program type.
And if it also needs to be an open evaluation with a QR code. You&#39;ll have to go to the Assignments page, go to the question number six, which is, should this form be available as an open evaluation?
And then you have the yes here. And this will enable the QR code. And now I can. And click on this QR code and go directly to that form.
And on that form, I&#39;ll be able to select a resident and complete this evaluation. If I don&#39;t want the attending to go straight to the form, instead I want them to see all the open evaluations in my program, this open evaluation QR code is the better one to This will allow the faculty member to see a
list of all the open evaluations in the program and then choose a form they want to complete. Each QR code that is linked to a template will take them directly to the form where they can select a resident and complete it.
The QR code at the top will take them to a page where they can see a list of all the open evaluation and they get to select one form and then select the resident.
One more thing that I want to highlight here is that residents should be encouraged to use this. This is a personal device, keep me logged in functionality so that if they&#39;re logging in from a smartphone.
Phone, they&#39;re going to be logged in automatically. This means that they don&#39;t have to keep entering their password.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7d50678834a3474e92b9994d639c9f71</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updates on CCC Report and Evaluation Forms 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Jin. I hope you&#39;re doing well and that you have a long weekend ahead and not on call. I wanted to take a couple of minutes here to update you on two releases that we had put out to the service this week.
One of them was related to that CCC report and updating the field that is available for the administrator to select a resident.
Instead of using that, the radio button fields, we have switched it to a dropdown which makes it. Easy for the administrator to see what resident they&#39;re working with.
And then if they need to switch to someone else, they can easily do that. This will avoid any issues with selecting the wrong resident or not clicking on a specific field and accidentally getting the same report again.
So. With this change we&#39;re also working on a way to select multiple residents in the future. And that project will allow the administrator or the coordinator to select all of the residents and have multiple PDFs, email to them.
This will save them time before the CCC meeting. And have everything in a one email instead of having to do it one at a time.
So that was one of the updates is a drop down and a second part that we&#39;re working on is the is being able to select multiple that&#39;s actively being worked.
And it&#39;ll be out in the near future. The second update that went out is related to creating evaluation forms. When we had spoke last time, we had gone over some usability issues on the questions page.
So when you&#39;re on this page, if you change the question type and then save it, it was in. And always retaining the fields, hmmm.
And updating to what you&#39;re selecting. So until you refresh the page. We have optimized this. So that it automatically refreshes that.
After you save the model. So let&#39;s go to here. And then dragging and dropping, I believe this was already resolved.
That was that was also something that was checked when we did the optimization. So make sure. That there&#39;s no issues with that.
Heh heh.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/769058dc703c42fea1cbb8ee6679e187</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Making Mobile Experience More Intuitive</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so this task is about how do we make the mobile experience more intuitive? And what I want to do is for us to look at what some of the other companies have done to make it for someone to add their app to the home page.
So when you get to the home page, when you get to the metrics page, we want to show something a pop-up like this.
That is customized to their device. So if they&#39;re coming from a Chrome, or Safari, they&#39;ll see an iPhone one. And if they come to the homepage from an Android, they&#39;ll see the Android version.
And And what we want to do is when you click the Add button, it&#39;ll bring up a window, a modal window.
And what we want to do is when you click the Add button, it&#39;ll bring up a modal window. That shows the instructions for adding it to the home page.
So for example, here. You can see this thing pops up and then it&#39;ll show me to select the Add to the Home Stream button and then I can rename it and then I have it on my home screen.
A little pop-up that comes up similar to this here that lets it with a button that says view instructions opens up a mo- gives you that gives you how to do that and once it&#39;s added to the homepage we don&#39;t show it anymore so it basically shows up and then We can at the bottom of it.
We can have a little checkbox that says Do not show this anymore and we&#39;ll store it in the database So that it won&#39;t show it to them any after they confirm that So this way we are encouraging people to Use a mobile and save it on their phone and also stay logged in.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/730706d68b2f49b6a8b035286521b5f1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updates on CCC Report and Evaluations Page 📝</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Jin. I hope you&#39;re doing well and that you&#39;re all for this long holiday weekend. I want to just spend a couple of minutes sharing updates with the two of the issues that we had discussed in our last call.
On the CCC report, we had talked about an issue where if a, coordinator is selecting a resident and then searching for another resident, they don&#39;t actually click on the second resident&#39;s name.
The system was generating the same PDF as the first resident they searched for. So to avoid that error going forward, We have switched out the type of field that we&#39;re using for selecting a user, so there&#39;s no mistakes in who you&#39;re picking in this dropdown.
And this is also, this is already released and we&#39;re also working on a second part of this that allows the core, coordinator to select multiple residents at a time and then have those PDFs email to them.
This way they don&#39;t have to do one resident at a time before the CCC meeting. So that&#39;s one of the updates.
A second one is related to the, evaluations and templates page. On the form builder under managed questions, we had gone over some issues where if you&#39;re, selecting a question and you&#39;re changing the question type and saving it, the page wasn&#39;t getting updated until you refresh the page.
So we have changed that, so any updates to the question will also get changed on the page immediately so that it doesn&#39;t create any confusion.
The drag and drop functionality was also checked at the same time to make sure that it&#39;s not impacted with this change.
The one, so both of these are updates have been released to the server and if you are making any changes in the future this will be something that you&#39;ll notice.
One piece that I found after our call and we started talking about it was related to the linking of the question and making changes to that.
And how it wasn&#39;t always showing what was linked when you&#39;re going there to edit this. I had also submitted a request to the dev team about addressing that scenario so that if a program director in the future is coming back.
And editing some of the existing links to the milestones to make sure that it&#39;s always shown. And that there&#39;s no extra clicks that are needed.
This is a third task that is still being worked on in the next week or so. That should also be addressed.
So hopefully that will make this whole process seamless for you or anybody else in the system that is working on updating existing forms.
So I also have, I had reached out to your chief residents and they mentioned that they have the help that they need for the basics of metrics from the existing chiefs or the other graduating chiefs.

And there&#39;s stuff regarding content writing. There&#39;s stuff from leadership, marketing, sales. So these are a lot of small articles and posts that has really good information.
And I saved a good ones that I came across. Some of them I copied and pasted into a document. Some of them I saved as a PDF.
What I&#39;m going to do is upload these to a Google Drive folder. And what I want to do is start going through them and incorporating some of these things into our process.
So for example, this first set of things that I have in here, it talks about four ways to build genuine connection.
Join early. Have two or three questions ready for an observation. Listen to them. Build report and gives you ideas of like Good things to use when you&#39;re trying to build report with someone So for example, a lot of people talk about the weather zoom issues, which is not a good topic Something that is
basic is not good, but if you have something that you found out about them from their profile, that&#39;s more valuable for a conversation.
So for this, what we can do is before if we, have a demo tomorrow, we can spend a little bit of time researching the person that we&#39;re meeting with, the organization, and come up with two to three questions that we can start the conversation with.
And that you can start the conversation with, and that is not necessarily about our product, but to build a relationship with them.
Then there&#39;s other sections here so you can read through it. Some of this is something I&#39;m going to have to work on, some of this which you&#39;re going to work on.
And this is little by little we can improve our process if we use these tips that others have shared. So what I&#39;d like you to do is read through these and then simply for each Section Section ideas that you can think of how we can incorporate that into our process.
So this one has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, eight, nine, eight, six, seven, eight sections. So, you can simply just put a, like under here.
Put a bold text and then type what you think are good ideas. And then you and I can discuss them and incorporate those ideas into our process.
And I&#39;ll also be uploading more content like this over time. You know, we&#39;ll do like one or two. Every couple of days and over this this way little by little our process is getting better</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1f991d11b3cc47e18a92a834d35bcdb9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 21 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>On the calendar page for the institutional portal, program admin portal, we&#39;re going to add a new button above the calendar.
Right here on the counter page right above the buttons for timeline week month and list view in between the two white sections here.
We&#39;re going to add a standard blue button that says, create event. And when they click on that button, it will bring up this event model to create the event.
That&#39;s the first update here. Second update is on the list view. We don&#39;t want this to be showing this blue background here because it&#39;s hard to read.
You should all see, shown as white background. And then we also want to show on this page the name of the speakers, If there&#39;s a speaker.
Selected and the internal speaker or the external speaker. So that&#39;s the second change. The third is a bug here. When I&#39;m selecting a date and going in here, put 130A.
Let&#39;s say I choose 11 a.m. To 12.30 p.m. Or let&#39;s put something incorrect. Here. It says enter date. If I choose a start time that is on the calendar event creation model.
If I create a start time that is after the end time. I get an error that says end time must be after the start time.
So this is a correct error, but the problem is that this save button is grayed out, even if I fix this problem.
It still won&#39;t let me save an event. So we should not gray out this save button. And so that the user can save it, fix the problem and save it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/16e49ec5840c4dff84489ffad9a2d112</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Bug with Email Notifications for Speakers 🐛</pre></td><td><pre>This is a bug that is happening with email notifications for speakers.

We also wanna update this text message. Text that says event QR code. The event QR code below can be used to log a text that says event QR code.
The event QR code below can be used to log a text that smart phone starting for tune-in minutes before the event, we can say the QR code below can be used to log attendance during the event.
You may put this on your presentation so that the attendees can scan it and log their attendance using their smartphone.
Attendance can be collected 15 minutes before the event till 15 minutes after the event. So we&#39;re gonna update the emails, include the QR code.

And when I click submit request, if the user selects the same start date and same end date, we want to show two additional fields.
Two different fields. One is start time and end time. And then if by default, it should be from midnight till 11.59 p.m.
So it&#39;s a full day. But the use users will be able to adjust that to whatever start time and end time they want.
If they select more than one day, so for example, if I choose June 15th to June 30th, then we won&#39;t show the start time and end time and it will be working exactly as it is right now.
You won&#39;t have any changes. The idea, the goal here is to give users the ability to select specific start time and end time if they are only logging one day.
If they&#39;re logging more than one day, they won&#39;t be able to select the start time and end time. And once it is saved on this page, we want to show request a dates shows when&#39;s the dates here.
If there&#39;s only one entry and it has a start time and end time, we want to show it as such.
So it will be Wednesday, September 1st, 2021. And then 8 a.m. Till 5 p.m. So it&#39;ll show the time here.
If there&#39;s multiple days being entered, it will, on the table view, it will not show the time. It&#39;ll simply show the dates and as it is working right now.
On the dashboard page for the personal portal and the program admin portal. On the time off section, we&#39;re going to show the same thing.
If it has a start time and end time and it&#39;s a single day entry, we will show it. If it&#39;s a multi-day entry, they will not.
Not be able to see this time. It&#39;ll just show the dates on the calendar view. If they, if they&#39;re looking at the calendar and it shows time off entries, if it&#39;s single day, we&#39;ll show the time off.
With the hours, if it&#39;s a multi-day entry, we&#39;re going to show the full start time and end time. Same on the block schedule page.
If I&#39;m, if I have a resident that is taking time off, then it will. I&#39;m going to show the time.
If it&#39;s a single day entry and if it&#39;s a multi-day entry, it&#39;ll simply show vacation or whatever the actual account is.
So you can see here, it says work related travel. November 28. Two December 1st. But if it was a single day entry, you would have shown November 28th, 8 a.m.
To 5 p.m. So to summarize, what we want to do is give users the ability to select a start time.
The time and end time if they are entering time off for one day. And on all of the pages where we show time off, we want to show this start time and end time if it is a single day entry for multi day entry.
We don&#39;t want to show that. The time only. The time of the day is this also applies to email notifications that are being sent from metrics.
So any email notifications that has the start the time off, if it&#39;s a single day entry, we&#39;ll still just show the start time and end time.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/aca3f78dadaf43e587f9283b160f1cdf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>This is a bug that&#39;s happening on the evaluations page 2. Evaluation templates page 2. So on the program admin portal, go to evaluations, templates, and then, open up any of the templates that are in the system that have competency mapping.
So on the demo server, it could be the cardiology and evaluation form. And on this page, if I open up a question.
Let&#39;s say if I click Edit question and then go to the Link question tab, you can see that even though the system is telling me there are three core competency links, when I go to the Link question.
Actually, so if I come to the page, go to link question, it doesn&#39;t show anything. But if I go and cancel out, of it come back in, then I see links here.
But I don&#39;t have a way to change this. If I clear it, then I&#39;m, I can&#39;t do anything. Thing. Let&#39;s go back in here.
But if I refresh it, click edit, then I don&#39;t see the links. But if I unclick, then I can change it.
So it&#39;s very buggy how this page works. What we need to do is make sure that if I&#39;m clicking edit question, go to link question, it should show what I&#39;ve selected and it should also allow me.
To change those options if I need to. So if I click here, go to link, if I go to, if I go to the page, it should let me add selection to the right side.
And then also if I want to remove something, I can unclick it, remove it. And then once I unclick it, the core competency sub, competencies of competency levels and milestones button should reappear and The best way to solve this is to apply a plug.
On this model that we have created for the question bank. So this uses a different view, different page selector. And We can take this model and apply this to the other page.

Thank you for taking the time to go back and forth about these issues. I wanted to make sure that we are planning out our future with the Talam in a way that it&#39;s fair and You users that we have in metrics that are not deactivated.
So in my previous email, I had mentioned that both Ross and AUC have over 8,000 active students. So, and many of them that were added.
This year. In our discussions from last year, from the email sequence that you had shared with us, from the conversations with David, it was brought up by David that was brought up by David.
When users are audited, if they are not deactivated, the numbers can be off. And as part of the initial discussion from what I&#39;m reading here, David D had also, ah, acknowledged that there&#39;s an issue with, users getting deactivated in metrics, and there may have been a problem with the integration
, but it was never corrected. And then, ah, David, and worked with you and Kevin McClaugh to come up with the process of totaling the numbers.
Without deactivating the users which is not entirely a true count of the users in the system, because a user can be added to the system and either did not have some some data added to, ah, meet the, so for example, if a user</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0293f713b24046bb8814f515c7e1c4ad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Update 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon Kevin. Thank you for taking the time to go through these issues and work through our concerns. I also appreciate you having a meeting with the team at TALM to plan out any changes for the future and we&#39;re okay with discussing that for next year.
But there are, there is one concern that we need to get resolved for this year and that&#39;s the fact that we have over 8,000 trainees in both ROS and AUC that are still active.
According to our SOW that we are working through metrics, ah, licenses are calculated based on this criteria here. Ah, each year the supplier will examine data on each server to determine the amount of unique student accounts utilizing any of the student modules.
So the user&#39;s module is something that is being used by anyone that is, ah, that is active. So that&#39;s really how we define a user in the system.
If they are act- if they have an active account and they can log in, That&#39;s- an active license. For historical data, if someone is a graduate and their account is made inactive, then that&#39;s being stored in metrics for historical data and it&#39;s not considered an active license.
Last year when the count was being determined, there was a conversation between David Capach and and you and the team there about inactive users.
Let me see. See if I can find it here. So initially the count was too high because there were users that were deactivated and.
There was a conversation about the API not working properly and banner statuses were not getting synced into the system. So those users were not deactivated and there was a plan to manually clean that up, but it was never done.
Instead the the report was used to calculate the numbers without looking at the active column. So what we need to do this year is fix that problem with the data so that we are, using that active status to, ah, determine if someone is a, ah, user in metrics.
So if we clean up the inactive users, the count still, should still be the same because only users that are enrolled at the university for the, past year should have an active status or have data that has been added into the system within the last year.
And if we look at metrics right now and select student users that has the active, active status, we have 8,523 users.
And these are students that can potentially log into the system. This needs to be corrected on all of the servers, mainly ROS and AUC.
So the active users are an accurate representation. Students that have been enrolled there. For any alumni that needs to have an MSPE generated, then they would also need a license since they&#39;re using one of the modules.
But any alumni that is being stored in metrics for the sake of historical records, archiving, then that doesn&#39;t count towards any, a student license.
And let me pull up. This last report here. So we can see here on this, this is the, ah, is active column.
And once we update the users and metrics, then this also needs to be a factor in whether or not a user is active.
Because this determines whether they&#39;re using the user&#39;s module and it&#39;s a a user that should be able to log in.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ff8e037a8938447f9190e9d597ef8350</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 15 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>This feature what we&#39;ll be adding is an upgrade to the CCC report.

Must be before the start date but I that shows up before the start date. Before I even select the end date.
So we should only show that alert after they select the end date. And then the other change we want to make here is when we when the administrators want to select residents, we want to change it to a radio button and from a radio button to a multi select so that they can select multiple residents
and if they select multiple residents, we want to change the download as PDF to a button to e-mail report to me.
So if there&#39;s only only one being selected, it will be download as PDF. If it is something that they&#39;re selecting multiple residents, we will show a button that says e-mail report e-mail reports as PDF.

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk through these issues and for bringing this up with the team at Italian.
We are fine with talking through the changes for the rate for next year. There is still one outstanding concern that we need to address for this year.
Is the number of active users that are on these servers. So reviewing our SOW, the way that the SOW stated, we&#39;re going to be doing an audit to determine the amount of unique student accounts utilizing any of the student&#39;s module.
The students module, the user&#39;s modules is one of the modules that is being used by a Talam for all of the schools.
If a user has an account in metrics, they&#39;re technically using the user&#39;s module. But in reality, there are two types of users in metrics.
Some are alumni that are being added for archiving. And there are users that are enrolled at the institution. So the active status is what determines whether they can log into the system and they&#39;re considered an active student.
Last year, when the audit was being performed, this was a issue that was raised by David Kepatch, who mentioned that the counts may be off because users were not deactivated.
And there was an exchange of email and David D had also mentioned that if the integration is is not deactivating users in metrics, that should be corrected.
And in the meantime, the list, the list can be cleaned up. And then David sorry, Kevin MacLeod had mentioned that instead of doing it that way, can we do it using the number of logins?
So that&#39;s not a good way for us to audit the number of users because login doesn&#39;t indicate whether or not a student is active.
Because a student can complete tasks in metrics by never having to log into the system. Have email notifications that go out.
They can click on a link and complete a task. You can add a schedule to the system and they and, and, and, or store data about a student.
And that&#39;s still considered a student license. The that&#39;s why we rely on a. Combination of data points such as whether there was a schedule evaluations.
But, and one of the data points is the active status. And that was something that was included on the audit report.
But when, when we, when the calculation was done. It used the logins instead of the active status. And we never corrected the, any issues with the integration to update the, the status.
So this methodology methodology has that one flaw, which is, and this was something that was discussed in an email with the and agreed upon last year.
Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a5ff9d03820f4638982ce595f66b7fa3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Update on Active Users 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon Kevin. I wanted to create this video so that there&#39;s more context to the issue that we&#39;re discussing with active users.
So reviewing the email exchange from last year that you shared with us, there was a concern that was raised by David about deactivated users.
Being in the system and that resulting in elevated student counts. And at the time there was a plan that David D had brought up about fixing the banner integration.
So metric statuses are getting updated with banner statuses. And in the end, in the short term, the plan was to deactivate any users that are no longer active.
But at that time I&#39;m not, it doesn&#39;t seem like that that fix for the integration was done and nor was the users deactivated.
Instead there was a change in the plan and the report that was generated looked into a few different data points.
And then a total was estimated. I believe this, the estimate is accurate, but that we still need to clean up the active users, because according to our SOW, the, the way that we are meant to count these users, and this is consistent across all of our clients and industry standard.
If an active, if a user is in the system, system and has an active status, then that&#39;s an active license.
If they&#39;re graduated and they&#39;re no longer logging into metrics, their account should be deactivated and then it wouldn&#39;t count towards the license.
So since a user&#39;s module is one of the modules that is being factored in. We have to address that. And if we take a look at the raw server and go to the users page and we have student user type, affiliation status is active.
There&#39;s 8,523 students in here. This needs to be updated so that alumni accounts are deactivated and they can no longer log into metrics.
And any users that are being added to the system for the sake of generating MSPE letters, those users will need a license.
Since they&#39;re using one of the modules and they can be left active. And this is the same situation for AUC.
There&#39;s over 8,000 users that are in both servers. I had a listed out the total counts in one of my previous emails.
Here this was the count for until for May 2nd, 2022 through May 1st, 2023. And both of these methodologies. Should result in the, well, it&#39;s really, it&#39;s the same methodology.
All we&#39;re doing is cleaning up the active users. The, because those users should not have an active status in metrics.
And it was meant to be cleaned up last year. And once they are deactivated, we should. Get the same count that we&#39;re getting with the number of students that have data in the system or have logged into the system.
And this is a column that we have on the report where is active is has a true. That is if it&#39;s false, then they&#39;re inactive.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this and if you want to go over to Nicole, it can be available later this week.
Thank you. Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a871141dc22c4d1eb4a9716471f164d5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Update 📈</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Cathy, I got your voicemail today with the faculty members being added to the system. It&#39;s a great work on that, thank you.
So for when we are using metrics, we&#39;ll have all the faculty in the system and, You can also see on the invite tab that when it&#39;s ready to be launched, you can go here to invite the faculty members into Metrics.
So you simply go in here, select and click invite, and then it&#39;ll send them a log. In to access metrics.
We don&#39;t need to do that yet, but soon. For incoming residents, if you need to get them into the system, this will be the same way you can do that.
One thing to note here is the activation date for each of these are set to June 1st and and 14, this means that they will not be able to log into metrics until then.
So if you, if that&#39;s okay, that&#39;s fine. If you need them to log in sooner than that, or if you need to send out any emails to them before that, you can adjust the activation date to an earlier date.
The other thing that I noticed is that on the, rotations page, we started adding the supervisors here. So if all of those are done, then then metrics will be able to start assigning evaluations.
If there are any missing, you can always go in here and click the icon to update them with the, supervisors.
For evaluation templates we have in the system, the only other piece that&#39;s missing is going to be making sure that we have enabled the appropriate roles for those templates and the evaluate a role, evaluate the roles, and then we also have the next assignment date entered.
So for example here, no active roles. So if I go to the assignment rules, I can. Check should this be automatically assigned if so then I can choose yes and apply the rule.
So you can check all of them to make sure that the roles and the dates for the relative dates. Have been added.
And then for schedules, whenever we have finalized it, we can always go in. Here and publish the schedules. So publishing it will make it available to the residents in the system and for evaluations module to start assigning evaluations.
So let&#39;s click the publish all button. And lastly, under advancement, we can set that up. A rule to advance the trainees from incoming resident to PGY1.
So if I select all my residents except for the PGY4s, I can collect advancement and then do we want the role to be changed to PGY1?
You can set that on a specific date or have that updated today.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/09ec01cf31b94d56985467137dbe0c15</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Bug on Calendar Page 🐛</pre></td><td><pre>This is a bug on the calendar page.

So when I let&#39;s do it again.

the dates. The data that comes out of the system doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s shown on the calendar. So you can see here Thursday, Friday, June 1st.
Okay, so it is showing up here. And I guess what we need to do is make sure this we want to make sure the date range the two field works and then on this view we can adjust the font size a little bit so that it&#39;s the title is a little bit smaller and the dates are a little bit smaller And we can also
show the venue and the speaker on there. Because otherwise they&#39;re not, actually we do have the venue and the speaker, yep.
So the only thing you need to do is make it a little bit, bit smaller and that should be sufficient.
And at the bottom it says quiet here. That fixed the filter for the end date. Adjust the, size of the font so that it&#39;s not so disproportionately big compared to the I think it&#39;s best to use size 10 font as the smallest.
And then for anything that is Thursday calendar use size 10 font and then for Actually, I would use, let&#39;s try using size 10 font for everything and see how that looks.
And we can use formatting such as bold or italics to select. And show. So for example, each of the dates can be bold, but they&#39;re all using size 10 font.
That&#39;ll make it look more concise and how.

page and if I go to the case template, every time I select the case template it shows a description here.
But there&#39;s a problem with this. One is it shouldn&#39;t show this text. Here, every time there is no description. It&#39;s unnecessary and it creates clutter.
And the other thing is, it always shows the first one which is not convenient for some of our clients because they may not be logged in the first case.
And you can see it just takes up space. So, what we want to do is slightly redesign this with the following updates.
One will turn this into a card where we select, you put the field here, select a template. And when they select a template on the right side we will show case description.
If there is no description to show nothing will show up on the right side. If there is only, by default, if there is only one template we will pre-select it.
But if there is more than one template. We will show it as blank and they will have to pick one to log the case.
The other updates that we want to do on this page is this bottom part. We can clean this up a little.
In general whenever we create a table we should set the width to minimize the number of rows that we have.
Because it looks cleaner when you have that. So for example increasing the width so that we don&#39;t have these arrows showing up in a separate column.
And for something like status we can use icons and get rid of the text to save space. So we view the pencil the pencil icon and the delete and when they hover over we can show a tooltip that shows that means delete.
And for the create date we don&#39;t need to create, show the time created for each of them. We can simply show the time with the date.
And it&#39;ll be Monday, December 22nd, 2022, 2pm EST. And that will be it. That will cut down on the rows here.
And for diagnosis scene and procedure scene, the preview button doesn&#39;t work or the hover doesn&#39;t work. We want to put that in the same color as this view and make sure that it&#39;s, works as a popover.
I think we can use it as a tool tip. Currently it says NA if there&#39;s we can show it directly on the table.
If there are several, we would actually most of the time there&#39;s only two things that are going to be logged.
So primary and secondary. So let&#39;s make it so that it will show the primary diagram. And and the secondary diagnosis by default on the table listed out.
And if it doesn&#39;t, if it has more than two, then we will show the preview as a popover or a tool tip.
And then. Performance, same thing. It doesn&#39;t work right now. We want to fix that. And when we hover over, we will show the performance and for all of these columns, let&#39;s fix the width so that we don&#39;t have these arrows showing all over the place.
And for search, let&#39;s update the search so that we rename it to Case, like, it should tell. The user, what they can search.
So we can put parentheses case name, case name here. And faculty name. And for the these changes that we&#39;re making, we&#39;ll also want to apply the same thing to the for the table, to the faculty portal and the admin portal.
And we&#39;ll also apply the width and making sure these models and popovers work and changing it to the icon.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e34c001fcc654b22910668520ec28232</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 12 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video we&#39;re going to be reviewing bugs that are happening on the Performance page in the Program Admin Portal.
And on the Program Admin Portal if we go to Performance and then go to the Competency tab, we&#39;ll have, a, sorry, not to the Competency tab, but to the CCC Report tab, we have a Select User field.
And on this page, if I search for one of the residents, click on the individual&#39;s name, click Download PDF. It&#39;ll download the PDF for that individual.
In this example, I&#39;m downloading an exam report for Jacob Luther. If I&#39;m an administrator that has several residents, and I type in the name of the next resident that I want to download the report for.
It looks as though I have selected the next resident. In this example, it&#39;s Madison Meek. And it looks selected on the screen and I click download.
And the problem is that you can see on this PDF, it&#39;s downloading. The report for the first resident, Jacob Luther, his report is being downloaded again, even though the system, the, the, the field looks like it&#39;s selecting the second resident.
This is dangerous because a coordinator accidentally downloaded the the same report for several residents by mistake and then brought this to a meeting.
And, and, and she did not realize that it was downloaded in the same report over and over because she simply typed in the name of the each resident and click the download to PDF.
What we have to do is make sure each time the rest each time you start typing into the field and searching, we clear the radio button and force the user to click on it.
Or. We only enable or, or we make sure that when they are filtered down to only one person, the person that is, the radio button that is enabled match the PDF that is being downloaded.
That would be a. Better solution. Either we had to make sure that the radio button is cleared or make sure that the PDF aligns with the person that is at the the radio button is showing us selected.
A couple of other bugs on this page, the select individual. On the competency graphs and the scatter plot tab. We want to make sure that the select individual or individual field is searchable.
We can use the same searchable field that we can use. We have on the reviews tab and apply it to the competency graphs and the scatter plot.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e30bbded74a24b428c18ae82f5d17aae</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 12 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this is going to be a bug on the performance page.

And on this tab, we have select user field. And the problem here is that if I search for one resident, let&#39;s say I search for Jacob.
Luther, and then select the date range, click download as PDF. And then I want to do, ah, a report for another resident.
I come in here and type in the name of the next resident. It looks as though this resident is being selected.
So I can click download. Download, but you can see that that the system is downloading the re- the report for the first resident that I ran the report.
So, it&#39;s very confusing for the user because is if I&#39;m searching for someone and it looks like it&#39;s being selected, I could accidentally download the report for the wrong person and send that to someone that shouldn&#39;t see the data.

Thank you for taking the time to talk through these concerns and for bringing them up with the Italem team.
So as for the rate adjustment, this is something that we can talk about in more detail in a future call and work through that for the future.
There is still one outstanding concern that we have about this year&#39;s renewal. I wanted to summarize everything in this video with more context.
And but I am available to meet if we want to talk about this in more, more in more detail. So according to the email chain that you had shared with me for last year, one of the outstanding concerns that David Capach had brought up in the email was the number of users that are, that are
still of active status. Users who should be deactivated is usually the reason why the numbers are off. So if someone graduated from the school in the school, then their account needs to be activated so that it&#39;s, they cannot log in and they&#39;re considered an inactive user.
That is one of the, one of the ways that we audit how many licenses this university is using. So this was brought up by David the CAPAC last year.
And David D had also mentioned that if a student status is supposed to be coming over from Banner and it&#39;s not working, that needs to be fixed.
And and then there was a plan to manually deactivate it. And then shortly after, after that Kevin McClaw had brought up an idea for calculating the log actual logins into the system to determine anyone use the system.
So that&#39;s not a good way to use the use the the or calculate the number of students because the fact that users data is being stored in metrics for different academic processes means that it&#39;s, it&#39;s an active account and we&#39;re responsible for that data.
And some of the tasks can also be completed without log. Being into metrics so evaluations can go out and people click on the link and complete the task without having to access the the, the interface.
So this audit report does factor in multiple things that user has used, such as whether evaluations were completed. Case logs are completed and active status was also one of the things that are on that report.
However, this is not something that was used when when the total numbers were calculated last year. Instead it was, it was.
Based on the last login and not the active status and the number of active users was never corrected. And technically any one of those students can be logging in because their account is active.
So. What we need to do is update their statuses. So the number of active users in metrics lines up with the number of enroll students.
And this is also consistent with our SOW. Which states that an audit of actual license usage for the particular school of the proceeding here will be completed by the supplier, vice-applier via examining data for each user.

The problem that we have is when we come, when we get this data, we only have a way to create a user.
We don&#39;t have a way to select an existing user and update their data. We don&#39;t have a way to start using what&#39;s in here.
So what we want to do is at the bottom, we turned this into a card and inside the card, we will have a radio button that says create new user in metrics.
And when that is selected all of these fields would show and the second, and function exactly as it is right now.
The next option, the second radio button will be. Actually, that may not work because that may prevent people from looking for it.
What we can do is instead do a step by step thing where. Or at the bottom it says search metrics to see if user exists.
And then what we want to do is. Give them a button.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ce360ce4f80a4c268e91cef3e751e897</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[DV-1549] Design Task: Clinical Schedules - Feature for Notifying Residents and Faculty of Schedule Changes - Jira - 1 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so for this feature, what we can do is add a setting under System Setup Settings, Hey Mike, so for the setting under Schedules, it will be enabling notifications for schedule changes.
And we can under it, we can say if the setting is enabled, metrics will send out a summary of schedule changes.
At the end of at the end of the day. So it will be one email that summarizes all of the changes to the block schedule and all of the changes to the shift schedule.
And what we want to do is. Take the. Go to the site rotator report and we could create. A table like this.
On in the email, so. Each change will show and. The old and the new so that the person knows that it&#39;s a.
Like a. Whether was it? It. Schedule those edited. Or I guess I guess what we can do is.. It can list out.
What was removed one section that says what was removed another section that shows what was added and it will show both.
Shift schedules and block schedules and we want to include the first name last. I&#39;m sorry that not the name because it&#39;s only going to one person.
We want to include the site site name site code. The date. The start date and date. Start the time. If it&#39;s a shift, start time and end time for shifts and the rotation name or shift name and the rotation code.
Depending on what it is. And we can also have a bootstrap tag that shows that whether it&#39;s a shift or a.
Rotation. So. Hi. On. Or we&#39;ll do added first. It&#39;ll be two tables. One after the other. And type. And that&#39;ll be the bootstrap tag which is shift or rotation.
And name. Or it&#39;ll show the code and the rotation. Or it&#39;ll just shift name. And the same thing here shows you all it&#39;s removed.
And it&#39;ll be one summary email that gets sent out at the overnight of all the changes that were made that day.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bebf3e25494341c49ef067c43af7e8ba</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Clinical Learning - Google Docs - 12 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;re going to cover the process for handling the clinical learning evaluation. This is a custom process that we have created based on how the evaluations are done for the laboratory courses as well as for the clinical courses.
Going to go through this step by step. And the first thing that I want to cover here is we have two sections in this document, clinical learning evaluation, laboratory courses, clinical learning evaluation for clinical courses.
And for each of them we have different set of forms that we&#39;re going to use. The goal is to drive this automatically based on when the students and the faculty members need to complete certain things.
Under the paper format that we, the school is currently using, they are having access to everything at once and they&#39;re filling in.
Handing it out and then handing it at the end handing it into the school at the end. Here, the goal is, as they progress through the eight week section, different things will get assigned to different individuals and they&#39;ll complete it and that may trigger some other action that someone else has
to take. So let&#39;s go through each of these. First thing here is laboratory courses. And let&#39;s do that. Laboratory courses.
For this, we&#39;re focusing on the evaluation components. I know that this document does have skills sections. And return demonstrations on here.
That&#39;s going to be handled in the case logging module. But for this discussion in this video, we&#39;re going to be on on the discussing the competencies and the comment fields that they have to complete.
So. We have broken this up into five forms. So we have. The midterm, the final, and then the weekly feedback.
So the midterm is going to have two forms, one for the student, for the self-evaluation. That will contain. All of these competencies and the section from here, which includes the comments and, the goals areas progressed on, areas to focus on, as well as the.
Overall evaluation. So if we go to metrics and we open up the laboratory courses form, you can see the competencies and at the bottom we have overall performance, student learner comments, goals, areas progressed in.
Areas to focus on. Then the idea is that our outbound module will. See that the student has submitted their evaluation and then assign a faculty evaluation.
The faculty evaluation will have the same set of questions for the competencies, the overall performance, but their own different set of comment fields.
And we&#39;re going to use our summative, summative evaluation functionality so that the faculty members can see the student&#39;s evaluation. When they&#39;re completing their own form.
So you can see here, faculty CLE form, open that up. So I&#39;m looking at it as if I&#39;m a faculty member and you can see this was assigned for this rotation here.
I&#39;m using chamber lens post license program as a for the courses. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s joined those courses. But when the BSN program is set up, it&#39;ll show those, the appropriate courses here.
But you can see I&#39;m a faculty member. I&#39;ve opened up a form for. For completing an evaluation for this test user right at the top.
I can view what the student has submitted and read through everything. Including the comments, and then I can fill out my own form and submit that to the school.
So it&#39;s a streamless process for the student to submit it that to trigger a evaluation from a faculty member and the faculty member being able to submit it.
You&#39;re able to see the student&#39;s submission at the top so that they can they don&#39;t have to go to a separate page to look it up.
The same thing will apply for the final. So I have a final form for the student. When the student submits it, faculty&#39;s form will be assigned.
And then they&#39;ll be able to complete that. We can also set it up so that both forms assigned at the same time and the faculty can see that the student hasn&#39;t completed it.
That&#39;s also a possibility. It&#39;s just a setting that we have, it&#39;s simply a setting that we have to enable. Next thing here is going to be the, ah, weekly formative feedback.
So if I look at this form, we have our, weekly formative feedback for eight weeks for that. We&#39;re going to have.
This simple form where it will be assigned on a weekly basis. Add a new basis to the students. And when, when the student submits it, the faculty members will be able to.
Write a comment and then the faculty and the students can then go back and review the comments and acknowledge they have reviewed the com, the feedback from the faculty.
So let&#39;s take a look at that. So you can see here this is a weekly formative feedback comments that was submitted by our test student.
If I was to open it up as a faculty member. I can see the comments and then come down and submit my review.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4eaadbf2ee3b4b51b97de1bae26f6f10</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU - Return Demonstrations</pre></td><td><pre>For return demonstrations, again this is going to be the case logging, since it is a case log that they&#39;re entering.
The difference is going to be for return demonstrations we&#39;re going to have to keep track of the first and second attempts.
So we can have one form template. Which will have all of the diagnosis, that&#39;ll be for the first attempt and then that&#39;s a copy of that for the second attempt.
So the faculty when they&#39;re seeing a student perform one of these demonstrations, they&#39;ll use the first form initially and if for some reason they failed it and they need to repeat it.
They&#39;ll have a second form. For the second attempt and that way we can use a second form to trigger a CLC if needed.
And then from the student side. They can keep track of the different procedures and whether or not they met the requirements.
So for this example, we loaded the return demonstrations, but you can see we have an update of the minimums. It&#39;s, it&#39;s going to be.
One and once they have successfully logged a return demonstration, have it approved, it&#39;ll have met the requirement. And if they, if they log it and it&#39;s it&#39;s a failure, then they&#39;ll be able to we&#39;ll have that.
That in the record but it will not give them credit. And then the second time they submit second time they attempt the return demonstration.
If it is approved, then it&#39;ll give them credit. If it did not get approved, then they will, we&#39;ll be able to.
Use that submission to trigger a clinical learning contract. So that part will need to be custom developed, but I believe that will give the faculty members the easiest workflow.
So I made a note of that here. We have to. Add the ability to generate a CLC from a case log submission.
And then we&#39;ll also need to figure out how we&#39;re going to notify the retention advisor if the student fails the course.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/920ac9de6b684cfeac845126588f230f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 31 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon. I wanted to create this video to review some of the setup that we have done already and also to make a list of things that we had to finish up.
So starting with the users page, one of the things that I noticed is that we have all the residents in the system.
We also want to start working towards creating any of the faculty members here. Starting with the residents, we created them from eRAS.
So this will usually bring in the eRAS email address and showing their medical school email address or Gmail account. You could.
Once they have a email account with your organization, you can always go in there and update it. So it&#39;s possible for them to use your institutional email to log into Metrix.
So that&#39;s done by clicking the button, clicking on the person. Click Edit Demographics, and then changing that email address when it&#39;s, when it needs to be updated.
And then currently we&#39;re using incoming resident for their role. When it, when it comes to New York, we will want to come in here.
And update this role to PGY1. Next, about the faculty members that are going to be training these residents, we need to create those accounts in metrics too.
So this can be done two ways. One is using the add person faculty option, and we can use this to create each account one by one.
And when we&#39;re making this account, we need to specify the first name, last name, email, address, and then the role is going to be mostly post core faculty members.
But if they&#39;re someone that&#39;s not part of the core faculty, you can put them as supervising physicians and everything. Everything else is optional.
If someone, if a faculty is being created and they&#39;re going to be managing a specific rotation or set up rotations, what I mean by managing, I mean there are going to be completing evaluations for a specific resident.
You can add them as a supervisor for that rotation directly from that user creation page. So I can click this and choose one of my rotations and then any time a resident is assigned to this individual.
So that&#39;s the manual creation process. There&#39;s also a bulk import functionality in the top left. So we can do a spreadsheet and then do an import and that will be a create multiple faculty members at once.
So on the users page, create making sure the residents are updated with their contact information and ensuring that the faculty members are added are the two next steps.
Anybody and anybody that is added to the system. We&#39;ll need an invitation on the invite tab so they get a temporary password.
They&#39;re able to log into metrics. Then on the calendar page, you could create events for any of the things that&#39;s going to be happening in the residency program.
This could be orientation events. It could be a noon lecture that&#39;s going to be happening. So the residents are all going to be having morning lecture or noon lecture.
You can go into the calendar and create an event and then invite them using their roles. One thing I want to emphasize here is right now they&#39;re all set up as incoming residents.
Whenever we invite them, we will also want to use the PGY1 role because we&#39;re going to be changing that role later into PGY1.
And you can create, repeating events if needed for any sort of lectures and stuff that&#39;s going to be happening on a recurring basis.
Then we have the schedules. To set up the schedules, we have to make sure that we have the, rotations added.
So on the rotations page, let me make sure I&#39;m accessing it as a, There we go, okay. So on the rotations page, we have 20 rotations added.
Want to confirm that everything that we need is in here. Linked to the correct site. And once we have the correct site linked, you can also specify which faculty members are going to be in charge of each rotations.
So that&#39;s done by clicking on a specific rotation and choosing this. Icon for faculty slash staff. And then I can say this individual, Kathy, is going to be a faculty member for this particular rotation.
So once you have, this is, this can only be done once. The faculty members are added to the system. The last piece here is content.
So if you have goals and objectives that are created for each of these rotations, you can click on the View Resources button and that will open up this folder and I can add a file that will be sent out to the right.
So this is going to be for capturing any sort of goals and objectives or other resources they have to be aware of before they start a particular rotation.
Once we have the also. So. If this particular site is not in here, we would want to create that on the sites page on the institutional portal.
So. Now all sites have to be added from the institutional portal. Even though you can&#39;t see them on the person on the admin portal, all the institutional administrators can create new sites.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f0d0657dd0c742259f162f5cc6ad1b1a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Clinical Learning - Google Docs - 12 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning everyone. It&#39;s been a few weeks since our last call. I wanted to put together this video to summarize what we&#39;ve been working on.
Over the past month or so, we&#39;ve been looking at each of the different processes that CU has for the BSN program and then figuring out how we can digitize them.
And I&#39;m very excited to share this document with these videos so that you can review them and provide any feedback.
And I believe we, with this onboarding plan, we can fully digitize the entire BSN journey. And there are some customizations that we have to do.
The goal was to try to, how do we get this fully in metrics and easy for the faculty and students to use.
So let&#39;s start with the, the attendance process. So attendance is going to be handled using case logging and the schedules module.
And we&#39;re going to be loading the clinical experiences into the block schedule for eight weeks. And that&#39;s going to be what is tied into the case logging.
So when a student logs a cage, metrics knows which site or rotation that they&#39;re going to be going to. We&#39;ll have two templates, one for lab and one for clinical, and each of them will have a different set of questions.
And one of the questions on there will be what type of activity are you completing? And if we go into metrics, this is a demo environment that we were using to test out these functionality.
So if we go into case log, we have a few fields that we added here, but you can add. More, you can select the age, the case setting and the date.
And when you select the date, it&#39;ll automatically select the appropriate rotation if there was an attendance record entered or it was a schedule entered.
And then you can select like the activity type. So again, this is a proof of concept. You can have as many fields as you want here that captures all different details about the case.
What we were trying to do is mainly capture the case log type for this testing. When we actually do, the onboarding, we&#39;ll be able to add additional fields like the diagnosis type the, ah, more details about the, ah, the, ah, site and anything else that we want to add.
So two case templates, one for key, ah, clinical logs, another one for, lab case logs. And you can see here, for this one, I had added some duration field.
So we&#39;ll be able to add the same thing for the clinical and capture how long the case took. And the date will give us the attendance that we need.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/020cd0cf54144bb190c25af50887d16b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>DreamStudio - 30 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Ericsson.

So let&#39;s say we do origami. And then the prompt is going to be what it uses to generate the image.
So this is just a direct, this is a sample prompt that it created. I can click on this to create a random one.
And then there&#39;s also a. Way to edit how many images it generates. You can usually generate four at a time.
So this each time I generate is uses some credits. That we have purchased. Feel free to experiment as much as needed.
And then. So if I click generate. So it created this. Then here, let&#39;s see if I want to do a doctor getting an award.
Then you can see that I changed the prompt image based on that. So if I don&#39;t want to use origami and I want to use a different style, you can change that.
And you see that this one for example looks pretty good and we can probably use that. It takes a bunch of experimentation and you could come up with different images.
And then you can download it and use it. And it also, keep in mind that this is not, doesn&#39;t have to be the final output.
You can probably export this, bring it into another software and make edits to it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dc8c73d321714cae8f397c4f7c613d7c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Write up Dev Tasks - Google Docs - 30 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, so in this video, I&#39;ll review how to go from a loom video to a Jira task.

New curriculum will have both the abnormal and the normal talk together. So for example, Physiology, the abnormal physiology start. In a different course than the normal physiology.
The curriculum the new curriculum will have single module format where the physiology, for example, will have the abnormal physiology And normal physiology in one module.
There&#39;d be two modules offered per semester. There are three terms per year, 15 weeks each, and each of those terms will have two modules.
The first semester that, or the first term. That we&#39;ll use a new curriculum is fall 2023. And this will start on September 2023.
And we&#39;ll, as part of this new curriculum. There will be a change in the mapping of the objectives. In the new curriculum, we will have global objectives.
And we will have to program objectives. Program objectives map to course objectives. Course objectives map to session objectives. So for the first semester, the school has already.
We finished the mapping and that information needs to be imported into metrics. Going forward after every term, they will have.
A new set of modules starting each term, so there&#39;ll A term for the spring and they&#39;ll have. Two new modules that is switching over to the new curriculum.
A module is made of.. Okay, so the action items for the school administration is the following. They have to the school has to create.
. New. To create new course content. Including the objectives and the mappings for each each of the modules that are changing.
So for the fall and. Spring each of those two modules that are changing. They have to create that content from by mixing.
The existing modules. Yes. The existing modules will be mixed together. So the first step will be to. Think. Decide what information sh the first step is setting up the d levels that are switching o we will want to create t import the data using s Sprehm machine convert Source and that can be done
when it comes to the coding We also want to use a coding structure that uses the name.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bb802deaee644b0d98622f0f1fc07971</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Marcus. So for St. James, they came to us in I think 2019 or 2020 and initially we work with them to streamline their curriculum module and migrated all for you.
Here&#39;s their curriculum to metrics. Then I reached out to them about expanding to the clinical side and I I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re doing.
It&#39;s based out of. Anguilla. I don&#39;t know how to pronounce that, but they have. Students that go there for the first two years and then they come to the United States and do clinical rotations at various hospitals.
So Joe and his team manages the clinical experiences. So these are going to be the clerkships and the electives that the students have to do in the third and fourth year.
So Joe&#39;s team includes, Joe&#39;s the manager and he includes multiple coordinators. They take the students that are coming into clinicals and they find clinical rotations for them in different hospitals or the students find them sometimes and they make sure that that site is approved and schedule them
there and then they collect performance evaluations from the students and the preceptors there and once the evaluations are collected they also put in any sort of funneled grape.
So, the big projects that we have worked with them on is about scheduling. So, we have created various schedules for all their students and these metrics and then as they go from one location to the other, their schedules are configured in metrics and published so that students know where they&#39;re going
and administrators have one step to the other. So, we have a central place to manage this instead of doing it via Excel and then also the external site coordinators at each of these hospitals can have access to metrics and those hospital administrators can see which students are coming there.
In advance. And they&#39;re also using our case logging module for keeping track of various patients that they&#39;re seeing at these hospitals to make sure they have good clinical experience.
And they&#39;re also using evaluations to collect feedback from the preceptors that work with the students. So streamlining all that process for that team and coordinating everything in one platform has made it easier for them to send these students to different hospitals across the country and keep
track of where they are. Make sure they have all the academic requirements. And we are ready to be graduating and completing their medical training.
We also work with them over several months to streamline these processes. We do 30 minute calls with them where we discussed their process and helped them clean up the data and centralize it.
Everything Joe was included in the initial presentation. So he was not the decision maker, but we demoed to him and his team.
And they provided feedback to the leadership to purchase metrics. So it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a. He was involved with the buying process.
The fundamental problem I would say is, is, is going to be that clerkship scheduling and, and scheduling is probably the number one, but then collecting that data associated with those students are scheduled there with case logs.
And evaluations is a secondary thing. But but the scheduling is probably the number one. So how has life changed since then?
They can manage everything in one platform, provide real time visibility to all the stakeholders, including students, and then keep them updated or any of any changes.
So purchasing decision was made by me talking to the the vice president of the medical school, and then Joe and his team was brought in to look at the demo and then make provide their feedback.
And once it was purchased, they started using it. And okay, hopefully that helped. Please let me know if I can provide anything else.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/10301226bdb14ee5b21dc71bb99145d5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 26 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this change that we&#39;re working on will apply to the personal portal. There are four personal portals that we have faculty, staff, student, and resident, and it&#39;s going to apply for all of them.
And what we&#39;re doing is consolidating the reviews. The reviews evaluations page with the evaluations page over here. And. We also have these rotator report and evaluator report that shows up under review.
. That we&#39;ll leave there for now. In the follow up task, we&#39;ll consolidate that too. But what we&#39;re doing is taking the evaluations page and putting it.
Like the review evaluations page and putting it as a separate tab on my evaluations. So. For. Each of these pages.
Mike&#39;s video will go into the specific detail. And the main thing is that we&#39;re applying the same.. Same code that we are using for the advent side and we&#39;re trying to consolidate the views into one.
Page that shows different data based on who&#39;s using it. So on the. The evaluations page will have the reviews evaluations will be moved to reviews here and it&#39;ll have the same.
Now that we have one of the things that I wanted to make sure that we adjust here is. That we have here.
This first. First page has the original view that we currently have. And this is the new view where we. So status evaluation status.
This actually, we only need to have one status. We will need two. And then. A value t roll. Actually Mike, so there is, so evaluate t and evaluate tour when I was discussing the role here.
It would be for, It&#39;s eleven o&#39;clock. So, yeah, so if it&#39;s gonna be selecting the value at, you can select one or more, or you can select the whole role.
And the archived. The archived, yes or no, we don&#39;t need it. Since we&#39;re gonna be including it as a status.
The status and the top so they choose archived, it will show the archived ones. It will be good if we can use a different color.
So maybe on archive would be green and then archive would be red. So it stands out when we&#39;re looking at it.

As a course mentor, when you log into Metrics, you&#39;ll see a evaluations and assignments menu item on the left left navigation.
So, if you click on it. Evaluations, a sub menu will open up and it&#39;ll have an assignments page. On this page there&#39;ll be several filters at the top that can be used to narrow down the student or the portfolio items that you need to work with.
One of the filters, for example, will be the Evaluate Tour filter that can be used to find the student&#39;s name and there&#39;s also a filter called Forms that can be used to find specific form that you want to work with.
The status of a submitted status of a portfolio item should be submitted in order for you to provide that feedback to the trainee.
So if you scroll to the bottom, you&#39;ll see a table with all of the submissions. And if you click on the view most recent response button, that will open up a new window where you can submit a review.
This is what that window looks like and at the top it&#39;ll be the name of the person that submitted the form.
And then there&#39;ll also be questions that they answered or the attachment that they submitted with the portfolio item. And although at the bottom, if you look at a section called review and sign, there, there will be a field to write any comments and a drag and drop section to attach a file.
So if the student sent a file with their, with their portfolio document, you can download that file, open it up in your local computer, review it, and then put any comments into that document and attach it back into this, this window.
And then when you click sign review, it will send the comments along with the attachment back to the student. And the last screenshot here, we&#39;re looking at what the review will look like after it&#39;s submitted by the course mentor.
We have the signature of the course mentor and the attachment that they added. And the student will receive this on their end and their portal and they can download it, look at it, and resubmit the portfolio item with the feedback incorporated into it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/146ce3a85ebd4c78b8fc16926575fddc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 8 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Claire, so for this staging server, it will have a backup of your production database loaded every day. And in order to log into the staging environment, you have to use a loaded every day.
And in order to log into the staging environment, you have to use a sign-on for accessing metrics right now. You will not have a login in metrics.
So what you have to do first is in your version of metrics, the production environment, you can go into your profile by clicking on it, click edit demographic.
And then go down to change password and then set a password for yourself. And what happens is overnight, this database will get loaded.
Into the staging server and then tomorrow you&#39;re able to log into metric using this password that you set. So the first step is in the production environment, create a password.
Then second step is tomorrow, go to the staging URL and log in using that password. And then once you are in staging, you.
Can do whatever you want and the staging environment gets wiped out every day with the new database from production. So any of the changes that you make will only be there for one day.
If you need to be testing it for multiple days, there is a way for. Just to keep the backup from getting loaded.
You can let us know if you need that. Otherwise it gets refreshed every day. But since the password that you created was set up on the new database is loaded, it will have the same password.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1705e04af0a54598869aaa9ec87aa14d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>DV board - Agile Board - Jira - 1 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this video I&#39;m gonna go over how to quality check the specs. So some of the things that I&#39;m looking for when I&#39;m looking at these items in WIP.
So the first thing I&#39;m noticing is that some of these tasks are put in as tasks. I&#39;m not sure if this matters.
I&#39;ll leave it alone for now. And my assumption was we had to put as feature. Or a bug. And then the next thing I&#39;m looking for is whether it, what is written here is clear.
It&#39;s not necessary for the, functionality check to figure out exactly what is wrong with the system. If the person doesn&#39;t know the functionality.
But fairly is making sure that what&#39;s explained here is, is makes, in the sense users program administrators button, the model should only show users that are active administrators.
So, this is pretty clear. The things that are missing here are the URL and a video. It&#39;s missing those two items.
So, I&#39;m going to put this as, Design done. What we need is to fix, Finish up the specs. Next up, Dashboard for admin users only when several videos are added to the announcement section.
It breaks out of the container. It breaks out of the container. So this is something that we will need. We need to show the devs how to recreate it in a loom video.
And unless this is, if this video is still on the AUC staging server, we can. Show it on a loom video and use that.
So it&#39;s missing a loom video, basically. And the other recommendation that we want to have here is what should a dev do?
Is it, if they have four videos like this that are added, should they? A shrink it down and show it in there or should they stack them on top of each other?
So that&#39;s something that we want to put a recommendation in there. So essentially for quality checking, I&#39;m seeing the problem.
And I&#39;m seeing the problem here, but it&#39;s missing the solution. The devs are,yeah, so these are all just sample text.
It&#39;s not giving the dev what the solution, should be. And it&#39;s also missing the loom video. Hm.uh. Nuts seeing the.
Design status. On the feature. Anyway, so that&#39;s if I had the field, I would have added as. Design in progress.
Next up we have. This is. So I&#39;m. Noticing a problem here. With the workflow. This is currently. In a whip.
It&#39;s missing details. And there&#39;s no way to. Sign off on it as being ready. Since we don&#39;t you we don&#39;t have the design status.
For bugs. Anyway, so continuing on. We&#39;ll figure that out later. For. This task here. Benefits time off accounts really confusing because we will don&#39;t understand what.
There&#39;s not really anything here. So I&#39;m gonna move this out of whip. Indicate. The clase duration, feed migration at an hours.
. Yeah, this is doesn&#39;t have anything in here, so I&#39;m not sure what why this is in whip. And I don&#39;t have a way to.
Put a design status here. Use the high black schedule. High pass.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/726dc92803b947e5b921c4f40c44bfe9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 24 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So for this task, what we&#39;re doing is taking the curriculum course summary report, and then we&#39;re going to put that on the personal portal.
So if we, go to curriculum, setup. So we go to curriculum, setup. And permissions, we can give view only access or edit access to different individuals.
And we can also give director access to individuals. So if someone is given full curriculum access or they&#39;re designated as director of a course, they&#39;ll see the curriculum in their personal portal.
So let&#39;s. Pick. Don&#39;t think we have any test users here. Let&#39;s use metric support and we can see curriculum here.
Go to reports and then we have a set of curriculum reports. What we want to do is add that other report here.
So when, We run the criteria. We can select the courses that we&#39;re in charge of. If I&#39;m a course director, I can only see the courses for my the my courses.
If I am a, leadership person that have access to the full curriculum, then I can run the report for the entire curriculum.
So if they have view or edit access to the full curriculum or if they have course director access, we&#39;ll show that report and then be able to select the courses they have permissions for.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6b3428309f894b7d854328a1acbad520</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU BSN User Access - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 2 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Faria. I hope you&#39;re doing well. And I&#39;m looking over these comments here. I&#39;m assuming this is for the different users that will be engaging with metrics for the BSN program.
So first thing that I want to comment is the, User categories will likely be created as separate metrics roles. And we create the roles on our end once we have decided what&#39;s appropriate.
And in general, it&#39;s always best to be generic. Then use roles that match any sort of real world titles. So for example, like Dean of Academic Affairs versus Associate Dean of Faculty.
In metrics, we simply will create a role called Dean. And that should cover any of the metrics. For something like Faculty of Record or Primary Instructor, we would simply either use like core faculty or faculty or primary instructor.
And then, it, a clinical visiting professor would also be a faculty. A preceptor may need to have a separate function functionality metrics so we can create that as a separate role.
And a good way to think about this for metrics is think about how information will be assigned to them. So for, if you have evaluations that are going to be assigned, we can target different evaluations based on people&#39;s roles.
So if you have a bunch of evals that are going out for preceptors, then you want to have a separate role for them.
If those evaluations are, you don&#39;t want that those to be assigned to faculty. Another thing here is faculty primary as well as secondary roles for.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/520b825c846a4a6ea8e319c9fad16da4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>How to add new faculty and set them as Rotation Supervisors</pre></td><td><pre>This video will take a look at how to create a new user. To create a new user, Click on the users page, go to add person and then select the type of person you want to create.
I can choose faculty, then I can add a photo by clicking add photo for the name of the program. I&#39;m going to select the specialty, then first name, last name, then an L address, and then home institution, role, and activation date.
Those are going to be the required fields that must be completed to create this user. They all have a little morehammed v they also have an L address 15 ribbon and om faculty member you can add them directly to a rotation by clicking on this update rotations button it&#39;ll show a list of all the rotations
in my program then i can click add and it&#39;ll connect them to that rotation so instead of having to go to the rotations page and selecting faculty members it can be done directly from the user creation page so when we add a rotation supervisor it&#39;s telling metrics that this individual will be responsible
for completing evaluations for that rotation. So once it&#39;s added you simply have to maintain the schedule for the resident or student and metrics will automatically distribute evaluations to the rotation supervisors.
So that&#39;s why it&#39;s important for us to designate that here. This once you update it here you can always go back to the.
The rotations page and change the rotations of advisor if necessary.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fc312826e63b42518bea0785fc4eac85</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>AACOM Conference.pptx - Google Slides - 26 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So here&#39;s a slide d*** for the AECOM conference. When you&#39;re meeting with the people that come to the booth, first thing to find out obviously is to what institution they&#39;re coming from, what&#39;s their, role, and once we find that information, then we can kind of customize our pitch to what their
needs are. This starts off with the overall big picture of our, our company and how we are focused on making sure that the medical students and the educators have more time to teach and learn by making the platform user-friendly and being able to get things done fast.
And then the next slide kind of covers some common trends that we&#39;ve noticed in the market and where the trainees and the faculty members are frustrated with software It&#39;s difficult to navigate, administrators are frustrated with the amount of TD&#39;s work And here you can ask like how do you manage your
schedules for your pre clerkship and clerkship And the pre clerkship they may tell you that they&#39;re managing it on google calendar or outlook or spreadsheets And for clerkship they may be managing it on a excel and emailing it back and forth And that gives you an opportunity to get into the conversation
about how metrics would streamline that And make a personalized calendar for the pre-clerkship students For ACOM schools or the DO schools that personalized calendar has been a huge hit Because most of these schools are creating some generic calendar Then their students have to reference a spreadsheet
and figure out where exactly they&#39;re supposed to be and what group they&#39;re in So for MSU, KICOM, Kansas City They were all excited about the idea of having a personalized schedule for the students And for the clerkship, the big things are the schedule that allows the student the site administrators
to have visibility to who&#39;s going to come there, being able to collect evaluations and case logs and emphasize the importance of case log and how they can track whether or not the students are having enough exc- exposure and whether the site itself has enough patience.
So those are the things that&#39;s, that can be branched off or from the administrators being frustrated. And the last thing is the IT and how the metro- metrics is able to integrate with other platforms and the deans and people like that may not really care too much about that.
But they, you know, you can mention the idea that metrics plays well with other systems. And this slide. It&#39;s not really a lot to go into here other than to highlight a few major things here.
The requirements module in medical school, they call it compliance tracking. So we&#39;re, we&#39;re trying to emphasize that metrics. Track the compliance documents that students have to complete when they first start.
We have the ability to manage the full curriculum and we also provide training on how to standardize it and clean up the data.
Evaluations and assessment for, all four years. Case logging, MSPE and scheduling for all four years and outbound for advanced business notifications based on their business rules.
So if you can highlight a few of these things depending on their role and then lastly getting into how we typically onboard medical schools and essentially there are a few different projects that we complete with them.
And first is the basics. Well, one of the projects is basic science. So each of these are the basic sciences where they can get personalized student calendars, curriculum, course evaluations.
Then clerkships can have the core elective scheduling, 360 degree evaluations and case logs. And then a separate project after that will be curriculum which so each of these projects probably take about two to three months to onboard.
And a organization that is switching to us for the full system may take a year, year and a half to go through everything.
So I always tell them in the meetings what is the number one thing that you are interested in. We typically start with that and then you can branch into the other areas over time.
And finally, it&#39;s also good to go into metrics and highlight the user. It&#39;s an ability aspect of it. Don&#39;t need to show everything.
That the couple of things that gets people excited in the medical school world is the, the, the curriculum tree map and how they can see everything connected together.
The evaluations and the assignment rules. And showing how easy it is to set up those rules by answering those questions.
And the MSBE and being able to pull up an MSBE and show how all that data comes together. So Chris can set up a couple of tabs that.
Whoever else is going to be demoing can pull up these, these those three things. And that&#39;s all we need to show.
We don&#39;t need to show the full system. They want to ask about scheduling. You can pull up a block schedule, but it&#39;s not something that you have to spend a lot of time.
And the, you know, this is a summary slide that basically emphasizes, and our main focus is usability. And when we come to onboarding, we also in.
We engage a physician to help the deans build processes. And then we also have a one platform that can use for classroom and clerkship.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2c98a842709c4666a50082dfcd6fdbb8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Re: Medtrics - 1 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this is an update to the schedules page that can be accessed by going to slash schedules and to try out the goal is to add a couple more things here that will allow us to give more value to different client types.
So for example, one of the things that we want to add here is a rotation filter so that if I&#39;m a rotation director I can filter by my rotation.
And see who&#39;s coming there quickly. Some people may not figure out they can search down here. So having that rotation filter at the top on this page and on the timeline view will make it easier for them.
The other update that we want to do here is make it so that. We can have a little icon next to each of these names, little small hospital icon, so that when you.
Click on it. It&#39;ll bring up a modal that shows the site details. So. The name of the site, the address.
The site leaders. In a modal. So if I&#39;m working on a specific site, I can look that up here. And then for.
Next to the name. If you click on that, it&#39;ll bring up a modal that shows details about the resident or the other user.
So it&#39;ll show their photo, their first and last name. Class of. Role. Home institution. Phone number. Secondary phone number. Email address.
Page your number.. In that modal. So. Two icons. That one for, this can be a little, little. Actually, instead of icons, maybe cleaner for us to make these into links so that they can click on it.
I don&#39;t know, we can try, see which one looks better. And then when they click on it. It brings up the model.
You kind of see that here. And I&#39;m clicking on a person and it&#39;s bringing up the details about that shift.
Phone number. I mean the secondary phone number. Photo roll. And on the timeline view. Same idea. Click here. If I click on.
Well here if I click on it, it goes to the users. You know, it would be nice. Like when I click on this, it&#39;ll go.
... And. And. Deeper into the big thing, but. It&#39;s not always. It&#39;s not gonna be obvious. For the user that they call.
They get back to it. . And then I click on the previous thing. So like I have to go here. And to click here.
To reset everything. So people may not know that. It would be nice if at the top right. We have a bright button.
Like an orange button that says.. Reset. Reset button. That&#39;ll clear the people and the schedules that they have clicked on.
And as for bringing up the site details and the people of person details. Since these things are clickable already, we&#39;ll want to do a an icon in here.
So I can click on the icon it&#39;ll, or we can have a little site button here. And if I click on it, it&#39;ll bring up the model for the site.
If, and then next to the name. We&#39;ll have another icon that brings up the details for the, the user. So to review, we have rotation drop down.
We have the. The ability to click on the link or an icon to bring up the site details. The ability to click on and bring up the people&#39;s details and then the same thing on the timeline view.
And then on the timeline view also adding a reset button that will reset the things that you&#39;ve clicked on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4d8fd71b3a744b209d9b08cc87b5bb5f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 26 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so a couple of things that, two small tasks I&#39;d like you to add is a meeting with Zandra from Garnet.
And she&#39;s using metrics a lot. For requirements. And one of the things that she&#39;s having issues with is on the assignments page.
When she goes to the filter, she has 30 different requirements and she has to. And she&#39;s trying to turn on each of these one by one, which is a pain in the butt.
So, and there&#39;s two categories of these type of requirements. There&#39;s institutional and then there&#39;s program level requirements. What. What we want to do is use that you tree select that has the nested.
Let&#39;s see if I can find it. Yeah, this thing here. The, where you can select the category and all items in there will be selected.
So this first one will be in. Institutional requirements and then it&#39;ll list out all the institutional requirements. Second one will be program requirement.
List out all the program requirements. So she can click on the category and it&#39;ll show all, it&#39;ll select all the institutional ones.
Unless she wants us to pick out individual institutional requirements. So, the task would be for us to update the, Select requirements drop down on the institutional and program admin portal on the requirements slash assignments page to use the Butri Select field that allows these institutional requirements
to be grouped and the program requirements to be grouped so she can select all of them at once. That&#39;s the first task.
The second one is this thing that I&#39;m discussing in bug prioritization. This can go up so routine, but non-critical on the institutional portal where we have the ability to deactivate a requirement.
I mean a site, but we don&#39;t have a way to deactivate a we don&#39;t have a way to delete. Them.
So what we want to do is show the delete button. If the requirement does not have any records. Linked to it.
So we have these other records in here. If they haven&#39;t added any rotations, records have been added the delete button will be grayed out.
And if they hover over it, we&#39;ll show a little tool tip that says site cannot be deleted. Unless the associated records are also deleted.
Yeah, you can decide whether we want to do the tool tip or we can show a, modal, like a sweet alert that pops up when you try to delete, when you try to delete it.
Actually, here&#39;s the three options. One option is to not show the delete button at all. You can delete it. Second option is to do a tooltip.
And a grayed out delete button. Or the third option is to show the delete button, let them click on it, and it&#39;ll show an alert with instructions that says, you have to delete all of the records that&#39;s associated with this before this site can be deleted.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2b8b476aaca24a1484d862614b73eec2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Gary, thank you for pointing that out to us and notice that when you&#39;re saving the draft, it&#39;s telling you that it&#39;s going to be saved on to do.
This tab used to be called to do, that&#39;s why it was that alert, it&#39;s a lot outdated, we need to change the text on there.
Now it&#39;s called for me and then about me. So if you have a draft, it&#39;s going to end up on the Z this for me tab.
So it&#39;s basically for me to complete. And the other question that you had about the due date if you manually assign it or if it&#39;s automatically assigned it should show.
So, for example, if I go back to the homepage here, we have 103 evaluations and the due date shows up here.
And if I go to the evaluation. There are due dates for anything that is overdue. So this filter up here allows.
The user to filter by different statuses and see what&#39;s due and what&#39;s Overdue and on the dashboard, it will show a due date as long as one was selected when it was being manually assigned.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0d88cffa8a9b4023bf959a7ddcabe19e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (673) - 24 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Image. So the reason that you&#39;re having that issue is because Site Rotator Report doesn&#39;t allow you to filter by inactive sites.
So if I go to the institutional portal sites page and search for image. So with Shable Veterinary Hospital you can see Site Code 538 is under the active tab and then so there seems to be a duplicate site and one of them is inactive.
So the best way to correct this is you have two rotations that are linked to this inactive site. You can go to the admin portal.
Go to system setup rotations and have that site remap to the active site and then remove the inactive one. So this way you&#39;re not you don&#39;t have duplicates and the report will work properly.
So I&#39;m not sure why we have duplicates and why one of them was inactive. It might have been something that we were, like, long ago, past few months as we were setting it up.
And we have duplicates and the report will be deactivated. One more thing I want to point out here is since they both name the same, it&#39;ll be easier for you to identify the active one if you make a temporary name change.
Both low-lun dash or something afterwards, make the change on the rotations and then come back here, rename it back, and delete the inactive one.
That should take care of the issue. And one more thing that, we can discuss later is whether or not we want to include inactive sites on that report for reporting.
So, right now we&#39;re not including it. It&#39;ll show the data for all the schedules. But if you go to the drop down at the top and you select an inactive site it won&#39;t work.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d276487b8b1f4883bab8be298b2d4850</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Yeah, Mike, so for this particular update, we&#39;re going to be adding a, a rotation sketch.

So, in Google Drive under metrics organized, executive assistant projects, I&#39;ve added a new folder called bookkeeping and there is a file here.
This is meant to capture different expenses that we have on a monthly basis that is not salary. It should be everything else except for salary and what I want you to do is if you look at this second folder called statements it&#39;s going to have two.
Files here. And then. This has. A few different files here. Just combine these for you. Okay, so we got one file in here.
Okay, so we got one file in here. Okay, I have two files, one for the bank account and one for the credit card.
What I&#39;d like you to do is review both files and then go into this.. It&#39;s file and essentially for wherever we have a digital ocean payment.
. Can say. Okay. You can see that it&#39;s called. Okay. Digital ocean. And for May.. We have 12. Hi. If you hold down the control button and click on it, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s total six thousand eighty eight thirty one cents.
So that would be. Six thousand. Thirty eight. Eighty one cents. So I want I want us to update. This for.
. And after we updated it, we can say. Five minus six all right. And I&#39;ll put this on the both files.
You can see here sometimes it&#39;s getting holding. I&#39;ll take a look at the second column. Yeah, so what we want to do is for both of these files I&#39;d like you to update the totals for each item here.
And. Then if you see, if you see something that you don&#39;t recognize, you can just let me know. And anything that you update, you can add, turn the chat.
And then I will review it to see if anything that we&#39;re missing. Okay, and then, so we&#39;re gonna do this for January, February, March, April.
And. May, we will do it at the end of the month.

So a couple of minor, minor things that I wanted to bring you, bring to your attention as a small you.
Actually tweak ideas when I first came in here I clicked into this field and I didn&#39;t realize this was a dropdown.
So. So unless someone goes in here and clicks on this icon, they&#39;re not. Gonna know that this has a lot of great options in here.
So for new users, it would help if this is a dropdown or at least if I click into this, the menu opens up.
Another thing that I noticed is that I wrote an email template and this is what it looks like for action items that I want to summarize.
And if I go to my conversations, and let&#39;s say this one here, email, click this, generate email. Alright, that one&#39;s taking a little longer than expected.
Let&#39;s see if I had one that, So, one feature that will be helpful, is for us to specify certain type of insight or email template that we always want to preload.
So, for example, we&#39;re going to need to send out meeting summaries for, all of our onboarding meetings and instead of having to wait for it to generate, nice if I come in here, it&#39;s already generated, and I&#39;m able to use it.
So it doesn&#39;t have to be for all the templates and all the insights because I know, it costs money to generate these things, but if we can specify one of the templates as our default template or primary template, and then that would generate it.
Or for insights, it&#39;s specifying one of the, like the long summaries or short summaries and generate that by default. Because otherwise we&#39;re stuck here.
And we&#39;ll come back. And maybe this is already a planned item. At some point it would be great for us to have folders.
So if we have conversations that are onboarding and we can create client folders and put those conversations. In there. So for enterprise clients, it&#39;s we talked to them multiple times during the year.
It&#39;d be nice for us to have the client&#39;s conversation all organized in one, one folder. And what I wanted to show you was something that I noticed when I was looking at the email template.
If for some reason it was working great and at the bottom of that email that it generated, it also showed some of the raw transcript.
I&#39;m not sure why that was happening if it was something that I did wrong on the template. But it was.
Let me see if I can pull it up for a screenshot. Let me see if this works. So you can see here that I got the summary of the list of action items.
And then I also have a bunch of. Raw content from the transcript. So it&#39;s either a bug or there&#39;s a problem with my prompt here.
That&#39;s preventing it from working properly. So I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on this and all the other things that I mentioned as ideas and features.
They&#39;re not urgent. I know I&#39;m simply suggesting ideas for the future. It would be helpful if we can figure out this problem.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eaa7fdd44764420dac633803143423df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 15 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mitch. So we added this new permission and I&#39;m gonna turn this on for your account. But we, I would want you to test this with a someone that does.
That have Advent access. But for this example, I&#39;m gonna use your account. And then if I go to manage evaluations, and then we can turn on some of these templates.
And then we&#39;re gonna turn on these roles. Save. And then now. If I go to Users. Actually this is something that you won&#39;t be able to do on your end, But I&#39;m just going to access the account.
As your portal. And then if I go to Review, Evaluations, we will see evaluations that were submitted. Using those templates that we set up.
And on this, I can view. The status. And I can also review and sign here. So one of the things.
But this is also showing is the way to add a grade. But we&#39;re not using that functionality. But you can see that the review does show up.
We may need to decide if we want to hide this at grade. But for now, even if it&#39;s showing, it&#39;s not going to be able to do much.
You may hear my son Alexander in the background. He wants to learn about metrics. So yeah, so in order for us to deploy this, we&#39;re doing some testing.
But I wanted to Chris is working on some testing, but I want to create this video for you so you can take a look at it too.
My recommendation is to go to the admin portal and then go to permissions, set up the permissions for someone that is a course mentor, and then go to the user.
But because it&#39;s The local API, because it&#39;s a Martord&#39;s page. Arkinhours page or like create a new user called course mentor, 25% so that you Mandalore can use it for testing.
And then log in as that person after you give them permissions and make sure they&#39;re seeing everything. And it&#39;s best to test it as a course.
Mentor that doesn&#39;t have admin portal because this is a permissions update that we&#39;re doing. And we want to make sure that the permissions that we added is getting applied to the personal portal and not to the admin portal.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7edd357e4acb4cc28f8db1c69a3849a3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Issue navigator - Jira - 10 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so for, to set up this filter, what you need to do is go into Issues, and then go to Advanced Search.

So growth ops and status is going to be to do in progress or priority. I mean, not current user. You want to choose an individual and then add, it&#39;s going to be to do in progress or priority.
So, we&#39;re going to do a query. So, we&#39;re going to do so the problem is like, it&#39;s probably gonna be that if someone wants, if someone adds a task that is not part of the OKR or onboarding, is it going to show up on there?
Like, like I just add a random task. I want to make sure that in addition to the OKRs and onboarding tasks, my random task also shows up.
So if if we can set the filters up that way so that all your OKRs that are in any of the statuses except for done shows up.
All of us, all of the tasks for onboarding that is not done. Shows up and anything that I have set for today&#39;s priority.
If that&#39;s not going to work, what we can do is get rid of the today&#39;s priority status and turn that into a category.
Then we can just use to do in progress and done and then people can just put things into a category of today&#39;s priority.
And that actually that I think that makes sense more sense anyway. So what I will do is create a new category.
Well, it gets a little more complicated because if people want to use the small, medium, and large that&#39;s not going to work with the category.
So, I don&#39;t know if people are still using that. So, you can think about this and see if you want to come up with a simple process that works.
Ideally, I want to be able to see. Everything that I have planned out for the day.

So at the top, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s an admin portal and an institutional portal. And if we give someone institutional administrator access, they&#39;ll have access to the institutional portal.
If they&#39;re given access to the program admin portal, they&#39;re given access to the admin portal. All users have access to a personal portal where they can view and complete certain tasks.
We can give specific access to certain modules using the personal portal. So, for example, if you have a course faculty member that needs to be reviewing certain curriculum materials, We can give them access to the curriculum module with, access to that course, and they will view that using the
personal portal. Let&#39;s go to the system setup permissions page, and here we will see that there is a button at the top right called new custom permission for a specific person.
Here I can select an individual, select Alec, and this first one is indicating that there are going to be a calendar administrator.
We don&#39;t need to do that for most of the UME users. This is me. This is me. It&#39;s mainly used for our GME clients that have access to the calendar for scheduling various didactic lectures, and often for chief residents.
Block schedule administrator gives view only access to the full block schedule or edit access to all block schedules. So these two can also be skipped for UME.
When we get down to the manage users for site groups, documents and so on, that&#39;s where we&#39;re setting up the UME permissions.
And for example, if I enable this and select a site called metrics hospital west and select a specific role such as preceptor, this is saying that I can now view all users that have the home institution of metrics hospital west.
So students in metrics, their home institution is going to be the university, the medical school. So they&#39;re, a home institution of metrics hospital west, but they can be scheduled for a month at metrics hospital west.
So this permission will look at both the home institution and any users that are scheduled to be at a specific.
Site that we have defined here and then display those in a page called directory for that administrator. So if Alec is logging in, he will see a directory page on the left menu and that&#39;ll show all users with home institution of metrics hospital west.
And all students that are scheduled to metrics hospital west. There&#39;s a second setting here that says select which roles can be assigned to the users that are created.
So if I choose preceptor, this means Alec can create new users. And the only role that he can select will be preceptor.
So essentially they can, this is giving Alec the ability to create new preceptors in metrics that will be linked to that particular home institution.
So the home institution for. This preceptor will be metrics hospital west. The user profile access allows Alec to open up the profiles of any users that he has access to.
So any student that is scheduled there or any preceptor that is. That has a home institution of metrics hospital west.
This permission will allow Alec to look at all the training details and demographic information for those profiles. Next we have manage groups for this site on the users page in the admin portal.
We can create new groups and those groups can be linked to specific sites. And if we enable these permissions, it allows the local administrators to manage the groups by adding and removing people from that.
Next, we have manage students personal documents. If we enable this functionality, we can define students and their roles so that a site administrator can access their personal documents.
If you have a medical student that is going to a particular hospital and they need to see the immunization records and HIPAA certification, those documents may be uploaded to the students profile.
But by enabling this checkbox, the local site coordinators will be able to see and download those files from their profile or under the managed documents page on the documents menu item.
So on the left menu they have documents and under that there&#39;s a sub menu item called managed documents. Next is Ivan.
And then we have the same concept. Same concept applies here. We&#39;re giving them access to view evaluations for students that are scheduled to that rotation at that hospital or individuals that have a home institution that is set as that particular rotation for that site.
So if I choose metrics hospital west and I enable this permission, then I&#39;ll be able to see evaluations for users that are scheduled to that site or individuals that have a home institution as that site.
Case logs, same. If I enable this, choose metrics hospital west, I&#39;ll be able to see all evaluations that are logged for that site and then manage that and make sure everything is completed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/02e3496d407f4c0f98b63403735ace62</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 24 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so this page shows all of the users by default.

So I can go to the second page, now you can see that everything came back. I can&#39;t go to the second page on a filter result because it resets everything.
So even though I have OMS1 here, it&#39;s showing all the users in the system. Same thing if I search here and search for John.
Okay, you can see how there&#39;s seven pages. Click. Well, it&#39;s working, but it&#39;s not filtered by all MS. So notice how once I, if I search for J.
I hit seven pages of data and then I apply the filter. Or MS three. Come down to two pages. And if I click two, now goes back to seven pages.
So it&#39;s, it removes the filter once I click on the pages at the bottom.

So, under evaluations, templates, we have the ability to create various types of evaluation forms.
One of the evaluation forms we can create here is the new rotation based evaluations and then click, uh, type in a name.
A name should be descriptive and allow anyone else that is using the platform to identify what this form will be used for.
So let&#39;s call this end of clerkship or let&#39;s say end of clinical. Patient evaluation of student. So it&#39;s also good to be descriptive of who will be evaluated.
I can write a description if I want to that will provide more instruction to the evaluator. So this description field.
The second field on this page and it allows, um, whatever we show here or right here will be displayed at the top of the form when the evaluator is completing it.
Next field on the activation date. The activation date is used to tell metrics when this form should start assigning.
So whatever date you set here, that&#39;s when metrics will start checking the schedules to see if evaluation assignment should be made.
If you want evaluations to be assigned for past clinical rotations, you can set this date back and it&#39;ll pick up past rotations.
Typically, it&#39;s done by leaving it for us today&#39;s date when we want this, the form to become activated. We&#39;ll be covering some of these other items in a different video, so I&#39;ll skip over that.
_____ On the Manage Questions tab is where we can create different types of questions. _____ For clinical evaluations, you can write your _____.
_____ On the Manage Questions tab is where we can create different types of questions.
Create them and then import it to the form on the Manage Questions tab. There&#39;s also a way to import competencies.
So if you&#39;re created standard set of competencies or if you&#39;re an ACG ME accredited training program that&#39;s using the ACG ME as milestones, those can be imported.
onto the form here. Then let&#39;s go to the last tab which is going to be the Set Assignment Rules. The Assignment Rules tab will allow us to set what type of automa- ization we want to do with this clinical evaluation template.
To complete this, we have to answer a few questions. What&#39;s being evaluated? So for this rotation I can choose self, the rotation, or people in the rotation.
Self evaluation is if I&#39;m going to be evaluating, I&#39;m going to be asking the evaluator to evaluate themselves. The rotation evaluation means that someone is going to be evaluating the rotation experience.
People in the rotation means that we&#39;re going to be asking people to evaluate each other. So that could be the trainee evaluating the faculty or the preceptor or the trainee getting evaluated by one of the educators.
There will be a faculty or a preceptor. What rotations do we want to include? Here&#39;s where we can see all the rotations that are available at our, in our, in our program.
And I can enable one or two or I can enable all of them. There&#39;s also a search bar that can be used to search for rotations.
Who should complete this form? This section is used to select the roles, groups who will act as evaluators. The other thing to remember here is there&#39;s also an include rotation supervisors option.
If this is enabled, it&#39;s going to pull in all the supervisors of faculty members that are linked to the rotations that we have selected.
So, who will complete this form? If you&#39;re using a rotation based evaluation where the, you have added supervisors to the rotation, you want to make sure it&#39;s very important that you turn this check box on.
And the other option is select, choose to assign using roles. So if I come down here. And choose preceptor.
This means that anyone with the role of preceptor. Will. Will serve as evaluator.
Or this training program. Who will be evaluated. Here&#39;s where we can select which individuals Will act as evaluators. And again we have roles, groups.
And the ability to select rotation supervisors as evaluators. Down here if I choose roles. Pgy123 that means those individuals will be acting as trainees.
If I choose groups. In either of these sections I also have the ability to select a bunch of groups um, that I have added to the system earlier.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/59d82ed64f674bd2a906d7bbcb111c88</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Evaluations</pre></td><td><pre>Metrics Evaluations Module is one of the more popular modules used by medical schools, nursing school, residency programs, fellowship programs, and allied health professionals.
The module contains all of the different types of evaluations that needs to be used for a training program. Evaluations and assessments are an integral part of medical education, nursing education, as well as professional graduate medical education.
Evaluations serve two purposes. One is it helps maintain accreditation and fulfill the requirements from the national accrediting body. However, the more important part of evaluation, or the the more important reason why.
One of the most important training programs conducted by evaluations is to ensure that the trainees are getting adequate tran- uh, uh, um, ensure that the trainees are getting appropriate training and graduating as competent nurses or physicians.
In metrics, the evaluation modules contains- the evaluation module contains a few different, uh, sub-menu items. On the templates page, we have the ability to- to curate various templates.
Here we can review the different type of training program, uh, different types of forms that we offer. Each form is tied to a different automation rule and uses a different type of schedule to send those out to the- the trainees, faculty members, preceptors, and so.
So, what? The course-based evaluation is used to collect feedback on classroom-based courses. The session evaluation is used to collect feedback on individual lectures, labs, and small group sessions that take- that make up a course.
Rotation-based evaluation is used to collect feedback on- clinical rotations, clerkships, and other clinical experiences. We have the program evaluation, which collects feedback on the overall training program.
The event-based eval is used to collect feedback on the calendar events. And often in medical school, these are one-off events in residency programs.
They may be didactic lectures or other topics that they&#39;re covering for the trainees. The general survey form type used to collect feedback from an individual, but not necessarily evaluating someone.
And it sometimes used to collect self feedback. Institution. No evaluations are used by institutional administrators. To collect feedback on the overall institution.
When evaluations are assigned. They are sent to the trainees, faculty members and preceptors. Via email. Um, using a link that they can click on and complete the form without having to sign in.
All assigned evaluations are tracked on the assignments page on the admin portal. So there are various filters on this page that can be used to find.
And then we can incorporate a evaluation and track if it was completed. The trainees and faculty members, the educators and trainees can also log into metrics and complete their evaluations.
They can also view evaluations that were completed on them. In their portal. There are various reports that come with metrics for evaluations and these can be met on the reports page.
And in addition to the standard reports, we also handle competency based evaluations. And these competency based evaluations have the. More reports on the performance page that could be used to track various comfort competencies longitudinally.
Metrics also in. It includes permissions under system set up and permissions that can be used to assign.
Evaluation permissions to different administrators. Well, not necessarily administrators to non-admins to access various types of evaluations. And in the next few videos, we&#39;ll be covering each of these topics in more detail.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1ebf42459d5f4124b69349bdac383db7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSU Academic Progress - Google Sheets - 9 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this report is going to be for the Gradebook Academic Progress and it&#39;s going to be a way for us to click a Export to Excel or Excel button on the right side.
And this one. This will generate an export of all the students that are shown on that page. We&#39;ll also have this on the personal portal so if a student looks at it and click Export, they will be able to export the data for one program.
And, let&#39;s take a look at. What that looks like. So if I go to this program here. Gradebook academic progress and we have this information here.
And we&#39;ll add a Excel button here to export all this data. And what we want to do is. Add last name, first name.
Role, employee ID.. Let&#39;s put an ID at two. Most of the time it&#39;s going to be student. This is going to be the employee ID in our back end.
The email address. And then these are going to be total weeks or credits for different. Categories. So I&#39;m gonna need to update this all to say weeks slash credits.
And let&#39;s look at what that looks. Like here, if I expand this, we&#39;ll see different categories. We&#39;ll keep. We look at MSU easier for us to see this.
So, academic progress. And if I expand one of these, we&#39;ll see that there&#39;s categories. And inside of these categories are different rotations.
That are linked to it. So, under setup, we&#39;ll see categories and subcategories underneath that. So, I expand core and I&#39;ll see a bunch of, rotations underneath it.
If I expand elective, I&#39;ll see a bunch of, rotations underneath it. And we&#39;ll also see that these rotations are mapped, to rotations in system setup.
If I go here, you can see that, edit this, and this is mapped to a great book rotation. Each of these site-specific rotations, so addiction medicine, is linked to Michigan State, and you&#39;ll see that on sites, we have a status of internal or external.
So, to review, relationship, we have grade book, grade course rotations that are added to different categories and subcategories. Those rotations are linked to, the rotations in system setup which are linked to sites and sites have a status of internal or external.
And here, what we&#39;re doing is for each category and subcategory we&#39;re totaling the total number of weeks or credits. So a category can be either defined as total credits or total, weeks and that is done in setup, edit.
We can say that if it&#39;s a rotation category it&#39;ll be in weeks. Course category it&#39;ll be in credits. So if I have a student that is scheduled to, a subcategory and it has a bunch of like several rotations each of those rotations are linked to some internal sites and some external sites we&#39;re gonna first
show the totals for each subcategory and based on what they&#39;re scheduled and then add that up to get the category total for internal and then for external and then the overall category total.
So again to review we have electives. And these are two subcategories inside of it. We have a set of rotations that are in here.
And these rotations are mapped to the rotations in system setup. And those are scheduled on the. Block schedule. And we&#39;re getting the total number of weeks from what the student is scheduled to on the block schedule.
And adding that together for external sites, add. And then putting that total onto the subcategory external site total number of weeks.
And then for internal sites that we&#39;re scheduled to, we&#39;ll have a total here and. Both these categories for internal added together will give us the internal category total.
Both of these external category totals give us the external category. And then finally, all four added up together will give us the category total.
One thing to notice, this internal and external only applies for rotations. And for any courses that I&#39;m mapped to where we&#39;re adding up credits, we&#39;re going to add up credits.
We&#39;re going to simply show that in the internal section and we won&#39;t show the external at all. So if it&#39;s a course, it will be subcategory, total number of credits.
That is going to be displayed here. The internal and then we&#39;ll have the internal total and then the overall total.
I know this is a complicated report. One thing that I want to also point out is the most of our clients are only using this for weeks and for totaling up the total number of clinical weeks.
If you want to do that. As first part and then break it up for credit to the separate task. That&#39;s totally fine.
And by the way these categories. We&#39;re not going to call this category and subcategory. We&#39;re going to actually show the names of the actual category.
So it would be elective. That&#39;s what it would show up here. And then this would be non-surgical as a subcategory.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/165e822644fb4933ba11e6dfe405fee5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 23 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>We&#39;re gonna start with an introduction of evaluations module in metrics. The evaluations module is used by all of our clients for collecting various types of feedback.
For our medical school clients, evaluations are used throughout all four years of training to collect feedback on trainees, faculties, the courses, as well as the rotations that the students are going to at different hospitals.
For our residency and. Fellowship programs that are graduate medical education level, they are collecting evaluations for residents as they complete a series various rotations.
They collect evaluations for faculty members, the course, the rotation itself, and on the training program. These evaluations are collected as part of a requirement from the accrediting body, as well as to make sure that the students and the residents are meeting the essential requirements.
So, these are the requirements of becoming a competent healthcare professional. In metrics one more, one more, a couple more things I got to cover is for nursing schools and allied health professionals metrics uses the evaluation module to collect feedback from various preceptors as well as from
faculty members that cover their courses. Some of the allied health professionals also have mentors that the trainees work with and we collect feedback from those mentors on how the trainees are performing.
So, metrics, evaluation, evaluation module allows the training program to create various templates and these templates are customized to the program&#39;s needs.
We have a full evaluation builder that allows the training program to create various types of questions and then. We can assign them automatically to the appropriate people based on the schedules that the training program has.
So this could be classroom based schedules or hospital based clinical schedules. The evaluations module is managed on the admin portal.
And on the admin portal, We have evaluations and then templates. This is where all of the evaluation templates are created.
And then activated and then once the activation happens, evaluations are sent out based on the student residence or residence schedules.
Once evaluation, ..email notifications are scheduled, email notifications are also sent from the system and various individuals are asked to complete those evaluations using those links in the email.
The evaluators do not have to sign in to complete the evaluation. They can click, they can simply click on the link and, fill out the form and submit it.
Every evaluation that is assigned for metrics is organized on the assignments page for the administrators to track them. So the assignments page which has a date range that says create a date and, start and end date.
And by default it goes to the current academic period and it shows you all the evaluations that were assigned from, on this training program.
Evaluations also come with various reports that can be managed on the reports page. This includes a summary report, ability to export a raw evaluation data, status report, compliance report, as, as well as various competency reports.
The competency reports are mostly found on the performance page. This includes the competency report, the CCC report competency graphs, scatter plot, and reviews.
In addition to having these reports, Metrix also provides various permissions that institutions can use to give administrators, administrators and other staff members access to evaluations.
So in future articles we&#39;ll be going into how to set up these permissions. But this can be used to grant different individuals access to permissions for trainees.
So, evaluations module. Is a complex, complex module that can be used to automate various types of forms. And we&#39;re going to take a brief look at the different types of evaluations that we offer.
We use core space, ,space evaluations, which is used to collect feedback from classroom-based training. We have session evaluation, which goes with classroom-based evals to collect feedback on individual lectures, labs, and small groups.
We have sessions that comprise, that make up a course. Then we have rotation-based evaluation for collecting feedback on the clinical, rotations that the students and the residents complete.
These are clerkships and electives in medical schools, in nursing schools they are practicum courses, and in residency and event based evals, so event based evals are for calendar events that are not necessarily tied to curricular content.
Or they are, in a medical school they are one off events such as orientation, in residence. So in the CVM fellowship programs the calendar may also contain didactics and their events, those didactic events can be evaluated using our events template.
Then we have program evaluations, this is meant to collect evaluation on the entire training program itself. So, and then lastly institutional evals for institutional administrators.
So to review course-based eval, session-based eval, rotation eval, and program eval. And lastly we have a general survey which can be done with, you&#39;re not evaluating anyone or anything, you&#39;re simply completing a survey.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cdd3567a36794dcd8f39146ee5e709e3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Meeting w/ Rachel Gee</pre></td><td><pre>So if you go to questions and then once you&#39;re on this page, you&#39;ll see all of the different questions that are on your values and forms.
Yep. That&#39;s thinking still. Sorry, I&#39;m clearly not home. So I&#39;m like hanging off my phone and on a note. Okay.
We&#39;re used to working in different places to actually work in the same way. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think it&#39;s gonna.
Okay. So under these are all questions that are in your program and these include questions that were created on templates, but also questions that were created in a question bank because when you have a set of questions that you want to share across multiple forms.
And import them into different different forms. So your program has created these categories of questions called observable behaviors. So at the top right, there&#39;s a category of filter.
And if you search for observable behaviors in that category. And this one is type in observable behavior and filter down.
So let&#39;s do like level one observable behavior. These are 62 level one observable behaviors that your program has written and has standardized to be used across many forms.
So if the first question to answer is, is the program now changing what they&#39;re tracking as observable behaviors or. Are you adding new ones to this list?
Because if you&#39;re renaming or changing something, then we have to manage that in the question bank here because that&#39;s supposedly standardized questions that are being used.
If you are adding new ones, then you want to add them here and then import them to a new form.
Or the third option is, is the new form that the program director gave you. Is, is that form simply using existing.
Observable behaviors that you&#39;re just mixing and matching differently. So and I can&#39;t answer that question. I was literally just given a word doc and said, these are the questions we want.
Like can you put this in. Can you send this out. And so that&#39;s what I thought I was doing. Yeah.
I don&#39;t know. Yeah. You were in level. Where those questions came from. Yeah. You don&#39;t have you. You were given the document, but you don&#39;t have the full context.
On how all of this is structured. And we&#39;re on the same boat because we got the question of like, how do you.
And the answer of like duplicating is correct for programs that are. Not doing this kind of structure. And, but when we&#39;re doing this kind of structure.
We have to really look at these questions and decide. Are we changing the standardized set of observable behaviors. Because you, these are sort of like standardized competencies that you have defined.
And are you reusing for every single form. And you don&#39;t want to make these changes on a temple level. There should be updated in the question bank.
So let&#39;s look at one of those questions. Can you give me one question that on the new form and let&#39;s type it into that search field and see if we can find it.
In the, sorry, so a question that was a new one that was given to me. Yeah, let&#39;s clear that category filter at the top and because this is only showing level one observable behavior.
We&#39;ll just clear that. And then I want you to type in one of the new questions. And I want to see if it&#39;s already in here.
Okay, obviously. , , , th a the template that I know is going to I&#39;m going to read it to you so I found that template and it&#39;s going to be communicates clear expectations and timely comma appropriate information.
You can just type that into that search field there and so type in and category or okay I&#39;m going to type in communicates clear expectations.
Okay let&#39;s scroll down there and see the fourth one. It&#39;s a level one observable behavior and if you scroll down is it anywhere else?
No. Okay so it&#39;s only in there once what that means what it was telling me is that when you renamed that on the new copy it renamed the original observable behavior and what we need to do is change that back to the original form.
So like after I got off the call with you I was looking at I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t have it copy off the original template.
Yeah. What the community medicine one was called? Yeah. I don&#39;t have that available. I could have gotten it if I&#39;d known I needed it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/30081a9484c54551ac8ea9b3db9f44ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Custom evaluation questions part 2</pre></td><td><pre>On this page, we can now import questions that are part of the the competencies that I want to include on this forum.
So if I click import question, I&#39;m able to import custom questions that I&#39;ve created in the question bank. If I click import competency, this is the question bank.
This is actually gonna let you import standardized competencies or milestones that were loaded, preloaded into metrics such as the ACGME&#39;s milestones.
Or I can create a new competency question or, or a narrative directly on the form. Since we already created a question on the question bank.
I&#39;m gonna click that and then come down and find my question which is patient care, history, and physical examination. And I&#39;ll go ahead and add that.
And we. Have created that new question here. And depending on how long you&#39;ve been using metrics, you may have a lot of questions in here and sometimes it helps to search to narrow that.
Results down.. And then you can also use the system generated is no, which means that it&#39;s not something that was preloaded and it&#39;s custom created.
And you can also choose the type as competency. To find the specific question. So once it&#39;s been added, we can go ahead and publish it and make that available to the residents as part of their their evaluation.
So the second way for us to create questions on here, besides adding it to the question bank and then importing it, is to create that directly on the form.
To do that, I would create new narrative or EPA and then this will choose a subcompetency or competency. And we would do the same exact thing that we did on the question bank.
Instead of creating those questions in the question bank, I&#39;m building that directly on the form. These questions are not going to be available to be imported into other forms.
We would simply use it on this form and the next time we create a new form, we&#39;d have to recreate it in a second question.
So the first step when we&#39;re creating a new set of forms is to decide, are we going to be creating the same questions on multiple forms?
If so, create those questions in the question bank first, and then import them to the form. If our forms are unique and they don&#39;t have shared questions, then we would be creating the same questions on multiple forms.
It&#39;s easier to go to the form itself and create those questions like we&#39;re doing here. So we&#39;ll do the same thing on this form.
Question. Question. Question. And then. And then. And then. Level 1. Hi, Jim. It&#39;s actually kind of the levels. Thank you very much.
Alright, this has been a review of how to create custom milestone questions or competency questions in metrics and pull them, create them onto.
They, an evaluation template that&#39;ll be used to assess their trainees.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/668eb2204c6b424cb0d9ce68710b22b3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>How to Advance Students and Residents to a New Program in the Same Institution</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at how to add a student to your program if the student is progressing as a resident.
Same process also applies to any resident that is continuing into another program as a fellow in the same at the same institutions.
So if you are a administrator for family medicine program here then you have a resident, you have a newly matched resident that used to be a medical student in your program.
The first thing that you have to do is find that student&#39;s account. So it&#39;s always best practice to search for all new residents and fellows in metrics to see if they have an account.
And you can search for by their first name, last name and or email address. So if I want to find, for example, Cole, who used to be a medical student at this institution.
I click affiliate and now Cole will be added to my program here so that I can work with his account.
Then if I want to update his profile. I&#39;ll click edit demographics and then go to unlock this field to change the user&#39;s role in home institution.
And the first thing that we want to do is update the home institution to the current home institution which is our institution and then change the role to either going to be an incoming resident if it&#39;s in the just after the match or if it&#39;s after July 1st you may be using PGY1s.
So update that. And one important thing to note here is we also want to update the expected graduation year to the year that the resident will be graduating from residency and also if the resident about this if the medical student is in another rotated program at the same institution let&#39;s say they&#39;re
currently at that doing a fourth year rotation if you change their role then it may impact the other coordinator so you always want to make sure that if the student account is getting updated that student is not currently rotating at your institution it&#39;s 6 30 and this also applies to our residents
that are continuing as a fellow if you have a resident that is in a pgy3 year and they&#39;re going to be starting their fellowship year in july right after the match they are still part of that residency program so you always want to coordinate with the other coordinator other program coordinator and make
sure that they&#39;re aware of any changes that you&#39;ll be making so best practice for that scenario is to keep that resident as pgy3 but make the affiliation to your program for the fellowship so that you can set up data and then on july 1st switch the role from pgy3 to fellowship year so for medical students
if they&#39;re no longer at the institution you can always update it as soon as they become a matched resident for fellows make the affiliation and then update the role on july 1st and once we have this updated we can save it and we&#39;re good to go and this is a always something that you want to do as part
of the eras match matching process once a resident&#39;s account is brought into metrics through eras you can look up all of the incoming residents in metrics to see if they already have accounts if they do do not create a second account simply add that account to your program and change their role if they
don&#39;t have an account in metrics you can use the eras integration to create a new account for that person</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/619955af2e464fa885efa207b44034ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Finding Clinical Education Contacts 👨‍⚕️</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mark.

This often includes the ACGMEs, milestones, or any custom competency set that was loaded for your program as part of onboarding.
When we created that question in the question bank and put it into a category, that is a custom question that you&#39;ll be importing.

You can import, you can add Chris&#39;s calendar to the left by going to your calendar. And then click the let&#39;s see.
I think you gotta go to setting. Okay. Add a calendar. Yeah, you can go to add a calendar. Calendar and then select other team members.
So it&#39;s good to have everybody&#39;s calendar available on the left side. So if you go to Chris&#39;s calendar and. Then click on.
Day. Yeah, there&#39;s a list view. Let&#39;s. See. Should we go here and search for Purdue? You&#39;ll see that these are all the different Meetings that we had in the past.
Asked for Purdue. So what I&#39;d like you to do is so you can see December 20 22nd up to today and put this into a new spreadsheet.
And then what I&#39;d like you to do is for each of these meetings, create a separate column where we will have the total time for each of these meetings.
So.. Eating before and afterwards and any tasks. So let&#39;s do that for Purdue. And then afterwards, we&#39;ll also do that for high com.
So you can see that high comm is started in November. And actually from March 6th. So each client that we&#39;re going to do an onboarding total for, we can put them into separate sheets on the Google sheet.
So I&#39;ll show you how to do that. Under assistant projects. And let&#39;s do onboarding hours. You can create an, I&#39;ll create, I&#39;ll start the sheet for you.
So the first. The second one would be for, for due. Second one would be for KICOM. And then you can essentially go in here and if you highlight it like this.
You&#39;ll be able to paste it in here. Actually it&#39;s not pasting us. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a, Yeah, so it&#39;s not going to paste properly, so, We will need to manually put it into separate columns.
So once you paste it, it would have to be a time. You&#39;ve got name couple hours. Total minutes, and then we can tally it up.
Let me know if you have any questions. We&#39;re going to be doing that for each of our clients so that we can get a total number of time, total number of minutes that they used up.
Each client is getting 25 hours of meetings. So we have to make sure that we&#39;re not going over that. Ohh!!</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/86a8cfc6f74f4f9abe20589bee45cc9e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>How to manage advancement of trainees to different programs in same institution</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at how to handle residents that are graduating from a training program and staying at the same institution for a fellowship.
So when a resident is graduating, they will find out in the, during the match that they are going to be staying at the same institution, which means that they have to be moved over to a different program for onboarding as well as for starting their new training.
So let&#39;s say the match happens in March, then March till July, end of June, they&#39;re going to have to be affiliated with the residency program and the fellowship program.
So it&#39;s important. For the two programs to coordinate and make sure that the, the roles are not updated too early because metrics relies on the user&#39;s role to make various assignments such as evaluations case logs as well as the schedules.
So the first thing is, let&#39;s say we&#39;re dealing with an internal medicine resident that is graduating and continuing into a hematology oncology fellowship.
So that resident may be in the fellowship coordinator has to do is go into metrics and affiliate that trainee with the new program.
That can be done using the affiliate people with the program option here. And then we can find the insertion find.
That fellow. So let&#39;s see if we look for. We&#39;re going to pick this PGY. Three fellow here affiliate. When we write this this message is for lay.
When we write this article, we want to make sure we. Get a better screenshot of this. So let&#39;s say we affiliated that fellow with this program.
What we want to do is avoid changing the fellows role until July 1st because the fellow needs to be PGY three in the residency program.
Until they finish their training and then once the trainee has finished their residency, they can advance to the FY one or fellowship year one role.
So the residency program coordinator will not be able to advance that trainee to the FY one role because the FY one role is not available.
So they can also use that trainee to the FY one role. So the fellowship coordinator will be able to change that role, but it should only be done on July 1st and it can either be done manually by opening up a fellows account.
So if I click edit demographics on a user, I can scroll down. I can unlock this field to change the role and I can advance that to the fellowship year one role.
If the trainee is if there are multiple fellows that are coming into the program, the metrics trainee advancement feature can be used to advance the role in a batch.
So I can select multiple re-residents that I have affiliated with my program, and then select the day that they&#39;re going to be changing to the FY1 role.
So in the fellowship program, we&#39;ll still have them as PGY3 until the end of June, and then manually change their role to, fellowship year one for July 1st, or have an automation rule entered in training advancement to change their role from PGY3 to fellowship year one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/151a864808ff4061974cf415879d6f40</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 14 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at how to set up metrics for collecting attendance and how that will work from the training or faculty side.
So on the program admin calendar, when we create an event, let&#39;s say this is going to be a orientation meeting, orientation meeting, and we&#39;ll call this meeting.
I&#39;m going to invite. All of the students and we&#39;ll have the track attendance enabled. And for this example. Noon. And click save.
Yes, I want to invite everybody. And right now it is 1054. So this event should be happening. So the way that the QR code based attendance collection works is if the track attendance is enabled.
A trainee or anybody that&#39;s invited to this event will be able to check in 15 minutes before the meeting starts until 15 minutes, until 15 minutes after the meeting ends.
So if it&#39;s 10 a.m. To 12 p.m., it&#39;ll be, 945 till 1.15 p.m. Is a check-in window. And if they check in during that time frame, their attendance will be taken.
If they try to check in before that or afterwards, it will not accept that check-in. They will be receiving a message that says, it&#39;s too late.
To check in or too early to check in. If the student checks in late, I believe it was 15 minutes into the meeting.
So let&#39;s say they check in at 10 10.30, they will be marked late. And that, that from 10.30 till 12.15, they will be marked late.
And but these, these check-ins can be adjusted by the admin on the admin portal if needed. So let&#39;s take a look at that.
So each calendar has a QR code that can be saved. So you click, right click on this or you click download, download QR code and print it out and put it in your conference room.
And when the trainee is coming to lecture, they will see that QR code in the room, point their phone at it, and then they&#39;ll be able to sign in for that event.
And I want to correct something that I said earlier. It&#39;s actually 30 minutes before the. Event not 15 minutes. And when they scan the QR code, the trainee will be taken to this page.
And on this page, click check in. And let&#39;s log out here. I&#39;ve logged out, and it&#39;s gonna say check in, please enter an email address, and.
Okay, let&#39;s try something else.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3e65b7f71ac3492c96b969dcaba03621</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Block Schedule - How to set up view only permissions for external administrators?</pre></td><td><pre>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at how to set up view only access for external coordinators. So if we go to schedules, clinical schedules.
We have a student schedule that we have set up. Click edit. And then if we scroll down to the bottom, we&#39;ll have a section called view only access.
And here we can give view only access to the schedule as a role or as a. Individuals so we have all of the external coordinators as a role of site coordinator or some other role that groups all the external coordinators into one.
Now, one group, we could use the role permission to grant everybody access. Otherwise, what we would have to do is select each of the site coordinators here and give them access as individuals.
So when we have a lot of external coordinators and we have one big schedule, the role is going to be the easier way to grant that permission.
Once we set that up, we could also. Turn on this checkbox here, which. Is labeled only show schedule details for sites that you, that the user has permission to view.
What this checkbox does is, is a limit the site name and rotation name that a person. Can view. So let&#39;s say you have hospital X and the hospital access rotation.
A, if a site level administrator is looking at the schedule. He or she will only be able to see rotations from.
Hospital X. So they may see rotation a rotation, B rotation C, as long as they are from hospital X, they would not be able to see the names of other sites and rotations of other sites.
Those other sites will be simply be labeled outside hospital or outside site and the rotations will be labeled. So this is a way to prevent site administrators from seeing where the student is coming from and where the student is going next after they leave the hospital.
And then there&#39;s one more permission that can be used. For view only access under system setup permissions. If we click new custom permission for a specific person and I select an individual there is permission called block schedule administrator.
If I turn that on I can give view access or edit access. This permission gives this individual that I selected full access to all block schedules.
So if I&#39;m choosing edit and give block schedule administrator if I have five different block schedules in my program. Maria here will be able to access all five schedules and edit them.
If I change this to view she&#39;ll be able to view all five schedules in my program and see who&#39;s on that schedule and their assignments.
So this is more of a global access to schedules and the other permission that we went over earlier is for permissions on an individual schedule.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/268fc35b8496438d9ef3b4c3cc3b16c3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 12 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Marcus and Mike. So for this request change functionality, it&#39;s really a major upgrade to the platform. Not in, the size of the feature or the impact that it&#39;ll have for medical schools.
And I&#39;m going to send an email introducing you to the coordinators at MSU so we can schedule, a time to meet with them and get their insight into this and try to work that into a case study and or video that we can publish.
So, let me see if I can find MSU-COM elective student handbook. So, this is their, well. That doesn&#39;t work. See if we can find anything else.
So essentially how it works is the students in the fourth year are given a certain number of months where they are allowed to do electives in different hospitals.
So for the first half of their clinical training, which happens during the third year, they have to do their core rotations.
These are required. For all medical students, such as internal medicine, pediatrics, OBGYN, general surgery, there are a few core rotations and then after they&#39;re done with their cores, they are allowed to do.
Electives in a specialty or multiple specialties that they are interested in. Because after medical school, they&#39;re going to be choosing to go to a specialty and these electives give them an opportunity to get more experience in this.
And at MSU-COM, they&#39;re allowed to go to any hospital to do these electives. They have to submit an application. They have to have a rotation to get approval to go to that place.
Some of their hospitals that they worked with in the past may already have an agreement and have a rotation. They have to have a rotation to get approval to go to that place.
Whenever a student says, I want to go to hospital X, they would go to that hospital, get approval from the hospital team and send an email to the medical school, clinical department and tell them that they are going here.
This is a paperwork we have signed with them and the medical school staff will review it and the paper agreement, approve it.
And then go to a, their software and update the schedule. For anywhere that&#39;s like outside of the, outside of the network they would have to create the account.
And everything and schedule the student. And then they have to inform the student via email. This process is pretty tedious and when you&#39;re dealing with hundreds of students It&#39;s going to take a lot of coordination.
To keep track of all these emails. And what we have done in Metrix is given them a way to specify which months they have elective time.
And for example, MSU-COM placeholder here is the out time rotation. It&#39;s telling the student that they can take, they can schedule an elective here.
So, when they have these placeholders, the students are aware that&#39;s when they can schedule electives. They would go into the student account here, and they can say, I can request a change of my placeholder and choose which hospital that I&#39;m gonna work with, and then.
For that hospital, they&#39;re able to check if there&#39;s an existing rotation that the MSU team has already added. If so, they can select that rotation and continue, and they can select a su- supervisor at that hospital that they&#39;ll be working as- working under, and then attach a- a- approval form and
submit this to the administrator. When they are when that, uh- request comes to the admin portal, the administrators are able to review it and then approve it.
As soon as they approve it, the schedule gets updated to their new schedule. So it&#39;s a pretty seamless- process, there&#39;s no emails back and forth, they&#39;re able to review it, approve it, and then the student schedule&#39;s updated.
There- that&#39;s for any rotation that&#39;s already in the system. If they- are going to a new hospital that is not in metrics, they&#39;re also able to provide details about that external new site, create and submit an application and- and then the administrators are able to review that and then create
the site, create the rotation and then assign that to the student. So this process is not automated, but they&#39;re still able to get that in one se- central place instead of having to email them back and forth.
So to answer the question. So. Let&#39;s see. How common are these swaps? They&#39;re happening for every student for like I would say 10 to 12 times each year.
So if they have like I think they have around 600 students in their third and fourth year. So out of those 600 students, 300 of them are in their fourth year and 300 students and for swapping out 10 rotations.
Each year that&#39;s 3000 rotation swaps and approvals they have to do for that one school. And this, the reason that they&#39;re, it&#39;s not really, like we have a, we call it rotation swap.
But it&#39;s not really a swap, it&#39;s really an application that initial rotation that&#39;s there is just a placeholder to tell the student that you are going to be allowed to take a elective here and then the student is applying for a specific rotation.
So instead of calling. Applying a rotation swap, it&#39;s better to call it elective application process and then that&#39;s better for marketing.
Okay. Okay. So I hope that helps and let me know if you have any other questions and also send an email introduction to Erin and Elizabeth at MSU.
Those are the two coordinators that helped us test this feature and they can add more insight into the. Internal challenges and it&#39;s it will be good for us to record the call and maybe even do it through Riverside so that.
We could turn that into a case study.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0dbd7dfb11fa47eda29016db39ac465b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (301) - 12 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alejandro, so when you&#39;re reviewing these support issues, you wanna go into the customer support assigned column.

When we add a question, If I choose text, There&#39;s some spacing issues here, text area for long answers, we need to fix that.
And then down here we could remove these subcompetents. Because we no longer let clients map these questions to the subcompetencies.
And then if I&#39;m choosing text area, text field, it doesn&#39;t need to show the options. That&#39;s only for, Checklists of multiple choice.
So that should be hidden. And it looks like if I choose something else, it&#39;s, shh, it&#39;s staying on, the text that I chose.
So that&#39;s something weird. Save that. And then if I go to the template, edit, There&#39;s some bugs here where it&#39;s showing up all the way to the left.
Then we could also show these fields. Expanded by default or show something instead of saying zero selected. It could be primary diagnosis and then a little text is just click.
Expand to see options and then shows how many selected based on what to actually select. So they&#39;re not losing that.
Then if I click add new section. Second new question. This whole thing is too big, which is blocking the button on the KaiCom server.
And I also feel like this section, name and test. Could use some formatting to show that this is a section header and this is questions inside of it.
And the onSelect should be here and instead of onSelect it should be remove, like we do or delete, like we now.
Other places of the system. That&#39;s all I got so far.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4907ceaaa25647ab98cbac59be03568d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 5 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mitch, so under clinical schedules, and if we click edit on one of these schedules, go down to view only access here.
You can select by role or individual, and then where we select will have the only access to this particular schedule.
And then the other thing that you could do here is _____ show only show schedule details for sites the user has permission to view.
_____ show. If you enable that, it would, if you have multiple site schedules on once, block schedule like you do, if someone is looking at it, they will see their schedule, but everything else, all other sites will simply say other site, so they won&#39;t be able to tell which site the student is going
to next. So that&#39;s one way to set up the schedule. BOLI permission, and the other way is under custom permission, you can add new permissions, and then go to, _____ block schedule administrator.
_____ block schedule administrator. _____ block schedule administrator. _____ block schedule administrator. _____ block schedule administrator.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e382dbf558b746bcaffcadd1d5f8b6d9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 12 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Giles, wanted to record a short video to give you a some, some background information on what we&#39;ve been planning the last couple of weeks.
And then I&#39;ll find some time to meet with you to go over more details. If you could update your Google calendar for metrics with your availability, I&#39;ll work around your schedule so that we can find time to meet.
It&#39;s been a, a bit of a chaotic couple of weeks because of clients, taxes, and a couple of people being out.
But we&#39;re, we&#39;re starting to settle down a little bit. So first thing that I wanted to show you is this document that I will share with you too.
This is quarterly OKRs and priorities that put together for this quarter. And I have something here for for you to get onboarded.
And I want to introduce you to 3FR or critical clients or high value and from a, from the five. And then we&#39;re doing quarterly updates with, with quarterly check-ins with each of them.
What I want to do is start off with an introduction and then. You can set up a series of recurring meetings with them every quarter to set up any high priority items or goals.
And then it&#39;s sort of a check-in to make sure that we&#39;re not dropping the ball on something. I was also hoping that we can plan out one webinar this quarter for the clients.
We&#39;ve been doing those monthly but since Ken&#39;s no longer here, we&#39;ll be doing those we haven&#39;t, we haven&#39;t done that for this month and last month.
So we&#39;ll do one this quarter since the July 1st academic year. This is almost here. This first webinar that we do together, you and I can split that and it&#39;ll be to prep metrics for the next academic year.
Now we do, we send out an annual survey to our clients to get feedback. I&#39;m going to give find that old survey and ask Mike to share that with you.
I feel like we could update some of those questions before we send them out. We want to collect feedback on the the experience talking to our customer support.
So our goal is to get some NPS, CSAT and there&#39;s one other score that we try to get through that.
So we can talk about that later this month. It&#39;s not urgent. And then ideally once a month. I&#39;d like us to have a call where we all meet for about 30 minutes to an hour to go over each of our clients and put and do a quick check on how they are doing because different team members are working with
different clients and we want to maintain a dashboard. Spreadsheet that shows how they&#39;re doing with any any major things that the team should be aware of and sometimes when we&#39;re working quickly we don&#39;t always have visibility into the health of that dash the health of that client and if we do that
as a monthly check we want to make sure that anything that would risk that contract is being addressed proactively. Feel free to look through these other items too.
It&#39;s different team members are working on different things and we&#39;re meeting every Thursday to review progress and create and picking out tasks for the next week.
Let&#39;s see another document that I wanted to share with you is it&#39;s KP. This document is something that I shared with the client.
I CC&#39;d you on that email. These are some of the issues that we have identified as needs improvement. Some of them are bugs.
Some of them are dated related cleanup that we have to do for that client. And some of them are features.
And over the next few weeks as we meet with their different departments and try to rebuild that relationship, we&#39;re going to be using this document to track the priority items and then have their institutional director.
Help us decide what is more important. So this is for Kaiser Permanente, that client that we&#39;re having some challenges with their first set of meetings with their departments is next week.
And that&#39;s on my calendar here this April 18th, 2 to 3 p.m. And then Thursday. 20th, 12 p.m. To 1 p.m.
Eastern time. So if you are available for these three meetings or any any of them we&#39;d love to have you on that call.
We&#39;re going to be, these are three internal medicine programs. That are not using metrics to fully manage their programs or one of them I think is not using much at all.
And the first meeting is to identify the challenges they&#39;re having and then decide what&#39;s the best strategy to get them back on board.
Whether it&#39;s training, whether it&#39;s addressing some usability issues. So this is a catch-up call with them to set priorities. So three things we reviewed essentially the the OKRs, this Kaiser document, and then these three meetings.
And the last thing is we do have a meeting with our developers in the morning on Mondays at 9 a.m.
To 10 a.m. Eastern time. And then we also have our daily huddle at 10 a.m. Eastern time. Feel free to hop into any one of these if you are available.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/13b3934ebe5c47cea15ceb9851a5a42a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updated sequence in Reply - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 31 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Marcus and Mark. So we can use this website to find all of the different schools that are osteopathic schools.
And osteopathic schools are schools that train the Do doctors. And in medicine there are two types of doctors. There are those with the MD after their name.
And those with the do after the name for clinical purpose. They&#39;re identical. There are two different categories of schools. This page lists out all the schools and for us to find the clinical leadership.
So we can take the name, go to Google quotes, and then put Clinical Dean and spend a few minutes on their website.
And let&#39;s go to academics or departments. And you can find the clinical science department, for example. There may be, Let&#39;s see, Okay, so here is the clinical education department.
And then if we go to I found these, these websites very useful cuz oftentimes we can target them very give &#39;em a very targeted email.
So for example, let&#39;s go to, I&#39;ve never been on this website, so I&#39;m a little lost here. Clinical center facility looking for the leadership ship.
Okay, here&#39;s a good source. Clinical manuals often have contact information. So go through here. This is actually probably the best source because it&#39;s made for students and then it gives us a lot of insight into what we need.
So actually it, I think the first thing that we can do is search for the handbooks for all 38 schools and put it into a Google drive.
Then we can use that to find the contact information and target each of these schools. So here we go. He got this person that&#39;s providing technical support for one of their apps that we would be able to take over.
They have some EPA app, and let&#39;s Google this person. So again, now we&#39;re in a better, we got more contacts here.
Faculty development. Okay, now we&#39;re getting into, they use e medley. It&#39;s one of our competitors. So I think the best thing is, best thing for us to do is create, I mean search for each of these schools.
And let&#39;s, as a first step got too many tabs open, take this and search for and like clinical handbook or let&#39;s say handbook, education handbook and piece preceptor Guide.
So with this we can get all the contact information. Also see what com oftentimes what our, what the competition is.
So you can see Elantra is the software they&#39;re using is one of our competitors. And once we have this information, we want to the best would be for us to target any schools that are using evalue.
They are going to be the weakest one for us to pull a client away from. Yeah, so let&#39;s close this.
Close this and we can start with these osteopathic schools. So Mark, if you could start a Google Drive folder and collect the handbooks for every school that we have here.
And once we have the handbook, we can have a follow up meeting or discussion about how to extract the best contacts from there and see what other useful we can pull from there.
Useful information we can pull from there. Once we do the osteopathic program, we can also do allopathic the MD program later.
And even do international schools like Caribbean schools with the same approach. And this clinical Guide handbook is gonna give us all the information we.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/71571001bc2f4c67b6c7f3a43fbe1f7c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>GPT</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon everyone. I wanted to create this video to share some ways that I&#39;ve been Using GPT for day to day work and how it&#39;s been helpful.
And I&#39;m going to put some of these prompts that I&#39;m coming up with in a document. And this is to this video is to start the conversation and metrics in the Slack channel about creative ways that we can use this tool to make our work easier and be able to handle the some of the redundant work or some
of the creative work that needs to be done. So, these are a few examples from the last couple of weeks that I wanted to share.
I&#39;m sure other members of the team have been using it in different ways, so feel free to share anything that you have done.
So, I want to encourage people to use this as much as possible in a cautious way, so that it is not something that is putting anything at risk.
And also not decreasing the quality of what we&#39;re doing, but I think with us looking at this tool as a way to increase our speed at doing certain tasks.
And also to come up with new ideas on certain projects that&#39;s, that we can take that information and do something with.
Then it&#39;s, it&#39;s a very useful tool. And it is. It is not something that we should ignore because the way that we do work is evolving and we want to make sure that we&#39;re keeping up with this.
So first here I was recently working on a. Task where I wanted to improve the. The copy that we have on one of our models.
So on this model. We have some text here that we had written that the customers were not finding. We&#39;re having difficulty understanding.
And also the error messages that we were providing needed to be improved. So in the past, you know, I would write all this and try to think of all the different scenarios and try to address that to.
Make it easier. Let me try what GPT for would do. So I said percent to be a UX writer. So in this problem, telling the AI how to.
Respond like, or what is a context in which and how they should write this. And then rewrite this micro copy for medical students scheduling software.
Where schedules are imported from a CSV. And I copy and paste to the text. We had there and it helped rewrite this.
So this, this is definitely helpful. But I was like, let me take this a little step further. And I looked at the CSV import template that we&#39;re using.
And as you know, our errors. It needs to be improved. So I said, let me pretend like this is a human that I&#39;m talking to and show the AI tool a sample of the CSV.
So all I did was. Downloaded. Where do we go? Let&#39;s go to demo. And go to schedules. Download CSV. So I downloaded it, copied and pasted the text in that.
Sample CSV and pasted it in here. So you can see rotation code, rotation site code, site name. That&#39;s the first row.
This is the second row. This is the third row. Below is a CSV of three rows, first row is a header, second row is instructions, third row is sample data.
And then I&#39;m asking it to give me the validation messages. So you can see it gave me all the, possible ways a customer can potentially enter bad data and the appropriate inline validation message to provide.
So with that I was able to easily update, this copy and I also made some changes and added some things but this saved me a ton of time and it&#39;s something that has a different team member is when they come across these kind of problems you can apply this same strategy to get the copy we need to improve
the user experience so another example here let&#39;s go to this one is so in this example I copied and paste it from a PDF, the physician competency reference set from AAMC.
And then I told the thing I would like to know specific institutional map for. Okay, so what I did was I asked the AI to map a set of objectives.
From a, for basically doing what the clients typically do. Actually, here&#39;s a better example. So, I copied and pasted the national AAMC&#39;s objectives here.
And then I asked the tool to map a medical school&#39;s objectives to a national set of objectives. And a lot of our clients take a bunch of time to manually do this.
And now, I was able to do this and give me something that I can work with and review and approve.
The reason I tried doing this was because when we are testing or doing some, or providing a demo to a client, we have to create this fake data.
And instead of having to write all this manually, I can quickly generate data for testing. I have a better example here.
I think this was it. So yesterday I was working on creating a demo environment for an a new prospect and you can see here what I this is a CSV import template that contains the description and fields of to import data is used by medical and nursing school to object import nursing school objectives
into a education management platform so this here is simply our program objective upload CSV so what I did was ask GPC to use this CSV file and prepare a fake upload file with fake objectives for the first in school.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f7cc099394b540439fec6032691e351f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys, so this is going to be a task to address some issues that we have with the milestones upload on the company portal.
About the programs. And edit is a brand new program I created and I have this import file that I made and I get this very useful error message, which is error occurred and doesn&#39;t tell me anything about it.
And I&#39;ve tried a few different versions of these. Maria have tried to upload it herself and there&#39;s something that is not formatted correctly.
So it would be very helpful for us to at least know what row the error is so that we can.
. Troubleshoot it. This is a page that is only used by metrics employees, so we don&#39;t have to be super detailed.
At the very least, what row the error is so that we can fix it. And along the same along the same.
Lines, if we go into programs and if I open up. Let&#39;s say this milestones page. We don&#39;t have any milestones here.
Let me go to. Demo. Institution. No portals company. Milestones. It takes a while to load if there&#39;s anything that we can do to improve that.
That&#39;ll be. Great. We can rename this to competencies and that&#39;s what we call it everywhere else. So competencies. And then when you click on this, we have the ability to edit this which is great.
It would be. Awesome if we also have the ability to add and delete here. So we can turn this into an edit and delete icon.
So it doesn&#39;t take up too much screen space. Just like this edit and delete icon. Editing will happen in line and deletion would ask for a confirmation.
And what we want to do is when we&#39;re on this page. Also add a on the miles medical knowledge hierarchy.
A. Actually, we should put this into a sub. Instead of showing it under the code column, it would be separate column that shows the edit and delete icon.
And then. On the parent, we would show an add. Button. And when we click, it could be a little plus button.
And when we click that plus button, it would add a new role like that. With the, with three editable fields.
One is the code, the text, and the effective date. Same thing when we&#39;re editing. I want to be able to edit the code, the the text, and the effective date.
This would be a date selector. And if, if I choose a code that is not unique, then it would as it will show a sweet alert that says, please enter it.
A code that is unique. So if I&#39;m on patient care, the add button would show on patient care. If I expand this, then it would disappear from patient care and show it.
In the page PC one. Row. So I will be able to edit anything that&#39;s in here and also add more.
Milestones. Milestones. To these. To these levels. I would not be able to add more levels or just be able to add more milestones.
Milestones. Actually. If we can add more levels, that would be fine too. So that would be when I&#39;m clicking on add, it would let me add more levels and then expand that and then it would let me add more milestones underneath that.
So essentially. We&#39;re making it so that if somebody wants to create this hierarchy here manually, they could do that. Same thing on the parent here, I click add and that would allow me to add a category.
This would also apply under system setup competencies on the admin portal. The same change that we made to the previous page would also apply here.
We renamed this to. And then edit here so I can click add create a new category with the effective date and the code then expand it.
Create add more. Sub competencies with edit and delete functionality for each of them. And then expanded more be able to add more levels with the ability to edit.
And then within each. Level of the able to add milestones.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/60417b5d6be542e7a1e04a8c9b70d70e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (342) - 27 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Alejandro, so I wanted to create this video to show you how you can do a review of support issues and share an update once a day.

If the last message is from the client and it&#39;s been more than one day more than 24 hours, we want to take this URL and put this into Slack.
Let&#39;s say client support. Like that. And you can take the, person. So this is Maria. If you hold down, actually, if you, if you want to build a list like this in your.
Is a thing called. If you choose your name here, it&#39;s a good way to set this everything up. So you can say Maria.
Yeah. You hold on the shift button and click. Enter and it won&#39;t send the message. You can keep typing and I can add a.
Link there and then. Over here, so this was. We&#39;re working on a task is from two months ago. So. So here&#39;s one from three months ago.
I signed the CRIS. So what I&#39;m doing is looking at the last message and seeing if this is an old issue that the client reported.
So this was four months ago. We sent them a message. And we still haven&#39;t closed this issue. So I&#39;m going to take this.
This is from Maria. And only, and like right now I&#39;m showing it as an example with all of these issues, but we want to focus only on the ones that are older.
So this one is 21 days ago. This is for me. I think if you sort it by oldest, you&#39;ll have the oldest at the top and then going down the list to see.
Which messages need attention because we have not followed up with the customer in 24 hours or more.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6eac2a71d14445d2b59f400a9f87c07a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (283) - 24 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Alejandro. So I wanted to give you an overview of how the support channels work. So under customer support, this is where any new emails come in.
From the customers and then in our software, we have a chat icon. So if I go and open this up and click new message.
C rest. And you can see that coming here as a question. And if I respond to this. It will show up here as a response.
So. That is how we are managing all the questions from the customers. Something that we could use help with is making sure that we are all keeping up with our messages.
So if you&#39;re. In here. Maybe once a day or a couple of times a day, looking through anything that is in.
Unassigned or assigned. Actually, what you could do is you can click click create view and. Call this support issues. And then choose customer support and then choose me, Chris, Maria, Mike.
Actually, you can choose. Choose all of them. And then create a view and that&#39;ll show you all of the open support issues.
And then looking at it to see if there&#39;s anything that we have to. Follow up on that is that we have fallen behind on.
So for example this one We received a message from Eric, but Chris has not responded to it yet and it&#39;s been 11 days So it will be taking this link and sending it to Chris in Slack and saying can you I think if it&#39;s it hasn&#39;t been responded for at least 24 hours like a day we should send that message
to the person saying hey please follow up so this is we don&#39;t we haven&#39;t been keeping up for some of these things because we&#39;re doing multiple tasks and I think if you can click through it once a day see if there&#39;s anything that is more than 24 hours and send a link to that person to follow
up and you can look at it to see who it&#39;s assigned to so for example this is one of mine that I need to follow up with and this way if if we don&#39;t fall behind on our support issues and the other project that I was mentioning last night this is a a cleanup project in in growthops we have several
feature requests that we have added so for example this one is an idea that we have that we have to move over to a different project so growthop has all the business projects and then the dev pro- this dev board has all the software development projects so some of this needs to be moved over so for example
this one if I want to move that over I would click dot dot dot move and then it would go into dev and then feature and then next and story points next and then confirm and that&#39;ll move it over to the other project so what I will do is as I see these tasks in here I will assign them to you and then you
can help move that over to the other board so let me pick out a few of these here you can msp e that one msp e that one.
Alright, so there may be other ones, but we can start with those and then as I find them else, I&#39;ll add them to you, then you can move that over.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9838d87662164945a1249df124ca122d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sent Mail - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 28 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, Alexandra. Thank you for posting these issues. This is perfect so that at the start of each day. We post the list and I wanted to give you a couple of pointers to help make this easier so that It&#39;s you can prepare the list.
The best way to do that is to take like you&#39;re on windows so you can make a note. Which has the different URLs.
Such as this list here. So let&#39;s see. So in Microsoft Word or Notes you can make the list first. List of issues.
I was putting that as a placeholder, so you don&#39;t need to paste that in there. And. And then in whichever.
Microsoft Word, or Google Docs, or Notepad.. So, once we have it ready, then we can take, copy and paste it into Microsoft Word.
To Slack. Like that. Paste it. And then send it. This way the formatting and everything can be done outside of Slack.
And then you&#39;re pasting it and it looks like a cleaner</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/443d50a114ee40e19bb0729c000078dc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Evaluations Step 1: Basic Setup - Microcopy Improvements – Figma - 28 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so for this first part, here&#39;s an idea that I had on how we can simplify this whole thing.
So the form type and the confidential setting is something that and the alerts are something that everybody needs to look at.
But for these other items, I&#39;m thinking it may be good for us to have a section called additional options. And then have a checkbox for include a custom header.
And when that is checked off, it&#39;ll show all of these options. Another checkbox for require signature. And this basically all this text.
Another checkbox for review prior performance. And then a tool tip that shows all this. And then same thing for these.
Essentially consolidating this into additional options with simple one line checkboxes that you turn on to see any additional options. And then showing that.
Text in a tooltip next to that one line phrase. So that way it looks cleaner and not so overwhelming. We can probably do the same thing for the submission alerts and say little radio button.
A checkbox that says send alerts upon submission. Send alerts when evaluation is submitted and when you turn that on, it&#39;ll show these options and then be able to pick someone.
A checkbox that says send alerts when evaluation is submitted and then be able to This is not something that we have to do immediately.
We can work on cleaning up the copy first. I wanted to send you this idea so that you have it in a dev task in for a future enhancement.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7d481073206748c69fb65316dec019e0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 23 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Shaphong. So we had a chance to test some of this functionality and wanted to record this video to show some tweaks that we need to make.
So starting with the, the overall alignment here when, We want to make sure that the text is aligned. So we have this alignment here with all the text.
So this one is shifted over a little. So we can align with this C here at the A there. And to make sure that&#39;s, that&#39;s good there.
And then. So this, this is a, you know, anytime we&#39;re building a feature, we always have to add the ability to delete it too.
So right now there&#39;s no way to. Delete this category. So let&#39;s make sure we add that delete option here. For adding a custom field.
When every time we have a, a check box, we want to make sure that it&#39;s clickable from the text as well as the check box.
So if a user clicks here, it should become active. And then these are appear clickable, but they&#39;re not. So we have to make sure that this shows some sort of a pop over.
It looks like it is. You hover over it, something shows up. So. Let&#39;s show a tool tip or something that shows the options or a pop over.
And that&#39;ll make it easier for the user for to see that, see that information. And another thing that I noticed is we call this short text, free text, but over here we call a long text.
So let&#39;s make sure that drop down here shows it as long text. On this here, it&#39;s a little confusing. So if I&#39;m by default when I&#39;m adding a custom field.
Each time I add a field, we can apply an increment. We get like an integer. So that it increases by one.
So the first field is one second. And fields two, and they can adjust it if needed. And also instead of move field number, Let&#39;s call this field position.
And then. This button instead of call to move, we&#39;ll call it update all. And that button can. Become active if we make any changes.
So right now the gray is inactive. But if I change the number here, it can become and then same thing here instead of move, let&#39;s call it update and also become, hey, it can be.
Gray by default, and if I put a number in, then it can become. Green so that they can click on it and update that one value.
So we&#39;re trying to make it more intuitive there. One more thing that we noticed here is we deactivate. Doesn&#39;t update the page after the first one.
So we want to make sure that if we deactivate is disappearing and going to the inactive tab. It does work if you activate it.
Then if I I&#39;m editing something, if I go to this field and let&#39;s make this delete button the same. Same size as this delete instead of this big one because you can accidentally delete it.
And when I do make a deletion. We want to show a sweet alert and say, are you sure you want to remove the option?
And then it can remove it. And the other thing that we notice is if I come in here and type something and click.
Enter. It&#39;s deleting an option and closing the modal. Instead, if I click enter, it should add that to the list.
See there, here it is again. If I click enter, it&#39;s doing that. It deletes it, or it looks like it&#39;s deleting it.
But it&#39;s not actually deleting it. Well, it&#39;s back. There&#39;s something weird going on here. So if I don&#39;t refresh the page, if I delete this I&#39;ll, It says one option, but if I edit it, it&#39;s back here.
So that&#39;s some of the tweaks on this page. Then we go to this site page here. I feel like we may be using a different.
Some different CSS here.. Because I&#39;m noticing some extra spaces between the field and the label and we&#39;re not using a View Tree Select.
So we should be. Using a. Yeah, so we should be using. You tree select on these models. Everywhere that we have a multi select.
Instead of these multi select fields. And so also add some spacing between these fields so they&#39;re not. Smashed against each other.
And while we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s also call this a site code instead of a site ID. And update the error message also to be site code.
And then one I think I forgot to mention. Is custom fields. When I click delete, like I should not be able to delete a field if I already have data added to it.
So if I added a user field and I store some data in the. Database for that field, this delete button should not appear.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/610c42aacbdc46e0b9f995da5e1c2af9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Projects - Google Docs - 25 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, mark. So here&#39;s a outline of our current onboarding projects. We have four different projects that we do. Curriculum clerkship, pre clerkship, M S P E, and then for each of them, there&#39;s a different set of objectives and key results that I&#39;ve outlined for separate projects.
But we need to now start to consolidate them and standardize them. And then there&#39;s a set of recurring meeting agendas for each of them with list of action items and a set of different set of CSVs that are needed for each of these projects.
So a client can potentially purchase the full platform, and they may have four or five different projects that we run with them, each of them spanning about 10 weeks.
And then before the kickoff, the project leads would set up a, a onboarding worksheet in the client onboarding folder in Google Drive.
And then I would write out the pro project objectives, starting with a template and customizing it for a specific client&#39;s on sales discussion.
And then the project lead would adjust the a agendas for the recurring meetings. During the kickoff, we review the objectives and key results with the leadership and get agreement, and then we adjust the The occurring, the recurring meetings as needed.
And then we review each of it during the, each of the meetings that are scheduled, and then creates separate action items.
So the one, the things that we have here at the bottom is a little messy, and this is meant I basically copied and pasted the objectives and key results for different projects, and I tagged it as where that project came from.
But I&#39;ve also linked the project template here. So this is the template that we&#39;re currently using to kick off any project.
And then customizing the, the content to match that project&#39;s requirement. So you can see that template. And then you can also see samples of each, each of the projects that we worked on, where this is the MSU clerkship one, and then you can see the meeting agendas who attended, and then the files and action items on the right side.
You have MSU clerkship, Purdue Clerkship, MSU Plea, pre clerkship LMU clerkship. Then there&#39;s also St. James,  Onboarding worksheet right here.
And it has it own set of objectives. So some of these clients are using the same things for clerkship. Some did not set up the, the integrations or great book, so maybe slightly different, but I have linked all of them here, so you can take a look.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/880f6eddc50b4b9998e8f5583df5bc6a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Mark. So over the weekend I was working on some documentation for a U c and it is for the M S P E project.
While working on this, I realized something that we can leverage to create some better documentation for integration in metrics. We have added this API internal tool that pretty much lists out all of the endpoints.
Auto, auto generates an endpoint for every model. And if we open this up, let&#39;s see, great book here. And I go to there&#39;s an option that we added called Allows us to update data using CSVs and allows us to download date, bulk download data, and bulk upload data.
If I go to the CSV, upload this auto generates this table. And what I did was I open up the relevant end points and I copied and pasted it into here so that I can create this documentation.
What I was thinking that Lay can help us do. We don&#39;t need documentation for everything, but if we pick out the modules that require documentation from the client side, such as let&#39;s say procedures or of evaluations, then, or even from a maybe you have a better idea of what are the types of
things that we need to document and then having lay go in here, copy and paste this table into, we can create separate documents for each of our modules with the tables.
And then Chris and I could go in here and update the label column with the description like I did here.
And then we have the necessary documentation to share with clients or even for our developers to understand it. Cuz that has been the challenge for a tum.
They were never given a document like this and, and this is something that is necessary for them to understand it.
And I&#39;m also including some steps that tells them how to create and update the records and what information to submit.
And without this information, they&#39;re kind of flying blind. Chris Chris did review some of this in a call with them and they have about 80% of it written down in their own notes.
But I think what happens is they write it down and then someone else looks at those notes. It&#39;s not getting in across the organization as different teams are working on it.
If we have our own document, like this is one trans central truth source of truth for this information.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f17a9168d5934eb8a3d1d7c28ef0ed65</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 5 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, &lt;unk&gt;. So I&#39;m testing this new functionality and we go into custom fields. This is working out. Some of it is working out great, and I&#39;m editing the fields and I can add the description.
One of the things that I noticed is that when I&#39;m adding a category like it&#39;s prefilled with the name category, it shouldn&#39;t, it shouldn&#39;t be like that.
It should be blank is that category and save the description and it works fine. And then if I go to site field let&#39;s add category here.
So it&#39;s pre-filling from the field that I was look, just looking at, it shouldn&#39;t happen. It shouldn&#39;t ha same thing.
Shouldn&#39;t happen again. So if I added a category already when I come back to this adding a second category, it, it shouldn&#39;t retain what was already added before.
So It&#39;s One bug. Okay, now I added a category here. I realize that there&#39;s no way for us to see the description.
So let&#39;s show the description under here in a simple text so that whoever adds a category and description can see that.
And then I add a custom site field. There&#39;s no way for me to select whether I want a Tex field.
So if I go to user fields, add custom user field here, I can select what type of field I want.
However, when I add site fields, there&#39;s no way for me to set that. And then let&#39;s create a field under this Site Field, internal save.
Please fill out all the fields. It doesn&#39;t tell me what&#39;s a required field and what&#39;s not. So if it is something that we&#39;re requiring, it should have a let red asterisk or say required underneath it in or next to it in italics, like we do in other parts of the system.
And the so, so right now it should, it will only save if I add the description, but it req, we don&#39;t need the description to be required because we don&#39;t require it on the user fields.
So it, it&#39;ll be poor usability to have it required on one field, but not on the other one. So let&#39;s make this not required.
And for anything that&#39;s required, let&#39;s indicate with a red asterisk that is required. All right. And then Let&#39;s Do this.
Okay, we got that. And then for this field we don&#39;t need to show mo field, mo field multiple times. We can simply show it once at the top.
And then this field can be a little bit bigger. So you can read the numbers in, in there. It&#39;s saying it&#39;s up.
Move field, updated when nothing happens here, if it&#39;s changed at two and I update it, it should move to the second location.
The second in order. All right, now I&#39;m going to click at it. How do I delete? I don&#39;t see any options for deleting a record.
So that&#39;s a big problem. So we need to add a way to delete a record if it hasn&#39;t been used to store any data.
So ability to delete if the field does not have any data stored. And little things like this, we wanna make sure there&#39;s no space here.
And then capitalize the I and the E. And now we&#39;re on this page. When we&#39;re creating a new site, when it&#39;s being created, we wanna show those fields at the bottom.
So if I&#39;m setting it as internal, then I would show the, see the internal fields. If I&#39;m setting it as external, then I would see the external fields.
And then if we&#39;re gonna be using this new Option here, We don&#39;t need to have the external internal here, and we should get rid of this original button.
So I click internal site and show all the internal fields without this designation. Create external site and it&#39;ll show you all the details there.
And then at the top, we can also update this to say new internal site or new external site. And all of the sections should be opened by default so that the user does not have to click on it to open it.
So if I have custom categories that show up at the bottom, it should be expanded like this. All right, let me open one of these and then click edit profile, come down to the bottom.
You can see here that this is all collapsed. Instead of having it collapsed, we want it expanded so that the users can see the field without having to click into it.
And the other thing I&#39;m noticing here is if I click here, nothing happens. I have to click on the actual text for it to open.
Instead, we should make it so that you can click anywhere and it&#39;ll expand it. Then there&#39;s another problem here where we have the first and ne last name test.
This is supposed to be the description field. Typically in the system, we have the, the name of the field in bold, and we don&#39;t need the co, the colon.
And then the description would show up under it in a plain text. So let me see if I can show you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a999da7bb2cb4345ad5542d4185040f1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Designs | Banner for medical education conference for brand building | Signage contest - 24 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, how are you?

So one of the things that we were hoping to do is at the top we wanna put it each new physician you train will impact.
So that&#39;ll be at the top. Put these numbers and we also wanna make these texts a little bit more prominent patients a day, days a year.
And this text here is too long, so we&#39;re gonna change, take that out and put your, your work matters, your time matters.
And at the bottom here, we don&#39;t like this white thing that&#39;s around the logo. So we wanted to maybe make a little bit more space at the bottom so that the logo can be on the left side by itself on white background.
And then on the right side we&#39;ll have residency management software with our website, metrics lab.com. And then visit us both number.
So overall we do like this wave appearance that 3D lines that is in the background that we can take out and instead keep it simpler.
And then for the logo, put it on a white background at the bo on the bottom with the residency management software and metrics lab.com on the right.
And then maybe having visit like that in the middle. And for font we wanna use Myriad Pro, And if myriad Pro is not available, you can use Lado.

I was reviewing this form with our team here and we&#39;ve been thinking about how to structure this in the system, and there are a couple of options.
So the, this form is showing a set of competencies like that are broken up into seven questions. And then each of those are being a******* for a different patient population.
And what we could do is turn them into either multiple choice questions like this, or competency style questions like this where you have the competency and the description on the right side.
And then those seven questions can appear in a category like infant, it&#39;ll have seven questions, and then children will have seven questions.
So as a user is scrolling down, they&#39;re focusing on one patient population, answering all the questions about it, then moving on to the next patient population, answering all the questions about it, and so on.
So this setup would allow you to collect that information in in one form. Another thing to consider is whether you wanna break this up into separate forms for each of the different patient population.
I&#39;m not sure if this is something that is gonna be completed multiple times during a rotation. If so, then maybe it can be completed at different times, like the infant and the children can go together.
And then that can be done at, after a per certain time and the adults can be grouped together. That&#39;s the, the other recommendation or suggestion.
And there, there is a, a slight improvement that we can do if, if the Questions in the question bank can be created as competencies and then imported into a form.
So the recommendation I was making earlier, or was to add each of those questions directly to the form. A second approach will be to create those questions in the question bank and then add them to the template.
There is a limitation in the system right now where you could only add one, the, the question once to the form.
So if you&#39;re gonna try to put all patient questions into one form, currently won&#39;t let you do that. We can talk to the technical team and see if there&#39;s a way to allow for more than one question to exist on the same form.
If that&#39;s the case, then maybe we can use the same approach. So this, this would be seven questions in the question bank getting added to a form multiple times.
But the data is getting back, added back to the same question. They if you&#39;re making separate forms for each of the patient population, then it is it&#39;s possible for you to have all the questions, seven questions in here, and then import those to different forms and then have that set up
without any, any additional development work. So I hope this helps with some of the planning. And if we need to, we can hop on a quick call next week and talk through it some more.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9235fac5e8d44c42a38263bfa7c1083c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Upstate Optimizer</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Teresa and Amber. This is a template that we are setting up to collect the optimizer rules and it needs to be structured in a certain format, but it also is dependent on the, the structure of the courses.
So I wanna review the weights laid out now, then you can let me know if we have it correctly. So we have the longitudinal course, L C P, and within that particular course type, we have these courses being created that represents a combination of a site and a preceptor.
So a site one, preceptor one. So if a hospital or clinic has more than one faculty member that or attending, that is gonna be serving as a preceptor For this program.
You would have it as L c P site one preceptor, one l c site one, preceptor two. So once you have the site names and the preceptor names, that can be updated to that correct name.
And then we have the site names here, preceptor names. For now we&#39;re keeping it simple as one column, but in the future when we are setting this up in metrics, it&#39;ll have their first, last name and email and so on.
And then for the constraints, this is where we wanted to clarify with you, if you have a preceptor accepting a student, are the students going to be with the same preceptor for all weeks of that semester?
So let&#39;s say we have weeks one through 13, made that number up 13 weeks in the semester, and the first preceptor is available on Mondays.
If a student is assigned to that preceptor, will they be going every Monday for all 13 weeks or will they be going to different preceptors each week or there&#39;s some sort of mixing going on?
And that&#39;s the first question. The second question is, are preceptors all going to be providing consistent avail availability like this where they are saying, I&#39;m always going to be available on a Monday or Wednesday for the entire 13 weeks of the semester, or will they be providing different availability for each week?
And if they&#39;re providing different availability, then we&#39;ll need, we may need to look into this differently, but I wanted to send this to you to start with and you can provide us with feedback and then we can use that to tweak it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/67086f98c7894f1b9184c59ddcc5b217</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Projects - Google Docs - 25 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, mark.

And then we talk to the client and make sure that they&#39;re aligned on that same same set of objectives. And for each of those key results, we incorporate that into the agenda for the recurring meetings.
And then each recurring meeting has agenda with a list of action items that that client has to complete. And then we also have this document list out all the contacts for our side and the contacts for their side.

And then metric leads, Purdue vet leads. And these are some of the information that we collected from them at the bottom.
So you can see sorry, I&#39;ll go back here. So these objectives at the top belong to lmu. So this is for Lmu.
This here is for msu curriculum implementation. And I&#39;m gonna re rename this to LMU Clerkship. These are the types of projects that we have defined.
So that&#39;s for clerkship. This is for curriculum. And let&#39;s ignore this one here. This here is for MSU clerkship. So my recommendation is I think we can start with the MSU clerkship and use that as a starting point for the clerkship onboarding and create a separate document from that.
And then we can fill in some of the other missing items that we have defined in the other projects. And once we have that consolidated into new one, that could be the clerkship implementation objectives.
And then each time we have a clerkship implementation project happening, we would start a new worksheet, copy and paste the objectives and key results to the top.
And then these agenda items can also become standardized and then someone can run through the scope and the meeting agendas with the deans as part of the kickoff and finalize it for us to start those recurring meetings.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9594d34be7554cc6be9c2d18a470188a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Ideas - Google Docs - 19 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>All right, we&#39;ll zoom out just a little bit. So and, and again, Ken, you know, apologies if Tasha&#39;s already kind of given you a little bit of a rundown of who we are, but, you know, again, we are consultants by nature, but we, we also have a team full of industry experts, you know, coordinators you know, institutional leadership, things like that.
They&#39;re all kind of banded together to, to kind of provide a lot of these, why can I not get everybody&#39;s faces back up?
Sorry, &lt;laugh&gt;. It&#39;s been, it&#39;s been a long day. All so anyway, so when we, we primarily focus on graduate medical education, we do dip our toe a little bit into the e side just naturally cuz of the medical schools primarily working with a lot of hospital executives.
But when we get down to like the actual program operations you know, again, we are doing a lot of one-on-one work with coordinators.
We&#39;re, we stand up a lot of new programs as well. So we&#39;re doing a lot of like development and training with, I mean, you know, you, you think that program directors would, would maybe be a little bit farther along what they&#39;re sometimes, but obviously they need a lot of support as well.
Yes. As well as some of their core faculty. You know, again, there&#39;s a lot of educators out there that, that are, you know, fairly new to this role.
So you know, we, we provide a lot of guidance, a lot of education, a lot of resources. But we do, I would say from the operations standpoint, when you start talking about like our, you know, supporting tools and technologies that help run the program, RMS platforms you know, finance, technology, you know, different scheduling tools, things like that we are you know, actively supporting the, the coordinators not only getting up to speed, but sometimes in an interim capacity.
And I think Tashi kind of pointed that out that the turnover is fairly high in this role. Mm-hmm. &lt;affirmative&gt;. Yeah.
And we&#39;re working on ways to help coordinators through some webinar series and stuff like that coming up, like on how to help them you know, per professionally develop, but also network within the industry and kinda take that next step if there is one.
So that&#39;s, that&#39;s kind of like I said, I mean it&#39;s, you know, obviously there, there&#39;s a cyclical nature to like, to what they&#39;re doing.
You know, it&#39;s the academic year, what they&#39;re doing now will eventually come back around, whether it&#39;s recruiting or onboarding or yeah.
You know so, so there is some advantages and, and, and, you know, being able to provide some type of educational resources and guidance.
Now, hopefully they&#39;ll, they&#39;ll stick around and, and they&#39;ll see that again and it&#39;ll all kind of stick. But a lot of institutions, I have to admit, like we end up, when we work with them in that capacity, we, we end up sticking around for a couple years just cause, you know, whether we&#39;re, you know, a lot of times when we work with a large institution, when we come in and work with one or two programs, it ends up spreading to, to, you know, all of the programs Yeah.
In some capacity. So, so naturally there&#39;s, there&#39;s different groups and committees and cohorts and things like that that get established.
So yeah, I mean, I can go through kind of this in in more detail, but is that a quick good rundown, Susan?
Or would you say that there&#39;s anything else that you would, you would add just based on our kind, like ops support element?
No, I think, I think that&#39;s fair. You know, we do all of these service lines that are here and, you know, we often enter the client in different places and then it turns into ops, which would be kinda mainly where we&#39;re gonna encounter RMSs there and also in accreditation when we&#39;re starting new programs.
But I think, I think you covered the ops part line. Yeah. And, and then when you, when you do engage with them is it typically like an open-ended relationship?
Or is it project by project? It&#39;s a spectrum. Okay. Honestly it, it depends on what their needs are at that time.
Oftentimes it is a, a, a, you know, a smaller project, you know, just to, and then obviously we were able to show, kind of showcase some of our, our expertise and knowledge and, and we oftentimes find other areas where, you know, support or, or you know, some type of specialized knowledge is needed.
Yeah. But we do have a lot of clients when we start getting into the ops piece a lot of those clients are signing up for, you know, a full year&#39;s worth of, of support, you know, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll, a lot of the arrangements either, I mean, some of them are like time materials or retainer arrangements.
Yeah. And then some of them are like a fixed fee or, or we&#39;ll budget, you know, to meet with them, you know, for, you know, eight hours a week or something like that.
Just depends on the size of the institution and, and what their needs are. Okay. So, so From a, from, go ahead.
From the technology standpoint having been in, in the business this long and having worked with a lot of these organizations, what do you, do you see any, any areas that, you know that we can work together on?
From a as a, like for example, like if you are consulting with the companies, I mean these organizations are you able to recommend one platform or, or, and have a partnership with the, like a business partnership with the company?
Or does that, like, how does, what is, what do you think will be a good approach for us? Because I think you have more experience with these larger organizations.
So I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are. So I would say that usually what happens is when we&#39;re starting new programs, that&#39;s when we have the most opportunity to make any recommendation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a0eeda6861f44ad1a04f6965e40448a1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of March 5, 2023 - 3 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jake. So we&#39;ve been looking at this form and seeing what we can do with it. So from the way that I&#39;m reading it, we have these competencies and then we have competencies being a******* for each patient population.
So what we could do is turn this into questions in metrics as either multiple choice questions like this Or as competency style questions in here.
And then have categories. So infant, it&#39;ll have seven questions. Children will have seven questions, and then you could collect the data and then average the results will be averaged together.
So that&#39;s one approach. And the other approach is, I&#39;m not sure how often these forms are collected. You could turn &#39;em into separate forms for different patient populations and have shorter forms that are being completed.
And then that will be a way to break it up into something that is shorter. It either way. It, it, you know, even if it&#39;s a a one form, it&#39;ll have, it&#39;ll have more questions and it&#39;ll seem longer because it&#39;s longer because there&#39;s more space being taken out.
But from a, from a a user that&#39;s completing it, the number of decisions that they have to make and the number of clicks that they have to do is still the same, whether it&#39;s a grid like this or a, a form that is in in metrics that has separate questions.
And when we had done the research on this and, and, and there&#39;s a couple of papers on it, it, even if there are separate questions, the users are gonna have a better experience if they are broken up.
So those are the two options that we have to turn this into a form in metrics. And I&#39;m thinking that maybe this is already covered and I&#39;m in for other forms.
And one thing that we are also exploring, and this will require a little bit of a development on our end Our competency style questions,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/43e4be5946ba4e64a3c2e6867bf8deb5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Re: Ideas - Google Docs - 19 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Or was putting something together for our internal people that says, what is it that people like about new innovations and what is it that they don&#39;t like?
Yeah. What is it that they like and don&#39;t like about, you know, about new, about MedHub or about your product?
Because not that we&#39;re gonna share that exactly with the client, but what we can say is the benefits we&#39;re seeing here are this, this, this, or something.
Or, you know, something that allows us to try to help the client with what it is they&#39;re really looking for.
If we see a client and you, you&#39;re providing this level of service that isn&#39;t necessarily provided by new innovations. And we&#39;re gonna say, you know, this product here has a much higher level of service.
Yeah. So why don&#39;t demo from the two companies, three companies, whatever, and let you take a look at the products.
And then they&#39;re likely gonna choose based on service unless there&#39;s some very significant difference somewhere else in, you know, functionality or price or something.
Mm-hmm. &lt;affirmative&gt;. Yeah, no, that is actually exactly what I tell the clients during the demos. It&#39;s like, if you look at all of the companies that are out there, you get take a spreadsheet, they&#39;re all gonna have the same features.
It&#39;s, it&#39;s a, you know, there&#39;s nothing like if you look at a requirements list that we can&#39;t meet that Med Hub has, or we&#39;re all this pretty much the same, but it&#39;s about how user-friendly it is for the end.
Mm-hmm. &lt;affirmative&gt;, not even for the administrators, but the residents, then the faculty members. Cuz if it&#39;s not user-friendly for them, you&#39;re not getting the data that you need.
And, and you know, and when it comes to user-friendliness is also trying to, you have that consumer technology approach so that it is approachable and friendly that, that there are people are used to outside of the hospital tech world.
I mean, that&#39;s really, for me, being a resident and now a faculty peer in a couple evenings a day. That&#39;s, that&#39;s what matters.
I sit down at, at, I&#39;m an emergency radiologist, I sit down in front of my computer with a resident and I get an email to do evaluations.
I click on it. If I&#39;m not going straight to the forum, I&#39;m not coming back to that because until I, until I get to the next email, because it&#39;ll get buried in my inbox.
And, you know, we, we, we include the photos of the people that are, they&#39;re evaluating with all the details with the link directly to that form so that you can complete it without having to log in.
So all these like little things that add up to driving that, that compliance up. And then the other other piece of it is trying to build a company with people that really care about graduate medical education.
Because when it comes to this space, it&#39;s not the most exciting space in the world. And, and not a lot of people are passionate about medical education.
And and so it&#39;s, it&#39;s and I think that&#39;s also where companies have gone wrong in history. You know, med Hub, I know that when they, like I knew their founders when we, when I started in 2013, I met both of them.
Like they were very passionate about what they did did, and that&#39;s why the company became so successful. But after private equity bought them, it was very different.
It was all sales driven and, and so we&#39;ve been trying to build the company in a way that, that you&#39;re not only providing that user friendliness, but also the people to make sure that you&#39;re using the platform to its full potential.
And I think that&#39;s where I saw this opportunity is you seem to be a team that is doing that. And if there is a, a good way for us to work together that is not gonna you know, be difficult for, to, for us to do what we do best, then I think it makes sense.
Cuz then the organizations are benefiting. Yes. Yeah. And then that chat idea is just really something that, and that came to mind as like, you know, if, if an organization is purchasing us, we&#39;re already providing that support.
And maybe there&#39;s a easy addition to say, Hey, you can have Jermaine on board for an added subscription that is, you know, will maybe introduce an annual subscription model for you guys.
And then that&#39;ll also help us with offloading some of that with trusted people that know what they&#39;re doing, so that when they&#39;re talking to someone, they&#39;re getting the same level that we&#39;ve been providing.
Yeah. Like we&#39;ve got, we&#39;ve got customers who are larger organizations and they have trouble kind of keeping keeping their people in line.
There&#39;s some, there&#39;s issues with retention, but then there&#39;s also issues with like, not people retention, but information retention where they sometimes there&#39;s, there&#39;s a struggle to get the staff to consistently enter the information.
And that&#39;s, I mean, we can only help with that so much, it kind of beyond the technical and into the organizational.
So that would be something that maybe our clients would benefit from your expertise. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s unfortunately not, it&#39;s not uncommon to to hear that.
And to your point, I mean, your, your system is only as capable as the information that&#39;s in it and then, and the, and the accuracy of it.
So, yeah. Yeah. And, and you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not something that we have to jump into or you can, you know, think about it and I can, we can have more conversations about it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6bebfef9226a4ec2ae8d4ba4c720d21b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Recorder Settings - 5 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Rohan. I wanted to create this video to show you how the requirements module works and how we can test this new functionality on the 4 19 5 server.
The requirements module can be accessed from the institutional portal or from the admin portal. I&#39;m logged in as per Cox, and when I go to the institutional portal, it allows me to create requirements for all users in the system.
On the admin portal, I can only use, create users, create tasks for our users in that program. So you can think of requirements as tasks that we&#39;re assigning to the user to complete.
So I want to do it from the institutional portal. I can say immunization record, and then specify one of the document categories that I have created.
And then who do I want to assign this to? I can assign this to, let&#39;s say alls PGY 3, 2, 2, 3, and 2, 3, 4, 5.
And then if I select role here too, I mean program, it should limit it to PGY S 2, 3, 4, 5 within this, these programs that I select.
So we have to test that. And then if I select roll, I&#39;m not able to select groups if I uncheck this.
Okay.  Not why I&#39;m not able to select Groups, but, So we gotta think it should be one or the other.
So if I select this, I should be able to select groups and it should only be showing groups from the institutional portal.
Shouldn&#39;t, and then I can as attach a file to this if I want to. When do you want this to be assigned?
I can either assign it today immediately or in the future. I can set a hard deadline saying that this is gonna be due on the 31st.
So one thing I just noticed is that if I select something it&#39;s not getting, this radio button should get turned on.
And by default we should have something selected. And I think that default can be, say 14 days after the assignment date, automatically create new requirements before the document expires.
So the way that this is supposed to work is once you submit a document and it gets an expiration date, it can create, recreate a new assignment before it expires automatically assign requirements to new users automatically.
So let&#39;s say I choose PGY S 2, 3, 4, 5, and then I activate this requirement and I create a new user with the role of PGY three, that individual should get this requirement.
So this, these two looks like it&#39;s a duplicate, so save it&#39;s not letting me save. So I have to choose something here.
So it&#39;ll be nice if we have that required internal medicine. So it&#39;s allowing me to save, even though I haven&#39;t chose who.
So we should have a default for this. Yes. Assignment and immunization record. I just created this. And now if I go to users internal medicine, and let&#39;s find PGY two, John Dorian, and the log out.
This is John Dorian requirements page. Looks like there&#39;s a bug where the footer is getting pulled to the side there.
Okay, nothing&#39;s showing up. So let&#39;s check the assignments page and see what I&#39;ve got assigned. Institutional portal active requirements assigned March 5th.
So these did get assigned you, so this, this should be shown as proper date should say March 5th, 2023, and the date and time.
So once it&#39;s assigned, it shows up in the active requirements. So for us to track if the user completed it, and then once the user completes it, you&#39;ll be able to approve it.
So this filter requirements button should be on the right side. Okay? Go to the assignments page Like this. Looks like a bar, when it should be a button.
All right, so let&#39;s check something else. I go to the user&#39;s page and I&#39;m gonna create a new PGY two user and see if that person gets the assignment.
So let&#39;s call it Sarah James S. James metrics lab.com. I&#39;m gonna choose PGY three and today, activation date. Okay, Senator James. And according to a requirement, this should have got assigned.
Do I need to go to the sandbox Success? So this sandbox allows to run requirements. And Sarah James. Awesome. Got it.
And then what I&#39;m gonna do is on the per on the I do that on the institutional portal. Now I&#39;m doing it from the admin portal, going to templates, create a new one.
Let&#39;s call it Tasha&#39;s paperwork. I&#39;m going to sign this to all users. Sign this for 30th. Automatically assign it for new users.
So this is a bug. It should be, I should be able to click on this text. And it doesn&#39;t need to be bold.
This, this shouldn&#39;t have to be bold. Okay, assign that. Go to the assignments page. This button again, should be on the right side.
There&#39;s a button. All right, I&#39;m gonna say Tasha&#39;s. Paperwork filter. 84 people got it gonna go. And users page add a new user faculty that Tom save and close requirements and assignments.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0746ad1cbbef40b3b63157bce7d65aaa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 6 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>All right. So I wanted to go over these two documents. So this first one, M s P integration notes is work in Progress.
And the idea was to show the relationships and fields that are relevant to M S P E, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than what I have on here.
And then also explain in a step-by-step manner, how do you create and update certain things. And these tables, I copied them from the end, from the API internal.
When you do CSV upload, it shows this table. And this way it&#39;s easy to for someone to quickly reference all the relevant information without having to click into a bunch of end points.
So that&#39;s, this is more of a generic document, and this is meant to be more for what they&#39;re working on now.
And I looked at Chris&#39;s notes, and this is grouped into those sections that Chris mentioned. So, for example, at the top current user API update, using the metrics user stored in banner, create records U and using the custom field endpoints have a, you are URL there and the fields for custom
field, an custom field answers. So what we have to do is provide them with the context for doing some of these things.
For example, in order to update the custom field answers, they also need to know the custom field IDs as well as the custom field options.
So we can have a section for reference data where it shows the options. I mean the field names, as well as the options with the metrics id.
So when they need to send data, they&#39;re able to reference that. I mean, which hopefully they already have since the, they&#39;re already this far into the integration.
I&#39;m trying to create this framework in a way that different clients that are using this can get a one document that contains everything that they need.
So if we need, if you, if if we feel like we need to do this part for a u c, we will, we can go ahead and pull their custom fields.
And for each of them, what are the options with the metrics ID numbers? So the field name options with IDs and the custom field id.
And then once we have that, I&#39;m e I&#39;m explaining here in plain English how to update the value of the existing grade.
So the grade was already created when the revised comment was made. So retrieve the rotation ID from the rotation endpoint.
So it&#39;s important for us to break this up into Like step by step so that it&#39;s easy to follow. And and then they can see it in a, in a a, a, a simple document.
So I copied and pasted the notes that Chris put into the appropriate sections. What we have to do is reorganize it a little bit so that it&#39;s broken up into steps and easy to read for someone that is outside of the company.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/887474d927674322b08891365c9b0984</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>All right guys, so here&#39;s what I was thinking about the PA form. So this is the form here, and what I&#39;m noticing is that we have the same categories of patients or whatever this is being used over and over.
So I was thinking what we can do is take the questions, competencies. We can probably add the core competencies into the milestones so that they could be mapped, but that&#39;s secondary.
So put that there, and that&#39;s not fun. That&#39;s not good. Look in there, but we can improve the formatting a little bit.
And then I was thinking this would be invent fent, and then we would add all of the questions under infant, and then we&#39;d do it again for, let&#39;s call this here you can Do Not know why this is not saving it&#39;s refresh, This is gonna be Children.
So pretty much that&#39;s the plan. We would have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 questions under each of the, each of the forms, I mean each of the categories.
And then they would create the rest of the questions under that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dc7fc8f0f07c42e99c74a4c23f5539f8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 17 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So for the portfolio feature, what we need to do is a few things. One is for submitted evaluations on the assignments page, we&#39;re going to have to add a way for us to attach a file to a review.
So instead of only having a text field, we&#39;re also gonna add a, a thing at the bottom that allows us to attach a file and we want to use something similar to the dashboard.
Attach a file here, something like this so they can drag and drop or drop the files, and then it, when they submit this it&#39;ll show up on that page.
So we wanna make it designed for adding the file and also what it looks like when the file is added.
That&#39;s and then along on the same lines, when a file is added, when a review is submitted by someone, we wanna send an email notification to the other to the evaluate or the evaluate tour.
So if the evaluator is submitting it, we&#39;re gonna send it to the Evaluate, evaluate tour is submitting it, it&#39;s gonna send it to the Evaluate.
And the, if the administrator is adding it, it&#39;ll send it to Bolt. So all we need is a design that shows what that looks like, an email notification, which will show the information about the evaluation from like the te from the teter here.
So the, the, the email shows enough context of who&#39;s evaluating who and the rotation information and, and then it&#39;ll show the review details like we have here.
And then it slightly different design, so it looks good on an email with reviewer is date, time, the comments, and a link to download the attachment.
And and link to that. And then we can also have a button that says write review and then they can go in there so they can write a review, click on it, and that&#39;ll take into a login page where they can write a review.
So those are the changes we need on this page. And then there&#39;s also another task that we had to do for permissions but I don&#39;t know if that one really needs a lot of design.
So I think you can start with this and we&#39;ll do the other one as a separate task to, to summarize, this is going to be a new way to add an, an attachment to a review and then email informing people that review was submitted with enough context in there for them to see what the review is about and a button to submit their own review afterwards.

Thank you. Steven Jackson, director of IT here. Help manage and maintain the information technology services platforms here at The university. Thank you, Steven.
I think that&#39;s everybody. So what I&#39;m going to do is share my screen here, can find the share button, And Before I do that, I will start the recording.
Recording In progress. Okay. So the, the way that the onboarding is going to be structured is it&#39;s gonna be three months where we&#39;re meeting 30 minutes.
And each of those meetings will cover a different agenda item as, as we set up the the platform. And one of the things that wanna pick a date for is like, when do you expect to have students in there?
Is there go live day that you have in mind? Most of our students will start their third year, July 31st of this year.
There may be a couple of sites, maybe like three or four that are a week or two earlier, but for the most part it&#39;s gonna, it&#39;s July 31st.
It&#39;s when our, our next academic year Okay. Will begin. So let&#39;s say if we do like July 15th trying to have everything ready and, and so that you&#39;re able to get the students in there.
And then, yeah, That sounds great. And then yeah, I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s that way you can confirm everything and then send out the invitations.
The other thing is, do you have any thoughts on, so the way that metrics is structured is you have your own server and everything that is related to your school will be log out here is gonna be through access through the one url, and you have your own database, which is for your school.
We can pick, you can pick whatever you are URL you want. It&#39;s, it needs gonna be something dome lab.com. So you can do pyke dome la lab.com.
Do you have any preference on that? In, in my mind, ICOM Okay. Metrics Lab. Perfect. But that&#39;s just my first off.
I, I think that&#39;s probably for the best. So would, we&#39;re expanding, you know, different schools coming on board. So I think kit com keeps our unique focus.
Perfect. Yeah. Is that okay, Steven? From the university point of view? I, I think so. I, I do like the, the sub-domain, you know, you bring on another, another use case and then you could populate that with, with, you know, with that acronym as well.
Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then the this is something that we would work with you Steven, on. We can do single sign-on set up.
That&#39;s not, that&#39;s something that we can coordinate separately. So integration, single sign-on and down the road, once we get going with this, if you want to, I recommend doing integrations with your student information systems.
So that can also be done in parallel. It doesn&#39;t have to be done as part of this. But we could have it so that your SSIS system is sending data into metrics or vice versa.
We have breast APIs for that. And then when you&#39;re ready for having those conversations, we can set up calls for that.
And so the typical clerkship implementation is going to involve moving over your sites rotations the documents that are linked to those rotations, if you want to share those things with the students, setting up the rotation supervisors for each of them.
And then case log templates, evaluation templates, and then all of the users, whether it be students, faculty, and preceptors. And those users are going to have different roles in metrics.
So one of the fir, so this is not really a kickoff meeting, this is sort of a planning meeting during our, our first meeting.
We&#39;ll review the roles that you want to create in the system and standardize that because as you use a system over the years, those standard roles is going help you run reports and make sure you&#39;re aggregating data properly.
And once those roles are in there, then you can, we can also start thinking about getting the users in there and how to group them.
So that&#39;s the user sites. And Maria is gonna be setting up a folder where, where we&#39;ll be sharing a glu Google Drive folder that allows you to access these templates and then fill &#39;em out.
And we&#39;ll review those templates before we send that over to you. And then each, each of those weeks, we, we may have saying, Hey, this week we&#39;re gonna focus on getting all the users in there.
And then all you had to do is update the templates and then Maria will review those and pr if there&#39;s anything that needs to be adjusted, we&#39;ll let you know.
And then we will import those in bulk as part of the first batch. And then in the future, if you need to add users, these imports are available to you in the system, so you can do that yourself.
But the first, first batch will do it so that we&#39;re reviewing the data and, and standardizing it. And for evaluation templates, we will also collect the forms just so that we can review it and see how we wanna organize it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0afcbfc1f4924da898b5f0fd85a6543f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Discovery - Google Docs - 12 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, mark, I&#39;m preparing for this Mount Sinai demo. One of the first things I&#39;m, I&#39;m doing is organizing the notes.
So I want to record this video so that it&#39;s a good opportunity for you to learn about the MS P and also how I&#39;m structuring this.
So I, you learned that the M S P E was generated using an in-house ssis. S SIS stands for student information System and Student information systems are used by universities that have medical schools.
And during student information, it&#39;s not for hospitals and residency programs where they don&#39;t, they don&#39;t use an SISs. And then they&#39;re saying that they saw that information there.
And it&#39;s used to generate the draft version of the letter in Microsoft Word. And then this includes the text and charge of the letter.
And the biggest ch ch challenge that Carlos pointed out was that there are multiple teams working on revisions and multiple individuals within the team working on revisions and, and it is done outside of this software.
So it&#39;s a lot of tedious process of bond going back and forth. The biggest, one of the biggest challenge was notable characteristics.
C our assigned a task of writing Craft versions of three wonderful characteristics. There&#39;s review and then advisors Two, Monitor managed email.
Some of this stuff is a very useful, Delete The whole thing. Okay. Pain point, amount of time while MSP having waits, if there is a way for faculty advisor to see if a student has made crime in real time and back and forth editing while acknowledging that the process is done and rejected and needs revision.
Let&#39;s see. And then editing and Pfizer meeting the student revision and edit. Ms. P e admin editing cleanup. Final sign off.
Okay, so this is step one. My plan here is to organize this and then figure out which of our tools we can use to support them b pe admins and clean up the letter, the document.
So what he was explaining was that these advisors help the students edit their noteworthy characteristics while the school administrators are waiting for that to be done.
It would be ideal if they can work on the other parts of the letter. And when the letter, when the noteworthy characteristic that final are finalized when students slash advisors finalize their part, administrators should be able to update the letter sections out losing the, Okay, So option one we can have a letter like this, we&#39;re editing.
And then if, let&#39;s say this section is coming from a field in the, that a student&#39;s profile, instead of editing this, this part here on the letter itself, we give them a way to edit the field from this page that may have a button on the right side.
And then click on it and I can edit that text. So when I regenerate this letter, it gets populated with a new option, a new, the new content.
Option number two is we let them edit everything and then say, I only wanna regenerate this section. That was a little harder for us to do, but it is doable.
It is nice to see the, Hey, Ken. Hey, Patrick. Just dropped me off in front of the Dunking Donuts. Do I need to pick anything up?
I didn&#39;t order yet. Let&#39;s see. How far are you? I&#39;m like right in front of it. Oh. Let me see.
Oh, what do you want?  Just a sausage, egg, sausage, egg and cheese on muffin. One second. I mean, you can probably just get real the same thing you got last time.
Yeah, I&#39;ll do that. Which one are you at? The 20, I am at 21st and my, All right, let me order there from there.
Turkey sausage egg and cheese on English muffin, right? Yeah. All right. Add Mike wanted sausage, egg, cheese on everything. Bagel.
You want a coffee? Oh, we got coffee. All right, cool. So You have pods, right? Yeah. Yeah. I never, I never used it, so I&#39;m assuming that sh just the pods and the machine should be good, right?
Oh, we need, yeah. I mean, waters at the office. Some kind of milk will be good. I&#39;ll see if I can get that here.
Okay. If not, I can just go to CVS or something. Let&#39;s see. Paying right now. All right. I, I place the order.
It should be three sandwiches. Okay. What&#39;s, what&#39;s the number?  Order number 8 21. Speed. Thank you.

So this is the lead list from the A C G M E conference. And what we need to do is create a create these leads in close, set them up as opportunities.
And I want to go over this document and how it&#39;s organized so that we can do that. And we also need to get out a bunch of emails tomorrow.
So the first thing is well when, I mean tomorrow, I mean today when you&#39;re looking at this video, so the colors the green ones are gonna be the emails that I want you to send out.
The orange ones I&#39;m gonna do myself, cuz I, I have to think about how I&#39;m gonna write that. And the white ones I haven&#39;t decided yet.
They&#39;re lower priority. So the first step is for us to get them into close. And I already looked up the institution and if they already have a link, I added the link here.
And if the link exists, we just have to add the contact and create the opportunity. If the link doesn&#39;t exist, I put in new and or the name so that we can create a new opportunity, the new contact, sorry, the new lead, the new contact, and then the new opportunity for that contact.
It also tell tells us here who the the person that talked to them. So Chris talked to this person, I talked to this person.
And when we are creating a new lead, and here you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a few customs. So if you&#39;re new custom field, we wanna fill out the organization type as gme.
And when we create the custom contact, we wanna make sure we add the conference interaction, and that&#39;s gonna be a C G M E 2023.
And we also wanted to add metrics team interaction. And you can put me and or Chris for who talked to them.
So once those leads are added to send out the emails, we would click new email, select the person. And then I added a template here that says AC G M E 2023, initial follow up.
And we would wanna update the sign signature here to the person that talked to them, put yourself as a cc.
And then in here there&#39;s this sentence that says, during our conversation there&#39;s a phrase here of, what I want you to do is you can copy what I wrote here.
So you could take this and Go here and then do paste. And then for Chris, you would wanna, I guess, update the signature.
I think it&#39;s gonna be hard to get his photo in there. That&#39;s fine. You can, you can just put his name and that&#39;s all.
You can just remove this part for now. All right. And then you can save it as a draft and I&#39;ll do a quick review and send it.
So so this way you can set up everything as a draft and I&#39;ll let me know and then I&#39;ll read it and then I&#39;ll send it.
And then you wanna add yourself as a CC because going forward that way you can follow up. So Chris or I are sending the initial email adding you to it, and then you&#39;re gonna be following up.
So that will be for anything that is green here. So I would start with them add them to the close as new, new contacts on an existing lead or as new leads with new contacts.
And then create opportunities. And then we&#39;ll use the template to send it out. And once the email is sent and the opportunity is created, you can check this off, all right, while you work on the green ones.
Then I&#39;ll work on the orange ones.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ef5957a20b604314bc85d6c514701c82</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 16 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. I went ahead and finished cleaning up the part that I already discussed with the team and I added a couple things.
I was hoping that you can continue with the next phase. So I&#39;m on chop here. You can probably pull up chop staging environment and do the same thing.
If you zoom into the menu that I have here, I have competency graphs, performance, so I&#39;m gonna put this as line.
Then this is the not polar, it&#39;s, I&#39;m gonna leave that for now. And scatter and performance. So these are the I was thinking, I was hoping that you can start with these graphs pages.
So in the design We have, when you look on the graphs page, it will have three tabs, line pull and scatter.
And then for each of those three tabs for the first line graph, what we&#39;re gonna do is apply a similar design as what we have for the polar graphs where you have the whole competency at the top, but it&#39;s gonna be a line graph.
So here is what it looks like now, and we&#39;re basically separating at the charts and the graphs from the data.
So instead of having it show up here, it&#39;ll show up on a dedicated page, but the top part is gonna have all of the competencies.
Actually, you know what, that is gonna be too messy. Instead we&#39;ll have each of the sub-competencies listed out. And then we also wanna put in an instruction at the top that says they can click on the competency to hide and show each of them.
And so it&#39;ll be pretty much like take this line, graphs like that, the key. So it&#39;s gonna be patient care, medical knowledge, and so on.
So, but the key thing that I want you to look at here is the when we&#39;re displaying the line graphs right now, it&#39;s connecting each of the dots.
So if someone gets a a two and a half and a four, all it&#39;s doing is connecting those. What we wanna do instead is show dots,  And then the show dots for the averages.
And then those dots will connect in the best fit line. So on July, 2020 3, 20 22, it had an average of 2.5, and then later on it became four.
And it&#39;s gonna connect those lines together to show the trend. That&#39;s for the line graphs. And then for the polar graphs, we&#39;re not changing anything, it&#39;s just gonna show up at the top and it&#39;s gonna show up the core competency.
And then each of the sub-competencies will have a, a separate chart here. There&#39;ll be six charts, six core competencies, and then one for the common core competency.
And then for the spider graphs will have dots showing up for every submission during that date range, and then have a best fit line connecting them.
So in this case, the best fit line would be, Okay, So those left menu item called graphs, then three tabs.
First tab is going to show The line graphs basically moving these line graphs over. And instead of showing lines, connecting each of them each submission, it&#39;ll show the average for each assignment period, and then connect those averages as for six charts here.
Then the six seven charts here is gonna stay the same core competency. And then each of the sub-competencies, and then scatter plots will show all of this current dots that we show.
And the main thing is we wanna pull this data based on the date the question was assigned, the date the assignment was sent out.
Currently it&#39;s showing question was answered. And then we will show a line graph that goes through it. And a really good tool for us to do is once you select an individual with the date range and run this we, when we switch between the tabs, you want that information to be preloaded if we should be loading it for all three tabs so they can switch back and forth between them.
And I think we could also make the top part a little bit dinner individual that, and this top far can be very similar to what we have at the bottom here.
And then when you collect specific, when you, if you choose specific templates, it&#39;ll show this field here. So that&#39;ll be basically going across the top.
And then we will have the charts underneath it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4f7a68c4f2514ad39bdb0d39304abb0a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Meeting Notes - Google Drive - 10 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So I&#39;ve been working on this during the holiday break, and wanted to finish this up to get it everybody centralized in the note taking.
From what I&#39;m seeing on Jira, doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s where the part of the Documentation doesn&#39;t seem to be working well for everybody in Jira.
Maria has been adding notes, but it&#39;s not really a good method for tracking client notes. It works great for action items and assigning task and things like that.
The, the problem that I see is, one, it&#39;s too many clicks to add the notes, and then also it&#39;s not easy to go back and find previous notes.
So what I was looking into was in drive and seeing if there&#39;s a way to centralize everything here using templates.
So what I did was I created a couple of templates here. These are one is a client profile template that is meant to capture key information and then support is meant to capture the notes from support and it&#39;s in the Temple Gallery, so multiple people can use that.
And then there&#39;s the success. This is meant for any meetings that we&#39;re having. It&#39;s, it&#39;s mainly sales slash success. So anything related to their contract, any big picture goals we&#39;re having an an onboarding and support will go into one document.
And the idea is that inside of this drive, there&#39;s going to be different folders, the pro specs for the sales internals for internal meetings.
Right now I wanna focus on the clients and we&#39;ll have a separate folder for each client. And inside that folder we will have These templates activated.
So here we have the support and then I still need to clean up this one. I was trying it for a couple different re naming structure.
But the idea is that we have this template and then I can add a new row when I have a new meeting, select the type of meeting it is and then insert date for today.
And with this Google functionality of, I can put at and then choose the date, the event insert meeting notes automatically as the attendees notes action items.
And the, the, the goal is that we create these notes while the meeting is happening. And with this format only, this client&#39;s notes will be visible.
So we can share this on the screen and write the, write these notes while the meeting&#39;s happening. And there&#39;s no risk of revealing anything, like if you were to share a Jira task.
And then there&#39;s also a way to put in the meeting duration and prep time. I&#39;ll have to check to see if this can be pulled into somewhere else.
But even if it cannot be pulled, I think it still makes it easy for someone to come in and tally it up at the end of the month.
And then there&#39;s internal notes if you wanna write something else here. And then you can see I used this today morning for the MSU meeting.
And then I can copy and paste it and send it to them. And next time I have a meeting, I could come in here and review my previous notes for the last few meetings and then be ready quickly to continue on to the next meeting.
And anybody else that is working on M Ms U can come in here and review the notes and be up to speed quickly.
And So let me know what you think about this and if you see any areas of improvement or any problems with this.
So what I am thinking is two notes. One is related to us helping them set up and support. And the other one is tied to sales and, and renewals and big picture goals so that those two things are not tied together.
And then the third is just a client profile that&#39;s for links and key things that we need to know about it, such as the modules they have purchased, whether they&#39;re using data warehouse and things like that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a73001c154ef4a7d9470f5be058f93c0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Inbox (483) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 21 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Alejandra. So this is what I was going to go over with you in a call when I&#39;m I have these onboarding meetings with clients and some of our team members also handle different calls and during those meetings we have certain tasks and action items that come up.
So what I&#39;d like to do at the end of the meeting is to send a summary email to those. It&#39;s a weekly meeting that happens.
So for example, today morning, this morning at at nine 30, I had a meeting with Michigan State. So MSU clerkship.
MSU clerkship is to the contact list for that. And then I can create, choose a template. So meeting summary template.
So I go to client onboarding and onboarding check in summary. So I&#39;d like to change the niche name a little bit.
Msu meeting summary. I don&#39;t use this full thing, but it&#39;s great catching. But, and then for my notes here, actually I&#39;m gonna keep it simple cuz it was, my meeting was not as complex, but normally we would have a template like this where we, that fill out and then I would summarize, we discussed.
So we, that was one of the things that we discussed. Let&#39;s see. So I would send this email over to them and then everybody has a summary of what was discussed.
And then I&#39;m gonna put this into meeting notes. So clients, Michigan State support. And this was the meeting that I had today.
I&#39;m just gonna put that here. So this way next time I have a meeting with them, I can always look at the notes from the past and know what I discussed with them.
So this was 30 minutes, 30 minutes, five minutes, 15 minutes, and done, done. So this is indicating how much time I spent on it.
And then the meeting that was the summary was sent.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3d5324d0659e489cb834a1556ae3ed63</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of January 8, 2023 - 10 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Electives. And when you look at &#39;em and the student says, wait a minute, what happened? And you go back and you look where they preference initially was available during that block.
So we don&#39;t really know why the optimizer took it upon itself to do that. But What did you say? So students were sch they were scheduled for that time and the optimizers still gave them a elective.
We&#39;ll put it this way, the student may have preference to go to clinic, a ABC in block three. Yeah. Or an elective.
And then when they got their draft scheduled back, it sent them to clinic Z Y X in a totally different geography.
Yeah. On block three. And then when we went back and looked at it manually, clinic ABC was available during block three.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So we don&#39;t know why it chose to do that. Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s most likely to meet some other requirement so that because all of it is interconnected in some way and to free up another slot for somewhere else, it had to put that person in that that&#39;s, you know, we, we just finished one round with a bunch of requirements like that and, you know, weird things happen.
And it&#39;s where I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same with Evalue. There&#39;s not really any optimizer. It&#39;s, it, it checks for all possibilities and it generates an output.
And then it doesn&#39;t let you say it can&#39;t, you can&#39;t go back and say modify that to a put the student somewhere else, is you have to run the whole thing again and it generates another one.
And it may be completely different than the first one. Yeah. So, so what, what is the, what is the process like, is it something that you&#39;re taking this, that document that you shared with us and they&#39;re running it?
And then are you meeting on a regular basis or what, how do you communicate the changes? And, and tweak things?
So lemme give you two other findings and then we&#39;ll go back into that. So another finding, we had several students who were equine focused students.
They want to do equine medicine and they, they preference that way and the optimizer gave &#39;em all small animal Rotations.
Oh, wow. Okay. So we went back and changed it manually. And I, I think the solve for that is a rule to, to kind of, to the point that if they preference, if they say they&#39;re an equine student, then don&#39;t give any small animal.
Yeah. But we can take care of that. The other thing that was a finding was the computer. And, and we know this, that doesn&#39;t geotag or take into account.
So they have a student in Nashville for one block, San Antonio, Texas, for the next block and then back to Memphis, Tennessee for the next block, Which Makes no Sense.
Yeah. And so I think we can write a rule that says if computer, if you&#39;re not giving them what they referenced, then find them another place in that hub.
Yeah. We have our site identified by Hub. Yeah. So at least they&#39;re not going across the country. Yeah. But we had 103 schedule request to change a schedule involving 47 students.
And it&#39;s taken us about three days so far to get all those cleared. Most of &#39;em are pretty simple. So it was better this year than it has been in the Past.
Yeah. We just haven&#39;t achieved perfection yet. And then, so, so in terms of the hub, it&#39;s so you are gonna be defining which sites belong in a hub.
Cause I, I do have that written down as something that we&#39;re gonna try to do as a geographic one of the constraints being geography.
But one of the things we were debating about is like how to handle that geography as you know, what states are.
But if you have it sort of grouped together as these sites are part of the same hub, then that makes it easier because then we can say, here&#39;s a group of sites that we can treat as, you need to put the, if someone is in this hub for a rotation, the next one has to be within the same hub.
But the, but then the problem or, well, the other thing is we have to say preferentially that hub, but if nothing&#39;s available, they have to go somewhere else.
All right. Yeah. So those are, yeah. And I think there&#39;s one of the custom fields, their sites is, is hub, I believe.
And another one of the custom fields sites is species that they treat. So I think we can key on their small animal.
They&#39;re mixed animal, they&#39;re, they&#39;re equine only. And then we can help the, the optimizer guide it that way as Well.
Yeah. To Answer, to answer the, the question you asked just before that was, the way that we typically have done this with Evos is getting into the scheduling season.
We set up a call with them, we talk about what&#39;s going on, our timeline, et cetera. Then we start working on rules and we have another call with them to go through the rules.
You know, many of them are carried over from last time. Some of them are new, some of them are no longer needed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/903f875720ae4ab4b9e3834625080927</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>SUNY Upsate - Google Docs - 9 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>&lt;affirmative&gt;. Yeah. So I&#39;ll give an example of, you know, there&#39;s this course called p2p and there&#39;s 17 small groups with 10, 12 students each.
And so the P2P course coordinator will create groups in an Excel spreadsheet. Then from there, and then we have certain dates that it&#39;s offered and all the students have it at the same time.
So that&#39;s a more simple one. But there are different groups. Yeah. Then we have a room scheduling software called that&#39;s upstate wide called 25 live.
Yeah. Then we request the rooms from those people that handle the rooms, and then we at the rooms to like the, it&#39;s all spreadsheet, pull out a pdf and it gets posted in Brightspace, which is the LMS right now we&#39;re using.
Yeah. So They have like a general schedule in 25 that pushes out to their calendar that will say they have P2P from 10 to 11.
Yeah. But Then out which room they&#39;re in, they need to go back and look at that pdf. Got it. It Usually the same one every session, but sometimes it changes because the rooms get shifted.
And there&#39;s things like clinical experiences where they might have a nursing shadowing once per year. Every student does it once per year.
Yeah. So that&#39;s another Excel spreadsheet, another PDF that they have to cross reference with their own Schedule is Okay. It&#39;s tedious for everyone.
And then there&#39;s also, this is something that, you know, we see a few times across. You&#39;re not the only school that has been doing this.
And the other thing to factor in is you know, every student can see every other student&#39;s schedule like Right. So if it&#39;s on the pdf, then that&#39;s you know, one of the schools that we mentioned, they said they had like a safety issue because, because the students know where somebody else is going to be, even though they&#39;re not in their group.
Didn&#39;t Think about that. Yeah, I didn&#39;t think about it either. The dean brought that up and I was like, that&#39;s, that&#39;s and we do handle the scheduling and metrics individually.
Like it&#39;s, it&#39;s something that if you&#39;re scheduled into the a, a lecture with a group attached to it, you only see your group and you don&#39;t even see the students that are in the group until you get there.
You, it&#39;ll tell you which, which group you&#39;re in, and then what other groups are part, part of that event. And then when you get there, you, you can find out who&#39;s part of that.
So that being said, besides scheduling what about other things like if you&#39;re what about evaluations for clerkship? How is that handled?
So we have, excuse me, we have MedHub right now. Okay. And that piece is like a gme pushed thing. So and an rfp, so our state institution also.
So we can&#39;t change that until, yeah. The RFP contract is, is up and then we&#39;re not the drivers of that decision.
We have a say. Okay. That help right Now. And then what what about case logging? Are you doing case logging for students?
Mm-hmm. Okay. What do you mean by case Logging? Like when they go to a particular rotation, are they logging what diagnosis they saw?
Like if I go to pediatrics, I have to meet certain pediatric ca cases. Would that be like Epic?  Well, they, they would get that information from the patients that they saw.
Like if I&#39;m about, if I&#39;m on a pediatric rotation, am I seeing enough diagnosis in certain, certain you know, or if I go to OB B G Y N I have to watch X deliveries and then I check it off as cuz that&#39;s the, the other thing that is, is useful to do be, and, and because of two reasons.
One is obviously to make sure that they&#39;re getting exposure to the enough patients. And the second is it also gives you enough evaluation of the, the site if they are able to provide an outpatient population for that rotation.
Because if you have, if you have multiple students going there and they&#39;re not meeting their requirements then you know that there&#39;s a problem.
It&#39;s not an individual student not taking the initiative to see the different types of cases. Yeah, so I, I am not involved with the second, the phase two we call it.
Okay. Clinical clerkship. But I think if we were to move to a solution, having it fit their needs would be ideal.
And so I just wanted to talk to someone to make sure that this is even a direction. You know, it&#39;s hard to tell what exactly a program does from like the website.
Yeah, I know Sure. That it at least met the needs of what we were talking about first and then we could expand some clinical Stuff.
Yeah, absolutely. So what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll give you a big picture overview today since we only have 30 minutes.
And then depending on your feedback on it, we can schedule additional meetings and they&#39;re, depending on what institute what, what you&#39;re purchasing.
We usually have several meetings with different administrators and different decision makers and deans. It, so this is today is gonna be a big picture overview.
Lemme Ask do you, does anyone in the Sunni system use Vetrix that you know Of? Sunni. Let&#39;s see. It just makes it easier if we know that it works with the all the back ends.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f3e6e3a01d144dea997eb2193ed14c1c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Elizabeth. So this is the development environment for Michigan State. We copied a backup of your database and when you log into this, you&#39;re not gonna use your normal email address.
It&#39;s gonna be at an ID number 5 94 A metrics dot f and I set the password to M SSU 1 23.
And this is your actual account on your production. But when we load backup of a client data into a development environment, we would, we don&#39;t pull in any full names and we use an ID number.
And the other thing that we do is we hide all of the site names. It&#39;s basically anything client specific we obfuscate.
So when you&#39;re testing on this, it&#39;s gonna be a little different than your regular environment. You just gotta use one of these one of these users that match the role that you&#39;re looking for.
So let&#39;s say we wanna work with a OMS three student. Thank you. If we can find the test. Yeah, test student is still here.
You can use that one. And then you can edit demographics and change the password if needed. Here, change the password.
And then for rotations, You still have all of the rotations that you have on your production here. And if you need to make any changes, you can make that here.
And then the schedules are also there. So everything else is gonna be the same. The only thing that is gonna be different is the names are hidden and the site are hidden.
So if you have to if, if you need to test something, it would either have to simply look at the site ID numbers to make sure that it&#39;s matching it, it applies to what you&#39;re looking for.
So, for example, if you&#39;re asking the student, if the student is asking to switch from one site to the other, when you&#39;re testing it out, you&#39;ll see that the ID number has changed for that particular rotation.
So aside from that, everything else should be good. And this, this server doesn&#39;t send out any emails to any users.
So feel free to u do whatever you want and it doesn&#39;t bother any of the students or the or, or the other administrators.
And when you&#39;re done, let me know and if you have any feedback, we can try to incorporate that before we release this feature.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/db60d81848384fa69a362ad259a1e236</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Setup Google Calendars</pre></td><td><pre>One of the first things that you wanna do is set up the calendar to show all of the different team members.
So if you go to the Google Calendar, calendar.google.com, on the left side, it shows all the calendars you guys subscribed to.
And if you don&#39;t see all of the team members here, you can go in here plus subscribe to calendar and select different individuals.
And once they&#39;re added, you can turn on the events using the little checkbox and you can see their calendar. So if I want to schedule a meeting with mark, for example, I can choose Mark and then I can see his availability and when I can schedule it.
And when I schedule this, once Chrome is set up, you can use this to select Chrome or Google Meet for the the meetings internally.
It&#39;s okay to use Google Meet if necessary. Externally, we always use zoom. Another thing that you can do on the calendar is to go and set up you&#39;re availability here and also the time zone if confirm it&#39;s correct.
And then for event settings, change the default meeting time to 30 minutes So that it&#39;s not one hour. And that&#39;s where you&#39;re setting things up in Google Calendar.
However, syncs front is synced with Google Calendar. Once everything is set up, you can manage all the events and calendars directly from front.
So if I wanted to schedule a meeting with Chris, I can turn that on and then click into it to create my event.
So it&#39;s easier to keep managing all this from front since it is all in one place. But for the initial setup, you have to go into Google.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/acce16b23292488ba9c7f50672909b0d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Team KPI Reporting - Google Sheets - 9 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Maria, I was looking at the KPIs and it looks good. The, I was debating between the horizontal versus vertical orientation of these dates.
And I was looking at the screenshot that you sent me, and I am leaning towards this, this setup because it leads to less maintenance and less clicking, cuz each person can simply go in there and fill out the column and it&#39;s easy to see who&#39;s done what and who&#39;s missing something.
If you do it like this, it&#39;s gonna be a like we had to keep copying this over and over and over, and it&#39;s gonna be hard to keep track of who&#39;s done what.
If it&#39;s like this, we can just keep it like this and then scroll horizontally to keep track of this. And I&#39;d like to have, after each week a comment.
So it&#39;ll be Jan six comment, Jan 13th comment, and so on. And then for for this other sheet, I think we&#39;re gonna have to do it this way because we have to capture the client data.
There&#39;s not, there&#39;s not really any way to get around it, but for the first sheet, it&#39;s, it&#39;s easier to keep track of it if we do it horizontally.
And I also added a client help sheet here. And the idea here is same thing as the KPIs, wanna list out all the clients.
Then for each week people to go in there and update the status as whether they&#39;re a client that is so happy, they&#39;re advocating for us, or they&#39;re just average and stable or need some attention.
And then at comments field, this shouldn&#39;t be a dropdown. So that way I can look at both of these sheets and quickly make a decision on where I need to focus some attention.
And this sheet is something that you&#39;ll probably look at to get totals and get a idea of how much money we&#39;re spending on support for different types of clients.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4730bf1a25a4973928638c76061e182</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Product Update Email Content Planner - Google Docs - 9 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So, hi Le. So this project is going to be for us to draft some updates on features that we&#39;ve released recently through the platform, and these are the different modules, and I&#39;m gonna be going through each of them.
And what I&#39;d like you to do is take, create a title and a description. So this is gonna be an email notification that goes out that summarizes what we built.
And and then basically sh explains the value proposition to the client, and it&#39;s gonna be sent to clients and not for, not to sales leads.
This first The feature that we released is for our outbound module, and we can start off with an introduction of the outbound modules.
It says, outbound module is a advanced notification system that allows organizations to build custom email alerts based on various business rules.
And this add-on for metrics can be used for sending out reminders for things like ex late e evaluations or low score notifications when someone performs poorly.
And this update that we re we are releasing would allow organizations to add more rules to the audience members so that they can target specific roles within the organization so that they can send the email to the right person at the right time.
The sec, second one, I will let Chris speak about this one. Actually, maybe hold on. Yeah, so actually I, I&#39;ll go over it.
So this is a feature that we added for our case logs module that will allow the organization to customize the case duration setting.
So we, A case log is a log that a trainee puts into their record that says they saw a patient or performed a procedure.
And this this addition to that module allows the organization to say, anytime a student is logging a case, specify the minimum number of minutes to X minutes, or maximum number of X minutes, and then, and the format to be minutes or hours.
And we can tell, we can also include a, include a, a, a sentence that says, to customize the setting, go to system, set up settings, and go to cases section to adjust these parameters.
So this next update is also for the case logs module, when this new setting would allow an or a trainee to save some time when logging a case, if they are working in a certain rotation, as soon as they select this case date, metrics would automatically choose the appropriate preceptor for that rote for that case based on the rotation that they&#39;re scheduled to.
In order for this to be configured properly, they have to enable the setting under systems set up and make sure that all the rotations have rotation supervisors.
I&#39;ll let Chris handle this one, make a note of that. So this feature, we actually renamed this to academic progress, will allow an organization to share with their students how, what courses and rotations they have been scheduled to and, and the progress towards their requirements.
So if this can be enabled under system setup settings, and once the setting is turned on students will see a, a page that lists out total number of weeks or hours that are required for the training and how many courses and rotations they were scheduled to, to meet that total hours and weeks.
This update to our user import CSV will allow organizations to make updates to all the user fields as long as the email address matches an existing user in the system.
So let&#39;s say John Smith needs to change, have his address changed when we upload a spreadsheet, as long as John Smith&#39;s account is in metrics and the email address matches metrics will update the address field based on that.
So it allows the, or the benefit here is that organizations can do bulk update of the user&#39;s fields based on what, based on what the email address.
I&#39;ll let Mike handle this one. This new feature for the student portal would allow the students to filter by courses so that they can turn a diff, turn a course on and off, and it shows up on the calendar instead of just seeing everything they can choose the courses they wanna see.
And this make it look cleaner. This new feature that was released will allow administrators to specify which fields in the platform, which user fields are editable by the, by the user.
So if they have trainees and faculty in the system and they want the trainees and faculty to sub submit their own information instead of the administrator having to add it, we can enable that enable editing by the training or a faculty member, and they&#39;ll be able to go in there and submit that information from their profile instead of administrators having to manage it.
This new feature is a big one. This will allow students and residents to submit requests to change a rotation that they&#39;re scheduled to.
They can submit, they can look at a sch their personal schedule and request their schedule to be adjusted to a new rotation that is, that they have been approved for.
If for students, it&#39;s essentially they&#39;re finding electives they want to do and they&#39;re submitting an approval request to have that elective approved and scheduled on their calendar.
So the title of this can be ability for Ability to ma Ability to Manage Elective rotation requests and ro rotation Change Requests.
And the description of this would be saying that with this new update organizations can streamline the management of elective rotations and collect applications for those electives as well as manage change requests from students and residents who want to switch out a an elective rotation.
This feature will include, this feature includes the ability for administrators to review and update these, these changes and also have an approval process where the schedule is updated when the administrator approves that request.
The new feature here is the site rotator report was fully updated with a whole new interface that is interactive and Ability gives the administrators the ability to filter data quickly before they export it, instead of having to export it and then look at the data, they can see the information on the screen in real time, pick out what they need and then export it to a spreadsheet.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f8fc8410ac014555a8d3099ade7a8aff</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Case Log</pre></td><td><pre>Hi everyone. When we initially presented metrics, we were focused on the competency management, which is closely tied to the evaluation schedules, modules.
We didn&#39;t get into the case logging because you do collect cases as part of the students clerkship. However, it&#39;s not tied directly to the competencies.
So competencies can be assessed using an evaluation form about the case logs, but it&#39;s not directly going to those competencies.
So that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t really get into that in as part of the initial demo. But since based on our last conversation, it sounds like we need to have this set up also.
So here is how case logs work. Under the administrative side, we&#39;re able to create these templates, and these templates have different names and fields that can be turned on and off.
So family medicine, internal medicine clerkship can have its own case law templates with various fields that can be enabled. There&#39;s also a way to link specific diagnosis and specific procedures with a type of clerkship.
So, so the internal medicine clerkships can have a set of procedures and diagnosis. Pediatrics can have a difference set of procedures and diagnosis.
And then for each of those, you can also define the minimum that is required. So how many asthma exasperations do the students have to see as part of their rotation, or how many ve puncture do they have to do as part of their rotation?
And once these templates are created, the students can start logging those cases and we automatically capture which rotation these cases are done in based on their schedule.
So if I log in as a student here, Cole, And then go to the dashboard. You can see cases are in the left menu, and these are all the case logs that we have logged this Cole.
And when I wanna, when I&#39;m on my family medicine rotation, I would see the family medicine template or internal medicine rotation, also the internal medicine template.
Click new case, and then I can fill in the necessary fields. Not all these fields are required. You can disable the ones you don&#39;t need.
And once you select date, any of the schedules that they&#39;re scheduled to work will pull in a rotation. I don&#39;t think the student has anything scheduled.
Actually, there we go. You can see I, I put in May 3rd, and it&#39;s linked to this rotation. And you can also define which diagnosis the patient has and we keep track of what&#39;s been completed.
Same thing for a procedure, and then say that three required fields are missing. So let&#39;s put in age, gender safe.
Now if it doesn&#39;t require supervisor approval, it&#39;s approved immediately. If it requires supervisor approval, it&#39;ll send that to that supervisor as an email or text message for approval.
And then under the diagnosis scene tab, the student can always keep track of what&#39;s been seen, what&#39;s left to see, and whether the requirement has been met for each rotation.
And on the administrative side, they&#39;re able to do this also and run filters to see what&#39;s been done by certain students in what setting?
So this module is something that handles all the case logging for both of diagnosis and procedures, and allows for students to keep track of their progress and administrators to assess data across multiple sites for their organization.
And then to tie these two competencies, you create a form that someone at the, at the site can fill out based on how the students are doing on these case logs.
And that will feed into the milestones of competency data. Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
It also includes those email notifications for approvals.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b2e955c30c8d46c09fc1f317edafd8c9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Quote - Google Docs - 28 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>This is Claudia Gynecology calling a transvaginal ultrasound.

So as you may know, this week or last week, there was a big announcement in AI world with this release of chat, G B T, which came from open ai, the company that&#39;s been focusing on building AI tools that is accessible to the world in a, without knowing how to program.
So this new tool I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve been playing around with it and I feel that this makes a lot of the things that we&#39;ve been talking about obsolete, essentially.
And we should update the proposal to use this tool as a primary way to conduct the research. And it&#39;s already gained worldwide attention, and it&#39;s probably going to be something that all the NIH people are gonna be discussing and, and, and on top of the list.
And essentially it allows us to do what we need to do from an AI perspective.  And they&#39;re gonna be providing, right now, this is available free for research and they&#39;re gonna be providing this as a software tool that you can access and do different things with.
So I&#39;ve been messing around with this quite a bit. And I wanna show you some of its potential uses. So for example, these are some sample reports that I pulled from the internet.
So if I take this CT of the abdomen and published report, this came from this website here, they publish it online, and you can see that this report is not even formatted or structured.
The radiology reports that we put out are structured. And what I mean by that is if I zoom in, actually I don&#39;t even have a good example here.
Our reports, my reports, for example, they start with a section like long basis, and then I write about the run along basis, then liver, then I write about the liver.
So these are, this is somewhat structured in that it&#39;s organized in the sentences, but still not into using a separate section for each, an atomic anatomic structure.
So if I go back here, this, this is the older way that radiology reports were written where it says one big paragraph or a couple of paragraphs.
So let me show you what chat AI can do. So I&#39;m gonna copy that text and paste it here. And then I&#39;m gonna ask this thing, can you explain this to me?
Like I am a 10 year old. You can see that it starts explaining it to me like I&#39;m a 10 year old.
It, it says that there&#39;s a ct, a ct, what, what is a CT scan? Small bulge in the patient&#39;s belly button.
So it probably has a hernia. And I looked at a few of these and they are accurate. It&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s correct and it simplifies it and it&#39;s like super impressive.
And the other thing is, it&#39;s also only picking when I, maybe not on this report, but another report is only picks out what&#39;s positive.
Like it doesn&#39;t waste sentences explaining negative finding, which I was even more impressed by. So like, let&#39;s try another one here.
So this is saying that the, the spleen is normal in size. So I&#39;m gonna take this report and go through this time.
Can you, like, I am a year old curious what This is called hepatic theosis. And it can happen if a patient eats too much food with a lot of fat in it, then the doctor saw a tiny rock.
This is, this is amazing. It&#39;s better than like, what Mindy and I explained it. We never used the word rock.
Like it eliminates the curse of knowledge problem. And you can see that it didn&#39;t mention anything about the spleen because it&#39;s ignoring anything that&#39;s, that&#39;s that doesn&#39;t need to be mentioned.
And, and this is not this, this is only a tip of the iceberg. Let&#39;s see, what are we, let&#39;s see if I wanna do something else, all of them in here and say, oh, look at that.
That&#39;s, I gave too many multiple reports. So let&#39;s do something where explain what is on with my liver, bladder, pancreas, Kidney, knees and Bladder Eye And a school student.
See, because I now asked specifically about the liver, pancreas, and spleen, it&#39;s now including those details. Let&#39;s try one more thing.
You can put it in bullet format. This is amazing. What should I do next? They should do next. So I think we need to do something with this tool.
Maybe even as simple as taking a bunch of radiology reports. You know, like I can maybe prepare a bunch of sample reports and then we could do some form of study where this tool simplifies it and we can ask a bunch of the radiologists or other doctors or even the mechanical Turk people their feedback on the simplified versions of this chat, D B T.
And I think this will may help our pa proposal stand out since this tool just came out. And, and I see a lot of other ways that we, this can be used.
So one of the, I mean the simplest thing is like what we were planning on doing was sending data from the radiology software to a trained model and then taking that data and feeding it back to the doctor.
So right now the API for this chat is not available. I think you&#39;re gonna only interact through this tool. Let me make sure and you can sign up for this and try it out yourself.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4a287d5689584e28b1aee763215a7ed9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>License Detail - Gurobi Optimization - 29 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey key. So here is the video that I promised of the optimizer. So what I&#39;m doing here is opening up vs code And bringing up the optimizer code.
And you can see this spreadsheet shows of all the different rules that the school sent for us to apply for each of these courses.
These are the different courses. These are different courses, and it tells us what weeks they&#39;re offered what days of the week.
It&#39;s offered that the number of students that are allowed in each of them, whether or not they need to take it once during the semester, more than once, whether it&#39;s an elective mandatory.
So there&#39;s all these rules that go with each of these courses. And the optimizer, it&#39;s a contained tool. Here we have the model dot pie, which has a bunch of the variables, the main dot pie, which has the different constraints.
The two things, the two files that we mainly work with are the student&#39;s file, which shows all the students preferences.
So you can see student here and whi which electives they prefer and is ranked in order. And the optimizer tries to include that their top preference when it tries to bake the schedule.
The, the, the whole goal of the optimizer is to take all the courses in a semester, all the availabilities and rules, all the students&#39; preferences, and then generate a optimal schedule for the school that meets all the requirements and maximizes the student&#39;s performance.
I mean student&#39;s preferences. And then it outputs the schedule that we can import into metrics and, and, and give it to the students.
So it&#39;s a one click process to generate the schedule. The tricky part is that all of these constraints overlap with each other.
So this constraint file allow us to define the rules for a particular school, and we&#39;re often coming in here and adjusting different parameters to make the schedule work.
So one of the things that we have to be able to do is modify this tomo file quickly so that we can run it and if something doesn&#39;t work, we have to come back here and make a change and then run it again.
And the way that we run it is using a tool called Garbe, which we are licensing from the company and s see optimizer.
So I have this on my local drive and then I&#39;m gonna activate my virtual environment. And then I run a command inside the client&#39;s folder and command that I run Is this end.
So Python three do slash do do main dot pi, and it gives it the start date, the first day of the semester, the solver name, which isbi that we license.
And the timeout 300 seconds so that it stops after 300 seconds if I need to. Sometimes it goes over for a lot longer, but most of the time it&#39;s less than 300 seconds.
So I do do this. What it does is looks at all the rules that I&#39;ve set up and generates the schedule.
And if it cannot generate the schedule because it&#39;s ma not mathematically possible, it would give us a result of being infeasible.
So that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been using it. And Chris Rio and Chris are also using it on the local. What we have to do is set it up on the cloud.
And for that I set up this Docker instance here with our a free account. It&#39;s not the metrics one. And on this I&#39;ve installed G**o already, and currently it&#39;s installed under route.
And but in order for me to apply the license, I also have to install their license tools. So there is a file that I downloaded Called this file that I&#39;ll To license it.
So the license file needs to be installed, and then once the license file is installed, I have to run this command to license it.
And after that, anybody can connect to the s SSH and run this as needed. So one of the things that I&#39;m hoping that you can help with is install the license file and then run this command.
And afterwards if we can also give some guidance on how we can edit this tomo file quickly and get it back on the site so that we can run it.
So this tomo file is gonna be on the Digital Ocean droplet and we have to be able to edit it and then update it quickly so that we can run this over and over.
Maybe there&#39;s a tool that we can use to do that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e1affe0ddc0d4dc498f8124d092832dc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Dev: 2023-02-06 - Jira - 8 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So for this first one outbound I can, well, I, I&#39;m Chris, or I can write about it. The, one of the things that we want to emphasize for outbound is that it is a paid module.
So we want to, they can contact us if they need that module. And then next one. Yep. So this, yeah, I will let you and Chris figure that one out And yeah, these are all features bug at a simple history.
We don&#39;t need that case based on, yeah, so this, so some of these in addition to the highlighting the new change to that thing, like for example, community benefit report even though it&#39;s a small change to that report, it&#39;s an opportunity for us to highlight that report to our clients cuz they may not know about the fact that we have a community benefit report.
So it&#39;s like community benefit report and one sentence of what that is and then what we changed. So I, I mean, I think the best way to do this is to set up a template and then me and Chris can go in there and add the text rather than you trying to look into every single one of these.
Cause it&#39;ll take too long to figure, figure out. Cuz like if I wrote up the issue, then I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll be able to write something about it.
If Chris wrote the issue, then Chris will be able to write something about it rather than each of us trying to decide for what someone else wrote up.
Okay. Well he can, if he doesn&#39;t know how to edit it, he can just like, look at this, look at the screenshot and say, here&#39;s a text for it.
Yeah. So here&#39;s that one bug. Yeah, yeah. That&#39;s a feature. Allow CSV to auto update existing user fields based on, so this one, even though it&#39;s remove side tool.
Okay. Not visible to Okay. Bug. Oh yeah, that&#39;s, that&#39;s a good one. Okay. So that&#39;s that bug. This one is good when adding a new section with a lot of questions.
Page break. That&#39;s book left nav. Okay. This one is, even though it&#39;s a cleanup job, I think it&#39;s good for people to know about the settings page Rework, interface fields, primary, secondary, that&#39;s bug.
Actually, no, it&#39;s not a bug. That&#39;s it was, oh yeah. This is a huge one. This one I think deserve.
It may not be something that we want to include in this first one. We can probably send that as a, as a stand standalone email.
Yeah. Yep, Yep, yep. That&#39;s a huge one. Next weekend? Yeah, I think so. I think Wednesday, Thursday or Friday? Wednesday.
Friday, I think, yeah, I mean, I&#39;m, I think I&#39;m gonna basically, except for like external meetings, I might be taking Monday and Tuesday off, cuz I can&#39;t really take both days off because I have meetings, sales meetings and stuff already.
But given that &lt;inaudible&gt; took off Monday, Tuesday and tried to do these part, the part of the day off. Yep.
Okay. No, no, it&#39;s funny. I, like, I, we don&#39;t see each other ever because we work opposite schedules and we just text each other some, like when we need to swap stuff.
Okay. One second. Let&#39;s see, am I on Copy? The, No, that&#39;s, that needs, that is not ready to be announced.
Too much going on behind. We gotta fix that up. But we have so many updates we haven&#39;t told people about.
Yeah, I, I, I think, I think it&#39;s best to start with the Google doc so that we can get you the content and then you work on the the how to put that together.
So like once so for example, like, like we can, in the Google Doc, what we want to do is have a, the title, a brief prescription, a screenshot, and then also like, we wanna have some sort of like tagging system where it&#39;s, whether it&#39;s for I think two ba major buckets is university clients versus hospital clients.
And then so that some, for example, grade book and stuff, if it&#39;s not a hospital client, they&#39;re never gonna use that.
So if we, if we can like when for these product updates, if we can have a way to tag it as client type and module, then as we send these out regularly, people start getting used to that.
I meant like in the email itself, like let me see if I can, I mean it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s mainly a design thing.
It&#39;s like basically making it clear to when someone&#39;s scanning through the email they can identify which one is relevant to that.
Yeah. And like, let&#39;s see, group members, okay, so that&#39;s all of it. And then it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of like if you have the email coming, we&#39;ll have, this is the title of the release then right under it or something.
We have one tag for module and that&#39;ll be one color. I, I mean, instead of hospital universities, we can call it clinical and preclinical.
That&#39;ll be clinical for us. Right now they&#39;re not using it for, and then module and, and at the bottom maybe we can have like a reference or whatever what that means.
Or, or if we want to be very clear, explicit, we can say client type clinical and yeah. That may be better.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6fa59037b2cd4ac990e13ae192865b8d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>SIS Integration Overview</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mary. Wanted to create this video to explain how an integration with an SI system would work. And if there are more technical questions, I can arrange a call with our one of our product team members with your it, if they wanna talk, any, any details on how the integration would work.
Normally, the processes, we would meet with your IT team, discuss the details of integration, and then we put together a document that outlines specifically how that integration should be done.
And we create that document so they can follow a step by step and complete that. And I&#39;m gonna also share with you this document.
The, this is something that we&#39;ve documented for another client for banner integration. It&#39;s it&#39;s not the same S I S U B you&#39;ll be using, but it&#39;s from the same company.
So it, it may overlap with the, the processes. But what we normally would do is create a custom document like this for your technical team to do the integration.
So I wanna go over a few items here. The first is our student accounts, student accounts are synced using their student id.
So in metrics, we capture an ID number for each user. This includes the employee or trainee number, and your single sign-on as well as your integration with your ssis is done using this ID so that ID would match in one system and the integration would check to see if that user exists in the other system and either update that record or create a new account.
If there&#39;s a new student added to to the sis s a new user can be pushed into metrics. So that&#39;s the first sync that can happen.
Then we also have in our great book a full roster of all of the courses that are created in the student information system.
And this includes your rotation courses as well as your preclinical courses. And they, they have a code associated with it.
This code would match what is in the SSIS s platform. So both platforms can sync using this code. So if a student is enrolled in OB G Y N, then we know that where to put the grade.
So by having the second integration, which is to sync the course details, then metrics will know which grades match with which courses.
And then using our schedules and metrics, we&#39;ll Be able to also tie that into a specific timeframe when they completed that.
And then inside of grades, we have ability to track rotation grades, as well as course grades. And each of these have some details that can be customized, including the score type pass fail whether it&#39;s honors.
These are something that we, these are items that we customize as part of the onboarding process. So essentially we would sync the students, then we would sync the course details, and then grades are synced based on those course details.
There&#39;s also another integration that can be done, which is for schedule details. So the student information system may need scheduling information from metrics.
So if your clerkship team is using metrics as the primary source of scheduling or primary location where the scheduling is done, you can set up an integration where the class detail is used to update student information system with the, the start date and end dates of when students completed different courses.
And if I sh go into the schedule, there is also now an option to track different enrollment statuses. So using an integration, if a student is enrolled in a a course in the student inform information system, that can flow into metrics.
And this would allow the scheduler to know that they&#39;re enrolled and they can go ahead and finalize the schedule. If someone is not enrolled in the campus solution system, then the scheduler can be informed that they should not be scheduled.
And if if there&#39;s also one piece that we&#39;re still working with one of our clients to add, is there any hold status?
So if a student has a hold on their account in the SIS s system, that would also be synced into metrics once that update is released.
But right now you can sync the users, the courses, the schedules as, as well as the enrollment status. So hopefully that was helpful in answering your question.
And if we need to have a call to discuss this, this in more detail, let me know and we can put something on the calendar.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4b948e17deec4729bbde5ab54025f9b5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Site Rotator Report</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, everyone wanted to share this update with you. We were able to resolve the, the the small problem that was on the new release that happened yesterday.
So you can go in there and take a look at this report. Thank you for your patience. And this is a completely new format for this report, and it&#39;s gonna make it easier to find what you need and not ha and, and, and also less time to filter through this data because you&#39;re able to apply these filters and see that information show up in real time at the bottom without having to export it to Excel.
And by default, it&#39;s gonna go to the this month. So if I refresh this page and come back here, it&#39;ll go to December.
I can always expand the date range. I can also select individuals. Now, if I choose one student, it&#39;ll always show schedules for that student.
Also filter by sites. And as we click on this, you can see things update on the bottom. And if you click this option button, you can also exclude shifts and only see the rotations at the top right.
There&#39;s also an Excel button, so any data that&#39;s shown below, you can export it to Excel. And this is going to show up in the same format that you used to.
It&#39;s gonna show the results that are here with some more details. Not all the details are shown on this page.
The Excel will give you a little bit more context and it&#39;s gonna look exactly like the one that you were, you were using in the past.
We also added the pending enrollment and status here, and the campus solutions section number and class number will show up here once they&#39;re integrated.
So hopefully this, this report will make it easier for you to find all the data and export it. And there&#39;s also an option now to click and have this report exported and email to you with the, with the click of the button.
Please let us know if there&#39;s any questions and any feedback that you have on this. Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4e9fe317872d4222bee9daf02ff52454</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU Questions/Issues - 12.05.2022 - Google Docs - 5 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mitch. So going into these items here, for the first one, the recommendation is to use the role that will give the most automation when it comes to evaluations.
So if most of the evaluations are going out for principal, clinical educator, give her the role. And then the other items can be handled using groups.
So we can set up a group for course mentor, and those groups can be used to assign any other tasks and metrics and also can be used to send out announcements For the second video for custom fields, the standard fields that we have in there, we don&#39;t have a way to turn that off right now.
This is something that we can have a, an update added that allows you to disable certain fields. In the future hopefully by the time the students get in there, we&#39;ll try to have an update that allows us to turn those off.
And then for reorganizing the site demographic fields, I mean the user demographic fields, when we do the site demographic fields, we&#39;re also including a feature that allows sorting of these demographic fields.
So when we apply that to the site, it&#39;s gonna also work for the users and then we can use that to rearrange it, that as we see fit.
And it is possible right now, but it requires a little bit more effort. If once we add this new update, you&#39;ll be able to do that yourself.
And I also suggest to the team that we add a standard custom field for state, so that it doesn&#39;t have to be manually created.
And I, when we talk on Thursday, I wanna discuss our documents and certification sections cuz the licenses may maybe best handled over there.
And I can, we can go into the pros and cons of that. So, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll get into this a little bit more when we talk on Thursday.
This one having our colleague look at it and yeah, this, this appears to be a bug when it&#39;s, it&#39;s getting laid out into a, into a horizontal orientation.
It breaks out of the, the screen. So we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll update that formatting so that it&#39;s vertical. And yes, we do for this next one.
Next one we do send out email that is also an SMS option, and they can complete that without logging in.
We&#39;re also looking into this common field, and I believe we looked into this. I see notes from Marie already. We have it.
Let me turn this note field off, then it will remove the It&#39;ll remove the the notes from the so I, I&#39;ll follow up with this and I wanna speak to Maria about this.
I believe what you mentioned in the video was that it, the note or field was not showing up on the student side, but should it showed up on the, the principal clinical educators screen.
So it may be something that we have to dig a little bit deeper into. So this other one for the clinical educator comments, this is showing up for you because on the template we have that question enabled.
And if we use a default comments during the student review,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/65a7f46fc46649d08359a27caf28d628</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU Questions/Issues - 12.05.2022 - Google Docs - 5 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mitch. I wanted to go into some of these issues. I pulled it all into one document for our team here so they can look into any of these.
So for this first one, for individuals that have multiple roles, we want to use the role that will automate the most processes in metrics.
So if you have evaluations going out to principal, clinical educator, and you have other things getting automatically assigned, you based it on that role, that should be their primary role.
And then any other roles they have can be created using groups. So you can create a group called Course Mentor and then this would allow the administrators to put individuals into that group and then use that group in different parts of the system.
This can be used to send out announcements too. For the custom user fields. We don&#39;t have a way to turn off these standard fields at this time.
I&#39;m gonna be suggesting a feature to the team to hide, give, give administrators a way to hide some of these fields.
This is something that we&#39;ll try to get at down in the future. And for sorting the fields, it&#39;s showing up in that order because when our team created it, they were created in that order.
And it is possible for us to change the order on our end. It&#39;s not available on the interface for the end users such as yourself.
So when we do this new feature for site demographic fields, we&#39;re also adding a feature that allows administrators like you to drag and drop or move these, these fields and put them in a certain order.
So for now, and, and we&#39;ll see if we can move those on our end, but we&#39;ll be releasing that site demographic field before the students go live and hopefully by the end of January.
And at that point we&#39;ll be able to reorganize it easily, and then you&#39;ll be able to move them as, as you see fit.
I also wanna speak to you on Thursday about the licenses and see if we can, if we should consider the documents and certifications page as the best way to handle that, cuz it has expiration tracking built into it.
For this one, yes, we have to fix the formatting. So our team will be looking into that. I didn&#39;t understand this part.
Maybe this was covered in the bottom video. But if not, we can talk about it tomorrow. For this next one, yes, we do send emails and SMS if, if, if it is enabled, that allows the preceptors or clinical principal clinical educators to click on it and approve these without logging in.
So for this next video here, this notes field is something that if we disable this notes field, it will disable the additional details field at the end and also remove this comment field.
And let me know if that that would solve the problem or if we need to do something else. So for this particular issue of the clinical educator comment, we have identified an issue where a custom case demographic field, there&#39;s two ways to display them in the system.
One is showing it to the trainee when they&#39;re logging the case. And the other one is having that question appear when a preceptor or principal clinical educator is reviewing the submitted case.
So the issue that we identified is that if it&#39;s a com and that&#39;s enabled for only the principal clinical educator, it&#39;s also being shown on the student side, on your server.
So we&#39;re gonna be sending that to the team to address. However, in this particular scenario, we recommend removing this completely and using the default comments section.
So under the performance section, there is a faculty comments field that&#39;s built in that&#39;s part of the system that you can use to capture this comments.
So hopefully once this is removed, it&#39;ll remove that from the student side and the faculty or principal al educators will still have this comments.
And this also will appear on the students portal in a special place so that they can hover over this and see what the comments were.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/33ac7cc1c823481ab607a968a08c07a7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Lathan. I&#39;ve been working with the team at Michigan State on this new module and essentially it&#39;s gonna allow students to request elective rotation.
And this is a testing count with a test student. You can see here that I have a rotation that I&#39;ve been scheduled to, and this could be a placeholder entry for an elective.
And the student can come in here and they can say which hospital, they&#39;re gonna do an elective, and then they can, if this, if the elective does not, site does not exist, they can submit the site information.
They can choose an existing rotation, they can choose a specialty. Choose an administrator. If they don&#39;t have one, they can type in the information and then go back and submit all this with an attachment and the administrators can approve it and then update the schedule to this site that they requested.
I was wondering if something like this is currently being handled and under what the current process is, cuz this is something that is currently in development.
What I&#39;m showing you is not released yet. And if this can be useful for you and if there&#39;s any you know, slight modifications that are needed that can help your team we would certainly consider that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9099c4168c1742119193bfc5cb832625</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leads | Medtrics Lab - Real | Close - 2 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi David. So these are the three smart views that I created in here. So this one is client missing data and it&#39;s for any organization with the organization type is not present.
Contract start date, current contract. The url, the Confluence page, which will probably have to take out for now current invoice.
And and, and this only applies for all current clients, so we can see there&#39;s a bunch of items here that we need to fix up for missing renewal dates.
You can see that all of these are missing them. And then renewal this quarter shows any, any leads that are for renewal days of this quarter.
I didn&#39;t put the client filter here in case something got mis characterized or mis categorized, figured it keep it simple.
So if something falls into this time period, it will appear here. And what I&#39;m hoping is we can use a smart view to trigger a task creation in Jira.
And what I wanna do is create a new project and I can set that up for you. That&#39;s gonna resemble the growth ops project, or in the onboard project it&#39;s gonna be called Success.
And in success we&#39;ll have each client as an epic. And then within each client, when you expand it, we wanna show any tasks that we need to do along with the quarterly check-ins.
So these tasks from close, it would be ideal if it gets created under the appropriate client, but if that&#39;s not possible, it&#39;s fine for us to create it as as a just regular stories and have it assigned to Ken since he&#39;s gonna be the one that&#39;s managing it.
So hopefully that is possible. It&#39;s, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for us to have it for all of these as long as we have it being created for renewals this quarter.
And then missing renewal date. Those two are really the the two most important ones. And then there&#39;s a few other things that I was thinking about.
Another automation using Zap here that we can do is when someone replies to a campaign in re in reply, having a lead and contact and an opportunity created in close.
And I think it&#39;s okay to create it for all replies. If it&#39;s not possible to filter out the one that&#39;s positive it&#39;s then we can just clean it up and remove the opportunity if we need to.
So that&#39;s something that will help mark so that that doesn&#39;t have to be manually done. So those are the two things that I can think of right now.
Let&#39;s see how that goes. And I, there are, you know, other things that we can automate but I would love to you to try to take a look that, look at that and see what we can do.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/90b796d25bcf457fb27b0111430688d2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Persad. Hi Persad. So this report is amazing. Thank you for the changes you made here. It&#39;s a couple of things that I was misunderstood for the client.
So we, we need to make a couple more tweaks and join the previous task with this. So first thing is we have to add a column called enrolled with a checkbox here.
And this enrolled checkbox, we&#39;re gonna be using this bull field that&#39;s on the user schedule called Reviewed. So we added this feature a little while ago, and it&#39;s, we actually added it incorrectly.
It should have been called Mark as Enrolled. So on the back end, we wanna change this field to enrolled enrollment status, enrollment under status, and then checkbox here, renamed this two mark is enrolled.
And on this page it&#39;s going to be renamed to 263, not sorry pending enrollment and then zero enrolled. And this red box here with the R in it, we&#39;re gonna rename that to n r, sorry, n e to, for representing, not enrolled.
Actually let&#39;s keep it consistent. We can call it PE to pending enrollment. And then we&#39;ll have a, a green box here that says E for enrolled.
And anywhere that if it&#39;s already enrolled and the checkbox is turned on, we&#39;re gonna show the green box. Same thing on this schedule here.
It shows you pending. We&#39;re gonna show pending enrollment on this list view. And the other modification that we have to do is this whole enrollment checkbox.
And these, this these changes, like all of the things that we just talked about on this block schedule should only appear if this program is a U Me program.
We don&#39;t wanna show pending Enrollment or the little green or red box or the check box if this is a GME program, only if it&#39;s me and then not sure why this page for some reason is so slow.
And then we&#39;re gonna add this a column called enrollment and with a checkbox. And what we&#39;re going to do is show the same checkbox that&#39;s on the user schedule model, and it&#39;ll only appear if this is a an edit or a addition.
So if it&#39;s a deletion or if it&#39;s a deleted record we&#39;re not gonna have anything to show. But otherwise it&#39;s gonna pull from the the the, the linked user schedule and it&#39;s gonna show that status here.
So if someone wants to uncheck that, they can do that here or on the block schedule. And, and this checkbox for enrollment will be managed from both places.
So hopefully that makes sense. And what we&#39;re trying to do is give them a one place where we can charge a start char practice enrollment in a list view.
So this page will make it easier for them to manage that without having to open up a whole bunch of schedules.
Let me know if you have questions. I can answer that in the tomorrow.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3656e20ab28a49fa92fae66ecc043fbe</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Persad. So for this particular task we have this audited checkbox here. I believe we added this to the, as a backend field for the logs user schedule logs.
One more tweak that we need to do on this report that we missed due to misunderstanding is on, like, we need to add a check box for this.
Let me try to pull it up first before I talk. So on the user schedule record itself, we have a status called r Mark.
Reviewed these, these, these check boxes. What we wanna do is, if I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s taking so long here, what we wanna do is essentially cha rename this field both in the back end and the front end to review markets reviewed, sorry, markets enrolled.
And On this page it can be defaulted as NR for not enrolled. And then 249 not enrolled, and zero enrolled.
So we&#39;re changing the backend name, the on the modal, and on this page is gonna be not enrolled 249, and then a green E at the, at this box like this in green with the E to represent enrolled.
So this is something that already is there. All we&#39;re doing is renaming it and updating the interface to say NR and with, and if it&#39;s not enrolled.
And then e with a red, I mean a orange, what am I saying? Green box if it&#39;s enrolled.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/36438b4c46bd45fab9b57447fb2fc968</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of December 4, 2022 - 6 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, mark. Wanted to get your opinion on something that was considering. So, mark, Liz, and Lay. They are trained by their company to give really good updates at the start of the day and at the end of the day.
So they usually start out by saying what they&#39;re planning on doing and then share summary at the end of the day.
And we&#39;ve been kind of having them send that to us where we&#39;ve been working with them. I was thinking about starting a dedicated channel where they can post this.
And then we also use the same channel for the developers as they start their day and end of, end their day, sort of like a, a high buy channel and, or, you know, it is a standup, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s a, I don&#39;t want to take away from the existing in-person standup.
This is the re the thing that, the value that I see from having a channel for this is helping each person get into the habit of planning out their day.
And sometimes what I feel like happening for the huddle is we&#39;re all getting into the meeting without taking a few minutes to think about what you have on your plate for the day.
And what I was thinking is we start this channel, have mark and lay join that channel and they can start posting updates.
The developers can post updates maybe a couple of months of them using this channel. We can ask our current team if they can also do something similar.
Maybe put out bullet points in there of what they have planned for the day. And at the end of the end of their shift put a summary at, at the, at the end of what they have accomplished.
And this way hopefully the huddle will get shorter and we can focus on anything that requires discussion rather than going into everything.
And I also wanna try to get, get to the, get to a point where everybody is bringing something that they need to discuss to the huddle, rather than all of us simply hopping on and one person leading and asking questions.
So anyway, let me, let me know your thoughts from a project product, project management perspective, and then we can try to work on something.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/411cc08525d94610bb9b3aba7e41abf2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi ship. These changes are really great and I shared this with the client and they&#39;re very happy with everything that we&#39;re doing.
I want to add some feedback as you&#39;re working through this on this page here. One of the things that the client mentioned today was if we could we wanna hide this button, if the rotation is going to be starting within the next 30 days, or if the rotation has already passed.
So, for example, this is tone from 2021. We would not show this since it&#39;s, there&#39;s no way that they should be able to change a request for something that has happened in the past.
And they also don&#39;t want the button to show if it&#39;s 30 days or less. Between, from now to the start date in the future, maybe we&#39;ll add a setting that allows the client to control how many days into the future they wanna allow change requests, but for now we can just hard code it for 30 days.
Then once we get into this, the Okay, yes, I&#39;m trying to find something here. I think instead of using, again, this is something that we don&#39;t have to modify in this task if if it&#39;s too difficult.
Actually we, we do need to, this is cause they&#39;re gonna have a lot of sites. And what we wanna do is use View Tree Select so they can search for it and select a, select a site.
So you know this, this is the out when you, on the under system setup outbound we, this is sort of a similar workflow where we can set certain things and then press continue and it goes to the another section and it ca it goes through this whole process.
So similar to this, we would want to use view Tree select for some of these dropdowns, so it&#39;s searchable and let&#39;s say if I choose one of what&#39;s next, and here, I think it&#39;s better if we show it in some, some a card like this with this information in here.
So instead of the header, we can say site, site name in the header, and then the address in this white area.
I could not select. I could not, and if I select this, we would, let&#39;s show this above this. I could not find site enlist above.
So because this goes with this and we want this to be below that. And let&#39;s say if I choose this and, and we would wanna also show the full site address that&#39;s from the site profile.
And if I&#39;m typing it in, I don&#39;t need to show that here. So if I choose one, it&#39;ll show under it the full address.
If I&#39;m typing it in, I don&#39;t need to show that here. We would want to make this a required field, so they have to choose one of these two before they can click continue.
And then if I choose existing rotation, the E and the R doesn&#39;t need to be capitalized and choose that. And then I can, they should be a required field.
They should be able, they should have to choose one of these two options. And if I choose this, then I&#39;ll have to type something in.
And I think we can also add a little text above that says please enter rotation name and then they can type it in.
And here if I choose one then we&#39;re gonna call this header rotation administrators slash supervisors. And then it&#39;s gonna show the rotation administration supervisors inside this like this.
And then for specialty so that should be a required field. This rotation administrator should be a required field. And then if they chose a site up here, this should only show users with home institution that is matches the site that was selected here.
And they do this, they can type everything in. So everything up to here should be required when they get to this rotation supervisor.
This information doesn&#39;t have to be required. We can, we, we would, we can also add a third option here that says, I do not have this information at this time, and they&#39;re just gonna use that to skip it.
So it will be required field, I guess, but you can either choose rotation supervisor, enter this information or choose, I did not have this information at this time.
And then that&#39;s just basically a way to skip, skip through this and then click next, and then the rotation start date and the rotation end date and the attachment field should be required.
And then Submit maybe something missing here. All right, so, awesome. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s pretty much the feedback we had from the meeting today.
I&#39;ll send this to you in a video. Let me know if you have any questions and once we have the admin side, I&#39;ll test that also.
And then we should be able to get them in here to test it out. Awesome. Work on this.

So if I go, so we are a new, newer medical school in Michigan. Yeah. And our go to research, our research is here.
And so research activities, and these are the pages I take care of. So the student research activities, I have to do this by manual.
I do this all by payments. Oh wow. Okay. And so I count how many peer reviewed articles they had, how many book chapters, how many authors there worked, what were their papers, what were their names and so yeah.
Where did the articles go? So this is all manual. This is not what I like, would love to do. Yeah.
But This is what needs to be done. Yeah. And I get That. So I often joke as job security cuz no one else wants to do it.
&lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I do all of this and at the end of the month I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going to I have a lot more.
Yeah. Like I have to do the other classes. Like right now I only have four here. Yeah. Excuse me. And so that&#39;s all manual and then that&#39;s too far.
That&#39;s reported here. It&#39;s reported back to the various stakeholders. Okay. Whatnot. Now for the departments, I do all of this &lt;laugh&gt;, I count all This up.
We do it by fiscal year. I&#39;m just gonna take I&#39;m gonna just take the department of biomedical sciences. We tell people how much we publish and their research activities, other, why is that not showing up?
Yeah. Is that good? Hold on. There might be an error in the coating. Let me just see what&#39;s going on here.
Oh, we, these all show up underneath, but they may have made a change to that. So the pages weren&#39;t that long.
Okay.  Yeah, it sounds like they did, they just tightened it up. So How did they report this to you? So, how it gets reported, let me show you.
Go to faculty information system. So the faculty information system under administration what we do, oh, shoot. Lemme put the, with this so you can see it.
So this is, this is ra. Yeah. Now I wanna tell you our, I, our, our RA doesn&#39;t look like anybody else&#39;s.
Yeah. Cause the previous administration and previous leaders that were here did so many changes to it. Yeah. And they&#39;ve corrupted a lot of things.
Okay. And I&#39;m one of the few people left. And so You&#39;re holding down the Fort &lt;laugh&gt;. So, I mean, there&#39;s new people and I like, we&#39;re, we&#39;re hiring for new I for faculty faculty affairs.
And I&#39;m just like, as soon as I get that person on board, I think we&#39;ll be able to discuss like, does it need to look like this?
Do we need a new system? I don&#39;t know. Yeah.  But is this something that is mainly used for keeping all the information for the faculty organized?
Yeah. Okay. So What I do is what I&#39;ll do, I&#39;ll actually do myself. So this is me. I&#39;m in, I&#39;m faculty in the department of the library.
Yeah. This is Oh, oh, that&#39;s not what I want. Sorry. Faculty search. I am my wrong ate. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not gonna correct it.
Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;. No, it&#39;s alright. So this is my whole record right here. And then what we do here is under the scope is Author search.
Yep. You can see I can put my name in. And I, we have a subscription to Scope is. Yeah. So what we do, I&#39;m just gonna put my number in.
My scope is author their id Yep. Hit the search. And it would, so you can see it&#39;s not working as well as it should be.
Yep, Yep.  But it would find me And then you can kind, And then I can click it on and bring it over.
Yeah. So each, each of the faculty members essentially can search for it and then say I did this. Yeah. Okay.
And, and bring everything over. And so you would see all of this. I see the details take you there. The details will take you to the SCOs page.
So this is my SCOs page. Yeah. And so this is where it&#39;s linking from. Okay. It&#39;s not linking from the orchid, it&#39;s just linking from the SCOs id.
Okay. Now the only negative thing is SCO will, if you have more than one SCO record and you merge them, you will get sometimes a new, new author ID and so that I have to rebuild them.
Okay. But faculty can let me know that. There, so let me just show you what my faculty profile looks like.
Hold on. So you can see, so if we were to go to, I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll go to one of the biomedical sciences Yeah.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bcaeb7c4850445f6b0a4d279ef03b99a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Profile Settings | Medtrics Lab - Real | Close - 7 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ken.

And once you get in here, go into, um, connected accounts and add account and put your, um, your account in here so that the emails that were sent to the clients will get synced in here and we can look up any conversations and pick, pick it up from there.

So this new feature that we build, it&#39;s getting loaded into a testing environment and we also loaded your MSU database onto it.
This way you can test it using your data. One thing that I wanna emphasize is whenever you&#39;re testing, always be careful which server you&#39;re on.
So once ideally it&#39;s good to test on a browser that you don&#39;t use for work, so you don&#39;t accidentally use the wrong system for making changes, cuz it&#39;ll look exactly the same.
The only difference is going to be the URL&#39;s gonna be different. So this is a temporary server with your data the backup data from your production environment that you&#39;re using for testing.
And you wanna make sure that you&#39;re only using it for testing. So this new feature here&#39;s how it works. Under system setup, rotations will have a list of all the rotations that you have for msu.
And then if I go in here, I will go ahead and pick a unique rotation. She will create a new one, call it testing, and we have this check box we can turn on.
It says allow trainee to swap rotation assignment. And then if that&#39;s turned on when someone is scheduled to this rotation, they&#39;ll have the option to request a change.
And we can turn that on for more rotations that we need to before testing. We&#39;ll use it for this one Location.
Let me save that. And this testing server is also a little slower than our production. So please be patient with it and go to, once we have that set up, I&#39;m gonna go to schedules and I&#39;ll just pick this first one.
And I&#39;m going to enable this rotation. I mean, enable the site that we chose to com all sites save that.
Otherwise we won&#39;t be able to select that rotation. And then one more thing that I wanna do is, you know, just set this up.
We have a test student here, test@metricslab.com. I&#39;m gonna edit this user&#39;s password to test msu. Save that. Okay, OMS three, let&#39;s go back to the schedules.
And for this first schedule for St. Joseph include this user so that we can schedule this user. All right, this was all set up work.
That&#39;s already done. So what I&#39;m gonna do now is going to pull up test student and then going somewhere into the future and put this student on this new feature, new rotation called testing feature ad.
I&#39;ll also do it in the past testing. Yes. Then I&#39;ll publish it. And now I&#39;m gonna log out, log in as student, Go to schedules.
And now you can see that I have this new rotation I was scheduled to. And then I can request a change and go through the process of requesting the change.
Okay. And then once it is submitted, go back into the admin side and take a look to see what that, what that Shows up as.
So please take a look at the student side, the admin side, and let me know what feedback you have and if you run across any issues as you go through this please let us know.
This is again, a testing environment. And it&#39;s you can do whatever you want on here. It&#39;s not gonna impact your production as long as you&#39;re being careful with the URL and confirm that you&#39;re using the testing server.
And also please don&#39;t share this with anyone else cuz we don&#39;t want any of the other users to be logging into the testing environment and, and, and thinking that it&#39;s production cuz it looks identical.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6f7d53f390bd40e59d026195474b2038</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Schedule - List - 22 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>First of all, this thing is amazing. I&#39;m really impressed and I can, we have to pretty much work on incorporating this into the system and start replacing some of our existing scheduling using this.
So before we do that, we should polish it up and make some tweaks to, to mostly just minor tweaks to make it more tailored to different types of users.
First thing, I&#39;m not sure if this, these buttons at the top is showing up for, because I&#39;m logging a super admin.
If not, then we would wanna hide that. The other thing is I believe we can get rid of, not get rid of, but by default we can use it for rotations and shifts.
And then for cuz that&#39;s what this is mainly gonna be used for. And Sessions will want to they&#39;ll need to have more context and maybe in the future we can do so that if there is a e client we turn on sessions and events by default, if a GME client, we would turn on rotations and shifts by default.
But for now, I think what the best is to turn these two on. And then the events, it can be actually maybe instead of making this a dropdown, since there&#39;s only five of them, what if we make them into like these kind of toggle buttons so we can turn &#39;em on and off quickly if we want to and color code it so that it matches the color code here.
So if I&#39;m clicking on events, then all of the events will be same type and instead of using a dropdown, you&#39;ll have all of them visible up here.
And then usually for UX from a UX perspective, if it&#39;s five or less, it&#39;s better to have it visible and you can turn it on and off without having to go into a dropdown.
And then if we use a color code, that would also make it easier for them to visually see what&#39;s What should be added or removed.
Then the other tweak here is we would only want to show the users that are active by default and then almost all of them we want this show the role next to it.
And because that matters when you&#39;re looking at a schedule. So if it&#39;s a PGY three, PGY two a lot of times they would also wanna know contact information cuz from mi on, one of the main things that we use it for is to look at the phone number and email address.
I mean phone number on pager numbers for that individual. But that&#39;s, that&#39;s something that we may, if it&#39;s difficult to add, we can a can handle it later.
But the role is definitely important. I think ideally if I&#39;m coming here if I can have a way to hover over or click on and see a profile information in a popup, Let See if I can find a, yeah, so this was something that mocked up at some point where if I&#39;m looking at something, then I can sort of see the contact information and then reach out to them.
You can see here that&#39;s, that&#39;s addition to having the schedules in reference in Amon. The contact information is the most valuable thing besides who&#39;s like, if you&#39;re, you&#39;re looking at it for your own sake, but you&#39;re also looking at it to find out who you need to contact for a certain service.
Alright, so that&#39;s that. And then for this view, so if I click on it, wow, this is amazing. So if I click on it, then it&#39;s showing this individual schedule.
It would be nice if there was a way for me to go back to the full view from this easily.
Like if I click on something, having a button to go back to the timeline view and then having a way to look up contact information from here also.
And will likely have to put some sort of, we&#39;ll have to be selective on what programs show here. Cuz for example, it&#39;s showing certain programs like import kpnc what we can probably do is on the at some point on the schedule itself, let them decide if they want all the schedules to be displayed in this, in this view or if it&#39;s something that they want, we wanna skip.
So maybe on a program setting we can specify if the schedule&#39;s from that program is gonna be included or not.
And then, or we can filter out by at least for now, filter out programs with at least one block schedule and a one shift schedule.
So that&#39;s not showing a bunch of them that don&#39;t have any. Anyway, that&#39;s minor. Trying to think through this as I see it.
The other thing is, I, I do, I do think that it&#39;s, it&#39;s good to eh, I was thinking that maybe it would be better for the timeline view to be default, but I think this, this is fine.
Maybe what we can do is put this button in the middle as like a bolt, have both of them visible timeline and list view, one selected and one unselect.
It&#39;s almost like tabs cuz I feel like some people may not think to go click on this button at the top right and they&#39;re missing a very powerful view.
But if you put it right in front of them and have it so that one is selected and then they&#39;re gonna be curious to see what the other one is and they, they&#39;ll click on it either in the middle or the left somewhere prominent so that it&#39;s not all in the top corner.
Cuz it&#39;s a super important that they know that this exists immediately. So I think in here for example yeah, so I put this this kind of like this block calendar view, block view sort of like this so that it&#39;s right in the middle.
So so&#39;s some variation of that. The other thing we&#39;re gonna have to incorporate here is the site information for where something is gonna take place.
Well those are my quick immediate thoughts. We can, this is, this is amazing. So I think these are all minor stuff we can tweak up and then I&#39;m gonna start thinking about how we&#39;re gonna, where we wanna put this in the system.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d48cbca444044061bdac43c936823e3e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, so couple of minor things that we wanna address. First is when the, when we have no details to show for site, let&#39;s show a text in italics that says no additional details available for if there&#39;s no rotation, supervis, there&#39;s an administrator specified.
We can say none specified. And then the other thing is, as you click next and continue and keep going to the next step, we wanna disable any of the previous selections.
So here&#39;s what I mean. If I click here, I choose a site, click next. Now I can choose a rotation, but if, but I can go back and change this, but it doesn&#39;t make any changes here.
So what we wanna do is if I go click next, the previous area becomes great out so that you can change it maybe we can add a back button so that they can go back one step.
If that&#39;s easy to do, it&#39;s not a big deal. They can always cancel and come back. But the main thing is we don&#39;t want them to go in here and select a different site and the data to be incorrect.
So as I click next, the previous steps becomes disabled. Another thing is right now, if I can submit a request and then submit another request for the same rotation.
So since we don&#39;t have a way for them to, for them to see what was already submitted, let&#39;s once a request is submitted, we can just show a great out button here that said request submit Swap change request submitted, and it&#39;ll be a great out button that, that you can&#39;t do anything with.
So it, that way they&#39;re not allowed to submit more than once for the same rotation. And if they need to, if they need to make any changes, they&#39;ll have to email the school.
So this way it doesn&#39;t create duplicates. So those are the tweaks that came from the meeting. And then from the admin side, I haven&#39;t really haven&#39;t tested the the assignment part.
I&#39;ll take a look at that and see if there&#39;s anything we need to do there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/44f6095e457349c1b854133651499c87</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 6 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, uh, Mike. So for the first item that you&#39;re mentioning there, um, for the global setting, if you go into program admin portal and then go to settings, um, there is a setting in here called, uh, For case logs here.
So reminding students to log cases x days before, this is the same setting that we have on the rotations page.
But if I turn this on, essentially I&#39;m turning it on for every single rotation. So I can either turn it on globally for everything, or I can uncheck this and then go to the other page and add it specifically for each rotation.
So what I was saying was, if I turned this on, then we wanna use whatever information is here. And this is something that you wanna include in this specs.
There&#39;s no design change for the other thing that I was mentioning for shifts. Um, if I click on this, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s no shifts here, but if I go in here and say, I want this to be ad rule, um, so actually we can call it instead of add, instead of X number of shifts, we can say X rules.
And what it&#39;s saying is that every time someone is scheduled to diagnostic medicine, also put them in the Wednesday shift.
Um, so this is an automation tool that we have, but most people don&#39;t know about it because we don&#39;t show it anywhere else.
So on that design you have, you can say if there is a rule that&#39;s added, you can put account and say X rules.
Um, and uh, if it doesn&#39;t have anything, you can just leave it blank.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/83d114b39314489c89499e8dea2202b2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Intercom - 6 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this is a bug that&#39;s coming in from msu. Um, we have set up their email template, attending evaluation of clerkship re, uh, clerkship student to go out, um, to actually have a email notification that goes out seven days before the end of the rotation reminding the student to complete an evaluation.
So this is turned on for seven days and what the client is reporting. And she, uh, shared, um, some emails.
So you can see that the student, uh, received an email reminding them to do this on the 19th, which looks like the correct email.
And then again, on the 26th, they got another email, um, to request an evaluation. So, um, trying to see, confirm that this was sent from our server.
So we have one email and then another email on the 26th that went out. And we&#39;re trying to figure out why this student got a second email when this reminder is only set up for, uh, seven days before the end of the, uh, rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4cce84c407764e0b91e6af47707c0436</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, ship. So couple of things that I&#39;ve noticed. One minor thing is this  This on this model, when a site is selected or any record is selected and there&#39;s nothing to show, we can have a little message in here that says no details available and italics.
So in plain text, no details available, so it doesn&#39;t look blank. No additional details available. And then the other thing here is when you select a site or something and you click next, we would wanna we would want to disable the options above because otherwise I can do this.
I can select something, then I can go back and select something else. And this rotation doesn&#39;t match up with the, that site.
So I think what we can do is disable anything above so that it doesn&#39;t create a discrepant. So this applies for as we go further down.
Nice. And there&#39;s a small alignment issue here. We can add a little padding here and then make this full width up to the, so it aligns with the rest of the fields.
And they also had some comments about some custom text descriptive texts they wanted to include. I&#39;m gonna hold off on until they tested to write that out.
But for now we can just focus on the, these tweaks. So the main thing is adding any, adding a thing that says no additional details available if there&#39;s nothing to show.
And then for rotation, administrator and supervisor we can just say none specified since we&#39;re saying that no individuals, no users are specified.
So we can say none specified.

So under institutional portal system set up customized, we have something called document types.
Here we can add different categories of documents that we want to store in the system for this school or organization or, and when we&#39;re on this page, we can filter this page by active document types and whether it&#39;s administrative only or it&#39;s available for all users.
So to create a new one, we click new, and then we can define whether it&#39;s only available for administrators or available to all users.
And on this page you can see that some of these are, we can delete some, we cannot. If a document category has been used with files and we have stored some files, it can only be deactivated.
It cannot be deleted. So now that we looked at how to create them, let&#39;s take a look at how we use them throughout the system.
There are two major categories of document types and metrics, and those are institutional documents and personal documents. Institutional documents have two types within it, I mean two groups of documents within it.
There&#39;s the site document and there&#39;s program document sites are are supposed to be organizations or hospitals or, or universities. They&#39;re supposed to be institutions that the, this client is affiliated with.
Program is meant to be specific training programs within a site. So on the institutional portal we have sites and we have programs and we open up one of these sites.
We can attach documents to a site. So a metrics hospital here has documents and metrics. And those documents can have expiration dates and we can see that this was categorized as affiliation agreement.
And we do have the ability to track expiration dates for these documents. And then metrics can email them. Reminders when these documents that are expiring, we&#39;ll cover that in a separate topic, but in this article we can mention that there are exploration tracking for these documents.
Then under programs we have documents that are attached to programs and they are also active and inactive documents there. So those are the two types of institutional documents.
And then for personal documents, if we open up a user and go to the documents and certifications tab, you can click upload document, and then we can select the category that the document belongs to.
So these are the document types that we created. And if, since I&#39;m logged in as an administrator, I&#39;m, I&#39;m able to select any of the categories, any of the user, I mean a document types.
If I were to log in as this user Cole, I would only see the document types that are available for all users.
I would not see the admin, user admin, user admin document types. So we have institutional documents, which are two two groups, which is program and site.
And then we have personal documents which are attached to the individual user. Personal documents also have expiration tracking and we can email them about these.
And then under documents and manage documents here, we are able to see all documents that are linked to the site and program under institutional documents.
And then under personal documents, we can see all documents that are linked to individual users. Since I&#39;m in the institutional portal, I have access to both of these tabs and I can, this is a basically a centralized way to manage all these documents.
If I added something to the site or doc or or program, they would appear here. I also have the ability to upload them directly from this page.
For personal, this is showing every user in the system that has a document and the status of those. If I expand one of these, I can upload the document here on the program admin portal.
We also have a managed documents page, but you can see that it only shows the documents for the individual users.
It doesn&#39;t show institutional users institutional documents. Since this is a personal document, S S.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/03026b22aadc415db39bd3e4bbb7fca0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Reschedule Confirmed - Calendly - 5 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>&lt;affirmative&gt;. Hey David. So going through this, um, one comment here, let&#39;s see if we can reword this in a way with that, it doesn&#39;t include a specific person&#39;s name, cuz the person that is we&#39;re talking to may not be the decision maker and it&#39;s, uh, this probably gonna get passed around by, um, multiple people.
So it&#39;s best to keep it as a more of an organizational, uh, request. And then prepared by, if you could, uh, put your title in there and if you can include your contact information, phone number, and email.
So in case someone needs to reach out to you after they receive an email. Pat this, this is good. Um, I&#39;ll comment on the, um, any content related thing or tweaks after I read through it again.
So, for example, um, we don&#39;t want to say ACGME requirements here for, for, um, e I would reword this, reword it in a generic way, try quality activities for trainees, in fact, um, for faculty, um, and trainees.
And then leave it at that. Um, is there a way to remove exclusions from here to simplify this? Cause it doesn&#39;t add any, um, value and it&#39;d be easier if we can simplify.
Um, and what I would rather like if they look at, No, I, sorry, I, I was confused about the way that we have it.
Um, so the curriculum management, uh, component, we, we would still be charging the full, this curriculum delivery is more of the student component of that.
And this administrative side, we still want to charge the full rate, um, the chart generation and the msp, this is fine.
So we don&#39;t wanna discount this out. And uh, yep, this is perfect.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4767489193924c5085846b48ba420b20</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>FAQ Content Planner - Google Sheets - 18 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Liz. Thank you for this great article. It looks good. Couple minor comments here is we could use the crop tool to crop out the this scroll ball, scroll bar on the right side.
And we also want to inform the client how these u fields are used in the system. So I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the best way to do this.
So it probably having a, a section at the top that shows how these user demographic fields appear in the user&#39;s profile under the additional info section based on the user type.
So if they create a field for faculty, then it only shows for faculty, if it&#39;s for residents, it only shows for residents.
And then that&#39;s how they can enter the be, Actually it&#39;s probably best to put it at the bottom. So once you create the field, we can show them how it can be used.
So on the edit demographics page of a user, it&#39;ll show up on the additional info. And once the user has created the data, it shows up on the user&#39;s profile at the bottom.
So I can go here and see all the data that I entered and if I want to edit it, I have to go to the edit profile or edit demographics and go to the additional info.
And the the last thing is reporting. We can just mention, we don&#39;t need to go into details cause we&#39;ll cover reports separately.
We can mention that these demographic fields can be pulled into reports on the user demographics report. And, and by going to the additional info section and they can select the fields they wanna export.
So all we need to do is say that reporting on this can be done from the demographics report called demographics profile information report.
And on this report they can select and export data that was entered to these custom fields.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/118eee77955a45e0bf39634c1679c4aa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So this is gonna be a bug that&#39;s impacting personal portals. If I go to a system, set up permissions for MSU server, you can load the MSU db and I look at this user called Michelle Benton Edit.
And if I scroll down here we have the manage evaluations for sites and all sites. And if I have that turned on, I should be able to view evaluations for all sites and complete evaluations for all sites on behalf of someone.
This bug only happens if you, this checkbox is used. If we turn on specific sites, it works fine. So maybe wanna check that that code to see if that can be helpful in troubleshooting this.
So if I turn this on, I&#39;m gonna go into users and login as Michelle, and then go to assignments and try to view an evaluation.
Nothing happens if I go to inspect console. I&#39;m getting an error here. Same thing if I try to click on full form, I&#39;m getting a permission error here.
So we need to address this bug so that if someone is selecting all sites, it works properly. Let me just also check the download, The download seat seems to be working fine.
So it looks like it&#39;s viewing and completing on behalf of someone.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/906f95ee7b734d4ab64126a3ce1553a3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 3 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Your organization for business process process development? Uh, we have a variety of different clients and people using metrics for different use cases.
Uh, so we do like to be, um, hands on with helping implement the software, um, to your business needs. Um, and our software is developed with the end user in mind with input from clinical physicians.
Tosh is a, also a full-time radiologist. Uh, so his input helps with that as well. Um, so we do have, um, a lot of different inputs in our approach to this development and our implementation.
This is kind of a, a rough visual visualization for how our implementation works. These things can happen in unison, uh, but generally we like to start with a discovery, um, to understand your business goals and processes a little bit better, um, the stakeholders involved with the organization.
And, uh, then once we actually start the implementation, we&#39;ll work with, uh, your organization to clean the data, get it into metrics, um, set it up test to make sure everything is configured correctly.
Um, and then we&#39;ll have training sessions, um, and consult for integrations and development. Um, and we have a variety of different clients using our software for different use cases, like I mentioned, from graduate medical education to undergraduate medical education, um, to nursing.
Um, so I, Sorry, Tasha, you can say something. Yeah. Before you get into the one, one thing that I wanna add, uh, is that when we say a business process development, it&#39;s essentially, um, how, how are you managing the students, uh, workflows from whether it be scheduling them or evaluating them and, and you know, when a, when an institution chooses a new software, uh, one of the things that we&#39;ve seen in the past is where the university is trying to re implement the same things that they were doing in the previous system and the new system, and it doesn&#39;t work well.
Um, and, and what we like to do is have that hands on, uh, um, discussions with over multiple weeks where we&#39;re looking at how you&#39;re currently doing things and how is the best way to implement the technology and u and build processes if necessary that utilize the most of the platform.
Because every system is not the same. And you&#39;re only gonna get the most out of a technology if your processes are built with that technology in mind.
And that means that, you know, if you&#39;re collect, and today we&#39;re gonna be focusing on the mspe because that&#39;s the main thing.
Uh, and you can implement that as a standalone with your data from other systems. But if there is, uh, different things that are happening for a clerkship or pre clerkship, uh, we really like to get idea of how things flow and then talk to what is the best way to set that up in a new software system.
So, so da David, I think, uh, you can continue there. Yep. Uh, so I have like a list of, uh, kind of questions here that, um, I&#39;d like to dive into to get a better understanding of your, your program and what you&#39;re interested in in metrics.
Uh, so could you tell me a little bit more about your background and your program and, uh, everything that you kind of manage agent program?
Okay. So, um, I&#39;m at the School of Medicine at George Washington University. And, um, what I do there is I&#39;m the administrative supervisor.
I also assist with the transition of our fourth year medical students, um, transitioning into residency. And so I&#39;m like, I&#39;m wearing mini hats there.
I do things with the budget, um, operations and things of that sort. Um, one of the main things that we really need, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just our medical school, I think this is just across the board with medical schools, is a better system that builds the MSPs.
Yeah. Um, we currently use the in-house system, which it works for us, but it doesn&#39;t mm-hmm. &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so there&#39;s a lot of, um, a lot of needs that we have as it relates to that.
And it requires interface from different, um, different sources. Like, um, for example, we also use Med Hub, which manages like our clerkships, our evaluations and things of that sort.
Um, immunization records. We use Med Hub to house, all of that. And, um, what the Ms p e without in-house Ms.
P system does it, it gets information from Med Hub and it syncs to our Ms P system. But sometimes there is a, there is a issue with data syncing correctly or rather appropriately to meet our needs.
Um, the system that we currently have, things are always changing. And so the person that built it, I don&#39;t know if the system just cannot accommodate the needs that we have, or if the workload of that individual is just too heavy for them to be able to provide us what we actually need.
So the way our Ms P system works is we have, I don&#39;t even know, like, I&#39;m not into like the data and like the Yeah.
Like all the terminology that, that, that goes with, with building like a system. But we, we filter out grades from our in-house registration system, not Banner, cuz we, we house grades and banner and we also house house grades in our in-house registration system.
And that is, that was built also by the person that built out MS. P system. So what it does is the grades that are in that system, it filters into the MS p, it sinks into the MSP system as well as, um, the courses like the clerkships.
So this, this software that you&#39;re using for in-house this, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s your sis or you&#39;re, you&#39;re setting that up in there as a, um, Or is Banner the main source of truth?
No, we get, it&#39;s from our in-house system. So we, we, we, the main source of truth is banner. Okay. Okay.
But Banner does not sync to our, in our MS P system. Okay. So you&#39;re pulling into this, um, in-house, uh, registration system from Banner and that system is syncing to this Ms, uh, solution.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fb69e3f339aa4e9eb51d679e1f3edd39</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Great work on this. Ship &#39;em. Looking through this and the couple of minor tweaks for here, for example, we&#39;re showing two you don&#39;t need to show the parenthesis.
You can just put IM Dash Internal Medicine. When we are clicking, instead of calling registration form, we can let&#39;s call it attachment instead of document attachment and then just have a download text here.
And we don&#39;t need the view and the edit button. We just need the view and the view button is gonna function the same way as the edit button, because they&#39;re not gonna be viewing just for the sake of viewing it.
They&#39;ll be viewing it to make a change to it. So we can just remove the edit button and have the option to update the rotation show up here.
And what they, what we need to do is for now, since we don&#39;t have an approved and reject, we&#39;re just going to have a save and close button.
And when they choose like these should be this should show the current rotation there by default. So currently this person is on family medicine with the start date and end date here.
What they&#39;re going to be doing is looking at the thing on the left, and they&#39;re going to be, actually, I take that back.
So what we wanna do is have this on the right side, filled out to the selected rotation with the starting end date.
If the selected rotation existed in the system, if it&#39;s a new rotation then we would just leave this as blank and they would look at what&#39;s here.
Go into the system, create that rotation, come back here, select what the new rotation, start date and end date, and then save it.
So essentially what this is gonna do is update the block schedule and replace this entry here with this new entry.
So there&#39;s, we&#39;re letting them swap that rotation from this page, and we can remove the approve and reject and instead put a save button and a close button.
So once they make the update here we&#39;re, they&#39;ll be able to use the save button The button to update the record.
And that&#39;ll show a confirmation. And there&#39;s a we can remove this from course catalog and just show specialty and decrease the size of this photo cuz it looks a little, I, I mean this, the text looks a little out of place.
This is very small and this is the photo&#39;s really big. So if we can make the photo a little smaller and then other tweaks we can other alignment tweaks and stuff, we can do.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1b8412b6c1044949827ea3b626dddc38</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>User Information Custom Fields.docx - Google Docs - 16 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Liz. So for this document what we need to do is go into the server and create custom user fields.
So I&#39;m gonna send you the login for this server. This is actually the client&#39;s production environment. We are still in setup mode, so I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s probably okay for us to do it there.
And then this way we don&#39;t have to do it twice. So if I go to user fields, here&#39;s where we can create custom fields.
And what we can do is clear out what whatever information is here, cuz we don&#39;t need it, and then start creating these fields in here.
And one of the things that you notice here is it says first name, middle name, last name. Those feels are already, you could click edit demographics.
You&#39;ll see that we have a bunch of fields here already and that&#39;s something that we don&#39;t have to recreate. Basically whenever you create these fields on the institutional portal.
And so if I, if I go to user fields and add a few of these fields, when I&#39;m creating a new user, they show up under the additional info.
So it&#39;s giving them additional fields that they can fill out. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re essentially doing when we&#39;re creating these custom fields.
So every user has some default fields that come with the system and they can add these additional fields to customize it for their organization.
And when we document this, what we wanted to do is show how to create it and, but also how it shows up on the demographics page.
And then it also shows up on the via profile. So it shows up under the additional info. And if I go to reports, there&#39;s also a demographic report that allows us to import, I mean, export using this.
So that part we can do documentation later. For the first step you can try creating this in the system and so should be able to do pretty much all of them.
You can skip this roles and groups for now and believe we have the home address and emergency contact I believe we have.
So you can check to see what, which of these fields we have and then try to select them. And for doctor information we can add three sections.
So they, right now they&#39;re saying school attended years of degree, graduation and degree. What we can do is they may have up to three schools they need to add.
So it&#39;ll be nine fields. Schools attended one years of graduation for one and for degree for the first one and then a second one,  For the all three fields for the second school.
All three fields for the third school. And let me know what questions you have. I&#39;m gonna also add you to the client onboarding channel so that you have a you&#39;re able to ask questions there.
And then the goal is for us to create these fields and then also write an article on how to do this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e32dac38b2894d11a17e263559127df2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 16 September 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Steve.

This is a email that I received from Lorraine, that program that We just demoed To a couple weeks ago.
And here you can see that she&#39;s saying their med help contract doesn&#39;t expire until 2024, and she&#39;s wondering if she should revisit this next year.
So this may be a common thing that you come across when you&#39;re calling or emailing, and I&#39;m responding to this by giving her advice on how to handle this.
So first, I, I generalize it. I say this is a common scenario that we run into. Here are a couple of questions to consider and I say, are the residency programs using Med Hub to manage cent manage the data centralized?
So what I&#39;m pointing at here is a lot of programs don&#39;t use Med Hub to its full potential and they&#39;re paying for it and they&#39;re using different software to manage their data, which if she&#39;s saying I have a contract until 2024, but they&#39;re not really using it and they have their data in multiple software systems, then it&#39;s better for them to transition to us and have everything centralized.
So I&#39;m pointing that out to her and so she can think about it and, but if everything is in Med Hub, then they&#39;re probably doing okay and it&#39;s okay to wait till next year.
So that&#39;s a question to ask them. Like, you know, if someone says we have a contract in place, it&#39;s asking them can you tell me about how are the programs using it?
Are they all using Med Med Hub or New Innovations to its full potential? Are they having the evaluations and schedules in there, or they, are they using multiple systems?
And if they&#39;re using multiple systems, then we can dig into it and saying, you know, isn&#39;t that causing problems with your data?
Like, are you not losing data in different, different platforms and if someone quits their job, how are you going to be able to train them if they&#39;re all using different systems?
So that&#39;s something that to mention. And then the second thing is she also in the last call mentioned they have new training programs starting up.
I don&#39;t remember if it was 2023 or 2024. That&#39;s another thing that they need to consider when they&#39;re switching platforms.
They don&#39;t want, they shouldn&#39;t have them on Med Hub for a year and then switch to us because it&#39;s going to make it harder for the program directors and coordinators to operate.
So it&#39;s better for them to switch to us now and have them centralized rather than keeping them on one system and then switch.
Then I&#39;m also mentioning here that budget is a concern, but we&#39;re looking for a long term relationship. If they have to keep both systems, like they have to keep the Med Hub contract and they wanna buy us, we can do our best to give them an discount for the first year so that they can make the, make the decision and move over to us.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c667fe769245453a98248771af25f2e4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Project Ops - Issue Types - Jira - 6 September 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Libby. So I was looking through &#39;em, um, some of the issues that we were adding to upcoming dev sprint, and I noticed that it was for a bunch of them.
We had forgotten to add the checkbox for, um, requiring dev work. Um, I went and corrected them over the weekend.
And what I&#39;m thinking is it would be better since we&#39;re mixing up dev tasks and non dev tasks. If we can have another story type, um, called feature.
So we have the regular story, or if you want to rename that to, uh, a, a business story or a feature story so that we can keep the feed, the dev task separate from, um, from a business task.
And this also makes it easier for, uh, the team, because we&#39;re already using a separate type for bug, and they&#39;re all used to having a feature type and a bug type from the way that we have done it in get lab.
So, and then with that workflow, it&#39;ll be easy. Uh, when you, when someone&#39;s creating a new item, they can simply go up here and choose feature or business story or bug.
And it&#39;s very easy for them to make sure that it&#39;s categorized correctly and don&#39;t have to remember to create it and then add the check box.
Um, yep. And then the other idea that I was thinking about was, uh, watching, um, one suggestion that, um, mark gave me today was, um, instead of using this task as a way to capture things, um, using a, a, um, label or some sort of tag to say, um, to indicate that it&#39;s an upcoming sprint, um, I think, uh, that&#39;d be good thing to do for the future and to continue using this for now, since it is working really well for, uh, Chris, David and myself, since it&#39;s all contained in one place.
Now, what I&#39;m planning on doing is once moved into get lab, I&#39;m going to remove it from this, uh, this, this task, so that, um, it&#39;s no longer a sub task after it&#39;s going to get lab.
Um, all right, cool. So I wanted to update you on those two things. If we can do that new feature of a new task type or story type, it&#39;ll be awesome.
I think it&#39;ll clear up, uh, um, the workflow issue and Yeah, let&#39;s, let&#39;s do one. I have a couple of other ideas, but I think let&#39;s, if we do one thing at a time and try it out to be better.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/45ac455da9ca49c58bbeb03c082000aa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (999) - 15 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mark. So I wanted to share this intercom issue as an example of some of the things. One, something that we have to figure out a way to solve.
And I&#39;ll let you think about it and see what&#39;s a good approach. And I&#39;ll give you some, a couple of ideas.
So this was a bug that happened I think a week, eight days ago where our case log report stopped working for students and I believe so we said they were gonna escalate this quickly and this was researched and put into a development task, and they went into the queue.
And it looks like, from what I&#39;m seeing here we didn&#39;t send any updates until they checked back four days later.
And it&#39;s then on Fri on Monday yesterday they check back to see what the status is And Monday we responded that it&#39;s pending rep deployment.
And then today they emailed a couple times asking what the status is. So I spoke to Ken about it and he mentioned that he doesn&#39;t know when deploys go out.
And since we don&#39;t have a notification like David Kapai used to post to the client support channel. So what I&#39;m thinking is we can have some form of alert that pops up automatically in Slack that reminds Marina to update the log and then another notification that comes in and just posts a link for the log.
And what I&#39;m thinking is also we do that on certain time. It doesn&#39;t have to be a direct integration from Confluence.
It can just be something that gets posted on Monday for Marina and then maybe Tuesday for everybody else. And if there is an issue with the deploy, then someone can respond and say, this didn&#39;t go out.
And then the other piece of this is something like this where we are trying to solve something that is a critical bug or something that&#39;s relatively sensitive, it would be helpful on those morning standups if the devs are providing like a percentage.
So if someone does ask, Hey, what is going on with that task? It&#39;s something that we can respond and say, you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s making progress.
It&#39;s halfway there. Because a lot of times the non-technical team members don&#39;t know how to gauge how big a task is, you know, is it something that&#39;s gonna be taking a day or it&#39;s gonna take two weeks?
So having a percentage for them, it&#39;ll be very helpful to make decisions on. And then a standup meeting that&#39;s happening in the morning, if they spit out a percentage and it&#39;s on that log then we can tell everybody to check the, the log if they have questions on a task that&#39;s in GitLab.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d78ba37b742d4fe09c8d49dbde5d44a5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 13 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So one of the things that we have to design for Mitch is site demographic fields. And if we go to the institutional portal system, set up user fields, we have the ability here to create fields for individual users.
So I can create a category, and then inside of the category, it can create a field name, such as, let&#39;s say, t-shirt size, and then what type of field it is, long text, short text, multiple choice or checklist that can assign it to the user type, and also define additional options here.
So what we wanna do is basically model this, and you do the same thing for sites. So first thing is to, we&#39;ll rename this to custom fields, and then we&#39;ll have a tab for user fields, another one for site fields, and it&#39;ll work exactly the same.
You have an active and inactive for site fields, and we can, they can create a category and create custom fields.
And then when they create that, instead of selecting user types, we&#39;ll have them select site type, and it&#39;ll be internal on external.
So they can create fields for internal, they can create for external, or they can use it for both. And once they&#39;re created, when a site is being set up At the bottom, we&#39;ll have each of the categories into an expandable accordion, just like we have on the evaluation rules assignments page.
So it&#39;ll show the category name, click on it, expand it, show the fields in there, and it&#39;ll allow them to enter the necessary information for the, those site demographic fields.
And then when you&#39;re actually viewing the site, we&#39;ll add those same fields to the top. So it&#39;ll have all of the site demographic information listed out.
And then if there&#39;s different categories, they&#39;ll, they&#39;ll be able to expand and collapse. You can figure out what is the best way for us to include all these demographic fields up here, assuming that they may have like 20 to 30 different fields.
So two sections. One is updating the setup of these custom fields, and then on the sites page, putting this on the page, and for when, when the site is being created.

And let&#39;s see if we can use this to improve it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/53efdf7946d1416498f137b44f589715</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Timezone Issue</pre></td><td><pre>Hey mark. So for the conversion, that&#39;s happening. If you look at the right side, this is the same entry that&#39;s on the screenshot from the metrics database for block 5, 5, 4 user one, uh, 9 1 8 1 9 1 8.
The ID here is obscure what we pulled it up from that. And you could see that for the start date.
It&#39;s 8 1 20 22 0 0 0 0. So midnight and the minus five is the, uh, time zone based on Utz. Um, so it&#39;s, it&#39;s midnight on Eastern time.
And then for the end date, it&#39;s 8 28 at 11 59 59. Again, at Eastern time with the five minus five, uh, UTC or GMT, um, that&#39;s how it is in metrics.
When it&#39;s converted in into a FileMaker, it&#39;s somehow adding the five hours, um, to the, uh, start data and the end date.
So it may be as simple as changing having a, um, a conversion where this is, everything is subtracted by five hours that would solve your problem.
Um, so you have the start date here. 8 1 20 22 at 5:00 AM instead of, uh, midnight. And then for the end date, it&#39;s going to 8 28, um, from 8 28 to 8 29 at, uh, 5:00 AM or 4 59 59, essentially it&#39;s adding five hours and that&#39;s why your end dates are going to the next day because midnight plus five hours is putting you into the next day.
But for the start date, it&#39;s not effected since, since, uh, midnight plus five hours is still in the same day.
So when it&#39;s a start date, so I believe you&#39;ll be able to solve this problem by subtracting five hours from the start and end date, um, are our dates are storing the, uh, UTC or Unix timestamp, uh, with the GMT at times zone.
And then the minus five is indicating from GMT, uh, times on how many hours to get to the server time, which is Eastern time.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/641ccfafc35a4e2bb9e3a4891bd66e51</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Integration Specifications - Google Docs - 8 November 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Marino. I wanted to get some feedback on this integration that we&#39;re helping msu plan out. So the way that it works is that they are using a software called Campus Solutions for Student Information.
So Campus Solutions is their main platform, I think it&#39;s from PeopleSoft and for all the student enrollment services. And Registrar Information and Metrics is being used to store the scheduling information.
So Campus Solutions has all the courses and all the sections of the courses and then class numbers that represent different timeframes that the students can take it.
So in metrics, we have those course codes. Let me see if I can pull up. MSU here are, So under grade book setup, we have the different course codes in here, and these course codes are mapped To the rotations.
See OSC 6 22. So this, this is the rotations and inside of each of these rotations, we have a map to grade book option to map it back to the grade book.
And then students are then put on the schedule using the block schedule. So what they&#39;re trying to do is they have section numbers and class numbers for each of the each course.
And we have to do an integration by which once a student is scheduled into a block schedule, we have to match it up with the class, the section number and class number for that course in campus solutions.
So what I&#39;m doing here is kind of explaining to them how they can do this. Select all student schedules that are created or modified in the last 24 hours.
Create this user schedule table for updated created less than 24 hours. Then for each schedule assignment, loop through it, Look up the course code, so the user&#39;s schedule is connected to the rotations.
The rotations is connected to the graded course rotation. And then this allows them to identify the course code that matches the campus solutions course code.
Then use a course code and the schedule start date. So the user schedule start date and end date to look up section numbers and class numbers.
So basically in campus solutions they have to say what the start date and end date is. And there&#39;s, there&#39;s gonna be a look up table in campus solutions for each course with the start date and end date matches.
They can retrieve the section numbers and class numbers. And we&#39;re going to be creating two fields on the user schedules table where they can store this section number and class number.
And we&#39;re gonna call that section ID and class ID if section exists in campus solutions with matching start and end date for the course.
Update metrics, user schedule, record with schedule section ID and class id. If it does not exist, continue to the next students schedule.
And then this is the first part of the integration. And then once they, the students are enrolled in the course, in campus solution, they&#39;re going to, we&#39;re going to look up the students in metrics and go through the same process of finding the user schedule.
Look this time, look using the existing section number and class number, and then turning on a flag, a bullion field that says the student is enrolled in campus solutions.
So first we&#39;re populating metrics with the section ID and class id, and then later after they&#39;re enrolled in campus solutions, we&#39;re updating a bullying field in metrics with the status of enrolled.
So one question that I had for you here is, first is this makes sense. And the second thing is, you know, looking up the course code and looking at up on the graded course rotation, instead of doing it as a lookup, does it make sense for us to have a direct link from the user schedule to the course code instead of going through the rotations or even populate the user schedule into a, with a course code as one of the fields so that there, this query does not need it.
I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the best approach when it comes to APIs and integration.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ef3c745f46154644ac739f18486f68fe</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 September 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So one quick note here, I realized something today, uh, based on an email that Emily Sentra MSU, when it comes to that reviews, um, we actually have another way that we can handle this problem.
Instead of taking that functionality away from the students, we could give them a way to filter those reviews out on the assignments page.
This is where they&#39;re having the problem where we only have reviewed, completed or pending review. What we can do is add a few more options here where it says review completed by evaluate tour review completed by evaluate T review completed by program administrator, and then pending review by evaluate T pending review by evaluate tour, and then pending review by program administrator.
Um, so those are the three types of people that can submit in or review. And what we&#39;re wanting to do is, um, give them an option to filter based on that.
So we could, we could, uh, have six options in there. Um, actually we can have eight. Well, what we can keep what we have, it&#39;ll be any review completed, um, no reviews completed, and then it would be additional filters that indicate whether or not reviews work, uh, submitted by specific types of users.
So the first would be the evaluators second would be evaluate teas and the third would be the, uh, program administrators.
So then it would allow them to filter and get the information to what they need. And we don&#39;t have to remove that functionality for the students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c4bedc9ca7db4e129ccbab50fada1f4a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of October 23, 2022 - 28 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>All right, so this is a, a few b tweaks that we can do to clean up the curriculum. One thing is When we arrive on the courses page we have these view board.
More buttons only show these buttons if there&#39;s something to be. Otherwise they shouldn&#39;t show anything. So for example, there&#39;s no description that needs to be expanded, so there&#39;s no need to show these here.
On the right side, let&#39;s make this top section a little bit smaller and put the button in a way that it&#39;s not touching the top right, so there&#39;s some padding around it.
So clean up that ui and then if we go to sessions, if I select this here, I want to add a new session, I save and I save it.
One thing we can do is if I accidentally click data here, we should make it so that you have to click save or cancel cuz fax and I click on it, I lose all the content that I&#39;m writing.
So we should, we can make it so that you have to click save or cancel to get out of this.
And if I save this success, so it saves it, but I can&#39;t see it unless I refresh the page. And then if I refresh the page, I lose every, all the course that I picked.
So what we wanna do is make sure that this is showing up without having to refresh the page so when I save, it shows up on the page.
And then from here, also we can remove the view more buttons. If there&#39;s nothing to expand, it should only show up if there&#39;s something to expand.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/61fd92db24f54907bc7eb21c29c24bea</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Block schedule</pre></td><td><pre>&lt;affirmative&gt; block schedule functionality. So the way that we want to set up these block schedules is in a way that it allows you to have separate schedules for each of the each of the student cohorts.
So CVM four, like here, blue schedule. And we create that by clicking the new schedule and then selecting the appropriate academic period.
So if we are missing any academic periods, we can create more. And I think one of the things that we may want to do is set up two academic periods.
One for the cohort that starts one for the blue cohort and one for the civil cohort. And this is something that we can discuss in a future meeting for now.
You can select one of the ones that&#39;s available and we can change this later if necessary. And then giving it the name.
And then we don&#39;t need to select any sites here. By default, all sites will be included. We don&#39;t need to select any scheduled supervisors.
And then for roles, we have added those CVM rolls here. So if it&#39;s a blue calendar schedule, you can select blue and then you can skip groups.
You can skip individuals. And then you can also skip the view of the access. And then the auto generate functionality can be used to generate those blocks if you wanna start with something.
But it&#39;s also possible for these blocks to be created manually. And it may be easier to do that since you already have a predefined block set.
So all of these other items can be left alone. And then so also if you&#39;re auto generating the blocks, they start at the first day of the academic period.
So if you want to, if, if it says an offset, let&#39;s say it starts on two days before or two days after, you can offset that by turning this on.
And this prevents it from creating any blocks less than a week. But let&#39;s go back to this page and that this schedule that was already created, you can go to manage blocks, and here&#39;s where you, you can create new blocks with the start date and end date, or you can modify existing blocks.
And these blocks can also be deleted and edited as needed. And once it&#39;s set up, you can click on it to view it.
And if you ever want to go back and edit any of the settings, such as a name description, you do that here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b6646c0ec2d44d94848f5967a2ea2088</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 30 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Okay.

Um, what we want to show is the roles that are on this schedule under here, similar to what we show on the admin portal.
Um, let me see if I have an admin portal set loaded up here. Oh, So you can see here, it shows the, uh, roles here.
And if there&#39;s a description, we can also show that under there is a description and then the right side, if there&#39;s nothing to show for last modified, let&#39;s not show anything here because this looks like it&#39;s broken.
And for the personal portal, if the simple view is not viewable, uh, we could, I&#39;m not sure why this is if it&#39;s, if this per user does not have permission to view the simple view, um, we should, uh, disable it.
And I believe it&#39;s because it&#39;s disabled because this is a medical student program. So there&#39;s a medical student program and is viewing on the personal portal.

So I just saw all of these various ways that we&#39;re mapping or housing our curriculum, and you have to go and ask so many people for things or they have to download something out of Blackboard.
So just being a new person coming in, wanting to learn it and see it. I couldn&#39;t see it. So that was driving it, um, just for that transparency of the curriculum so that faculty could, you know, review, revise things, look for gaps and redundancies without having to go to multiple sources.
And, and it sounds like you had some exposure to these types of systems on the medicine side. So, so it was, it was it almost just a, almost a small translation step for you to see?
Well, here&#39;s where the technology is going over on the medicine side. So it makes sense just to extend it over here.
Yeah. Yeah. I just, I was surprised that they didn&#39;t have something like this, but, but the accreditation isn&#39;t driving it that hard of, you know, needing to see everything.
So as you think of say that the next five years you feel like accreditation will move in that direction or, or do you feel like, no, we&#39;re, we&#39;re doing this for us.
We&#39;re doing this because this is better for our school, regardless of what accreditation does or are you trying to get in front of that, correct?
No, it definitely, I think, and Dr. Keel, the assistant Dean of academic and faculty affairs, she sees the value in it regardless.
I mean, I don&#39;t think that the CCNY is going to come in and say, you know, we&#39;re opening a CIA portal and you have to upload every year.
I don&#39;t see that in five years. Um, Follow up question on that. And, and this is, this is me. I I&#39;m a writer.
I, I know so little about nursing and everything. I&#39;m learning about medicine, I&#39;m learning from Tosh and the team, but, but just talk to me about nursing in general.
Why, why wouldn&#39;t the CCNY go in that direction? It&#39;s just because it&#39;s too difficult to do. There&#39;s too much variation in the programs.
I&#39;m not sure. Cause again, I&#39;m, I&#39;ve been here five years, but I still five years here is not the same at medicine.
Like I feel like medicine is this accelerated speed of tracking and hot topics drive. Like if you know what the hot topics like one year you better put it in there.
Like it&#39;s a warning. So I don&#39;t know it. And this might just be our school, but it&#39;s, it doesn&#39;t seem to move that fast as medicine.
Um, you know, but the last, since their last visit, 10 years ago, there is dramatic change there just with moving from paper to digital and other systems.
So I, I mean, I immediately see in the site visit materials and with the AACN essentials, which I think they&#39;ll move to competency-based in 20, 23 or four.
So that&#39;s a definite article right. There is how do we use curriculum mapping to facilitate this transition? So that&#39;s for a faculty to do.
Um, so I, yeah, I just see this as a, as an amazing tool to help with internal review and revision, but then to populate those state national reports, regardless of if they say you need to have this tool, I just, and for longevity and faculty turnover and retirements, nursing&#39;s going to have a massive Exodus because of retirement in the next five years.
So I think we have to have, you know, our archives in, uh, in better shape. Well, one of the things that usually drives these kinds of things is money.
And, uh, meaning like when there, if there is any, every, any push from the federal government to reimburse for training for nursing, um, then there becomes more drive towards standardization across the country.
And then it&#39;s like, how do you standardize? And you need to have standard common set of standards that they have to adhere to.
And then for example, the AC GME and the milestones and all that kind of stuff. So if th if that could be one reason that this happens, but I agree with you in terms of implementing something like this on a national level, it&#39;s hard for an organization like CCNY.
And I think even the AMC, they&#39;re only starting to find their footing with the C C I a for all these years.
Um, what, what, from a, from a institutional perspective, I feel like you can still come off as an organization that is leading a change that others can follow.
And, and then kind of driving that as you&#39;re the first organization to do it, and then motivating other nursing schools to follow.
And then it, and it&#39;s an, it&#39;s a good place to one, establish a name for your school as an cause.
Every, every time there&#39;s some big change, it always comes from this one organization or the innovators, I think so, rather than looking at it from a we&#39;ll CCNY, do it or not, when, like you said, it doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re doing it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/706de9ec8ea4400db77dff6f605b9d22</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Request Rotation (Copy) – Figma - 27 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey ship. So let&#39;s try this again. Hopefully this is sharing my screen. This project is going to focus on updating the student and resident portals or the personal portal, and we&#39;re gonna be adding the, the part one of this is gonna be updating the schedules page to show the alright, show the so right now it, if someone is on this page, it only shows the current academic period as a schedule.
Instead of doing that, we&#39;re gonna take the same view that we have in the admin portal. So if I go into the admin portal And go to call an education, you&#39;ll see that we have this view and it allows us to see the contact information as well as download a pdf and we don&#39;t need to include the shifts, just the top section here, clinical experience.
And we&#39;re basically taking that and applying to the schedules page on the student portal. And one thing we wanna do is reverse the order.
We wanna put the newer rotation at the top. So the current academic period that&#39;s new is the top and then the older ones at the bottom.
So that&#39;s the first part. Then the second part is going to be gonna add a setting on systems setup rotations.
So when you open up a rotation and system setup, we&#39;ll add a checkbox that says allow trainee to swap rotation assignment.
So if that is turned on, we&#39;ll show these buttons, request change. Clicking on that will bring up a modal where they can select that they wanna do a different rotation during this timeframe.
This gets a little tricky because we&#39;re gonna allow them the opportunity to select an existing site and rotation, or they can submit new sites.
So there&#39;s a multiple combinations of this. So they can request a site and then that already exists in the system.
And then request a rotation that already exists in the system and then pick administrators and preceptors that are already in the, or they can request a site that exists in the system and then submit a new rotation that doesn&#39;t exist in the system with new administrators and new preceptors.
So to do this, so the first thing is they select a site and it goes to select site. They pick one that exists in the system and we will show, well as soon as they press continue.
Next it&#39;ll show up this option, select an existing rotation, or I could not find the rotation in this list. If I choose existing rotation, we&#39;ll show the list of administrators and rotation supervisors that are on that rotation.
So if I go back to our admin portal under rotations, you&#39;ll see that if I open up a rotation, we have rotation administrators, and then we have rotation supervisors.
So anybody that&#39;s selected at the top here. And what we&#39;re doing is listing the, their information out with the name, email, and phone number.
Now let&#39;s say if we go back here and it says, I could not find this rotation, then they&#39;ll be given the opportunity to select a specialty.
So this specialty is a list of the rotations that are under core rotations. So anybody, anything that&#39;s classified as rotation will be shown in there.
And then, so this is a, they have a, we have a site that already exists in the system, but they could not find a rotation.
So they&#39;re able to type in the rotation name. And then since the site exists, we can select, we could show a dropdown of all the users that are faculty or staff user type that have this site as the home institution.
And they can pick up someone as administrator or they can say, I could not find the administrator here. And it&#39;ll give them a fields to enter the first, last name, first name, last name, email address, and phone number.
Four fields. Same thing for rotation supervisor. They can select a, it will show a list of all the users in metrics that have faculty or staff, user type and home institution as metrics hospital east.
And they&#39;ll be able to pick one. But if they don&#39;t find the person they&#39;re looking for, they&#39;ll choose this and have the same four fields.
First name, last name, email, and phone number. So if once they enter that they can select the rotation date, start date, and end date, add an attachment, write notes, and submit it.
Let&#39;s say if they go back to here and right from the beginning they say, I don&#39;t find the site. So if they don&#39;t find the site, we&#39;re give them the ability to enter the site name, first name ad, I mean the site name, address, city, state, zip.
And then it&#39;ll go through the same process here where they&#39;re not going to have a, since the site doesn&#39;t exist, there&#39;s no way that the rotation can exist.
There&#39;s no way the rotation administrator can exist and there&#39;s no way that the rotation supervisor can exist. So it&#39;ll, if the site doesn&#39;t exist, we&#39;re pretty much gonna give them the option to select a specialty.
Then they wouldn&#39;t even have to pick these two, we&#39;ll just give them four fields to enter the administrator, four fields to enter the precep preceptor, and then select a date at attachment and submit this.
So it, so we&#39;ll show it appropriate sections based on what&#39;s available in the system and we&#39;ll be using the home institution to identify rotation administrators and rotation supervisors.
And remember, home institution is the same as site. And then the specialty is gonna be the list of rotations that are added into system setup, Sorry, a great, a great book setup as rotations, so a T 1 0 1 biology and so on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7beb21c37c034f508ae8eb5695e237f4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So these are some usability things that we could address in a future sprint. I wanted to make the videos for you, Well video for you so that you have it.
The whenever we&#39;re on the demo, I mean on the curriculum page, there&#39;s, we have the ability to add courses, well some, some minor tweaks that can be done here to just clean up, Let the view more shouldn&#39;t show up.
If there&#39;s nothing to view, there&#39;s no description, it doesn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t need to show up. We can also update this button to be centered.
And then for set sessions when you&#39;re adding a new session, it doesn&#39;t show up on the page until you refresh it.
So we wanna update that so it does show up cuz otherwise you have to refresh the page and then you have to select the course again for you to be able to view that.
So updating the page upon saving is, is one thing. And then the view more shouldn&#39;t show up on this page either unless there&#39;s something to view and there was something else.
The other tweak is on the upload csb, there&#39;s a little check box that says Remu remove existing session schedules from sessions in the upload.
This is a very confusing piece of text here. We want, What we wanna change that to is when uploading Schedules to a session, remove all existing schedules actually when, when uploading sch schedules to a session, remove all existing schedules.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/195d2d725d8948d4b28fc10cdd2cffde</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Eval Summary - Google Sheets - 20 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Maria. So this is more of a question on how do we wanna structure this data. If I go to this page and I run a report for a particular course, you&#39;ll see that it gives me the option to group by the course, or I can group by the evaluat t.
It doesn&#39;t let me group by evaluate T within a course. So I can say, How did Abe perform on course A versus how did A perform on course B?
So we can build more advanced filtering here where you do multiple filters, but that&#39;s more of difficult for us to do.
So what I&#39;m hoping is if you run this report and then we add a download report to Excel option, whatever responses you generate, it will dump that data with more columns so that you could filter this external excel to metrics.
But we have to keep in mind that there are 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 types of evaluations and we had to factor all of that in.
So here&#39;s what I came up with and you can look at it and see if there&#39;s a better way to do this.
So I have evaluator, first name, evaluator, last name, evaluator role evaluator&#39;s, home institution, so that if they need to filter by that, they can, we can dump that on there.
Evaluate t&#39;s first name, evaluate T&#39;s last name, evaluate T role, evaluate T&#39;s home institution, course code, course name, rotation code, rotation name, event name session coach, session name.
So if it&#39;s a course evaluation, you&#39;ll see this, You won&#39;t see all of these other ones. If it&#39;s a rotation one, you&#39;ll see this, but you won&#39;t see the other ones and so on.
And then when you get to the questions, you have question a, question A mean response A for that question along with the response, A count response a percent response B, response B count response B percent.
And this is coming from, this is what the PDF looks like right now. You can see that as a question and the the mean as well as total responses and percentage.
So I can call this percentage. So that&#39;s what this report looks like. And then for text questions, we just comment questions.
We just dump it at the bottom as text.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6291ee435f6d4553a304e3d70f8acc1c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calendly - 24 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Am Mike. Hopefully you can hear me with the, uh, white nose and noise in the background for the baby. Um, so I, this is the administrative side of candidly and you can get in here using our hello and metrics, lab.com.
I believe you have access to it through one pass. Um, what I would like you to do is look at this managed events section and then basically create a word document that pulls in the different sections that we can configure.
So for example, even name, description, the, uh, um, the availability, um, add time before and after events, any additional settings.
The reason I&#39;m saying to put this into a word document, um, in a table or something like that, Or maybe even, uh, a spreadsheet, we can put them to a spreadsheet, um, so that when we create a bunch of different templates, so what are we going to do is create, these are different types of meetings that are in here right now, but we may create one called support meeting customer success, meeting, uh, sales, uh, discovery call for each of those meetings.
We&#39;re going to configure the settings in here, and it&#39;d be easier if we have a spreadsheet or something that we can update for all the different templates during Jerry&#39;s meeting.
Um, notice how there&#39;s the additional options we can even add custom questions here. So what we want to do is during the meeting, come up with questions that we can use to collect agenda items, um, from the clients, there&#39;s also notification settings confirmation page, where we can show there and the payments, it doesn&#39;t matter.
We&#39;re not collecting payments, but basically looking at all these settings and seeing what, uh, what are the configurable options we have and then putting that on a spreadsheet, into separate roles.
And then for each, sorry, separate columns. And then for each event type that we create, we&#39;ll create a separate row in there with the appropriate settings that we want to use here.
And then we&#39;ll come back and set it all up for everybody. Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e63a8f750a194879bd468d5dad9eb088</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Schedules Request Task</pre></td><td><pre>So this particular project is going to be complex. I wanted to explain some background here. For our medical school clients, they have medical students that are going through rotations during the third and fourth year.
And for the third year class, they do mandatory rotations, and it&#39;s scheduled at the hospitals that they have agreements with.
But for their fourth year class, the students are allowed to take elective rotations anywhere in the world, so they can go to any hospital, and the school doesn&#39;t know where they&#39;re gonna go in advance.
So the students need to have a way to submit a request for the rotations they wanna do, and then the administrators to have a way to approve it once that request is submitted.
So that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna be working on in this particular task. So in this student portal or, and the resident portal we&#39;re gonna be adding some changes.
But before we get there, in the administrative portal, under system setup rotations for a particular rotation, we&#39;re gonna add a setting that says allow trainee to swap rotation assignment.
And this is if it&#39;s checked off or turned on, then we will allow them to submit requests. So on the student or resident portal, we are going to have a request change button appear if the rotation allows for switching and it, and the rotation is in the future.
So if the rotation has already passed, it&#39;s in the past, or it&#39;s act, it&#39;s if it&#39;s currently happening, or if it&#39;s it&#39;s active right now, we&#39;re not gonna allow them to switch it.
But if it&#39;s in the future and the rotation allows for it to be switched, will show these two checkbox two these buttons.
We&#39;re also adding a new request button at the top which is gonna function the same way. The only difference is that we&#39;re not going to, And when this model comes up, instead of rotation change request, it&#39;ll show new request.
And it&#39;s not gonna show this section at the top. But we&#39;ll handle that in a separate task. So let&#39;s say we, someone comes in here and clicks request change, We&#39;re gonna walk them through the change request, and it&#39;s gonna have a few different components to it.
So let me just go towards the end and then it&#39;ll come back. So for a rotation, we&#39;re gonna allow them to first select a site if they, if this that exists in the system, if that site doesn&#39;t exist, we&#39;re gonna give them a way to create a site.
And then if the site does exist, we&#39;re gonna let them select an existing rotation, or they can create a rotation.
And then if the site does not exist, or the rotation does not exist, we&#39;ll give them a way to create a new rotation.
And that&#39;s going to be selecting a specialty, which is, which is gonna show the graded course rotations that we have in the system.
And if that actually this get rid of this, this. So if they, if the rotation does not exist, they will select a specialty and then they will specify the administrator for that rotation.
And this is gonna allow them to search and find users in our system. If they cannot find an administrator, they&#39;ll be able to check the second box and they&#39;ll bring up a bunch of fields and they can enter name, first name, last name, email address, and phone number to create a submitted administrator than for preceptors.
We&#39;re gonna let them search for it, and if they cannot find it, they&#39;ll be able to create a preceptor with the same type of fields.
So for us to accomplish this, we have to make some backend models to support this. So we&#39;re gonna have schedule requests.
It&#39;s gonna have the user ID field for the person that is requesting the change. The site ID field, if the site already exists in the system, the rotation ID field is gonna reference the rotation if the rotation already exists in the system.
And then same thing for administrator supervisor, it&#39;s gonna indicate the user ID that if they exist, and let&#39;s say if they don&#39;t exist if a site doesn&#39;t exist, they&#39;ll be able to type in the name, address, city, state, zip.
And if the administrator does not exist, they&#39;ll be able to type in the first name, last name email address and phone, and then indicate whether it&#39;s an administrator or a preceptor.
And that&#39;s gonna store it in this re schedule request staff mo model. And so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the first part. At the bottom, there&#39;s also a way For them to select the rotation, start date, end date, and attach a document and add notes.
So we have start date, end date applicant note, administrative note. That&#39;s gonna be handled later. And then schedule request attachment is gonna capture the attachment.
So going back to the beginning now, So we&#39;re gonna start our journey here where it says, select an affiliate site.
They&#39;ll select a site and or they&#39;ll say the site does not exist. If it does exist, they&#39;ll be able to pick a rotation.
And the rotation is going to if, if it does exist in the system, they&#39;ll be able to continue select that and it&#39;ll show the administrators and the preceptors for that.
So the administrators are gonna be the rotation administrators and the preceptors are gonna be any of the rotation supervisors that are linked to that rotation.
Then if I say I could not find the rotation in the list, then we&#39;re gonna give them a way to create the rotation by selecting the specialty.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e23bd157a9ee4971aa60212f9a736fb8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LMU 2 Pager – Figma - 19 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, Mike. So I made a couple of tweaks here to the text. One thing that we want to make sure is the website and email address needs to be more prominent, so they know how to contact us.
Um, in this case, probably not as warm since we&#39;re emailing them. Um, I&#39;m thinking that, Um, Actually let&#39;s not worry about it too much.
I&#39;m like we can probably just take this out and use, uh, this area to say what our website and email.
I don&#39;t think we need to label it as web and email because it&#39;s still be able to see it. So it&#39;d be website.
Let me see. Uh, Alexander has a hat on as I was admiring that. Um, now I&#39;m on a video recording, a video, uh, metric cloud.com and we want to align this with the tax.
I think we can probably get away with minimal</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5f961e05b93e46bc958c069a4491c641</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Request Rotation (Copy) – Figma - 19 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>All right. So for the second task, we&#39;re gonna be adding a way for the students to request new rotations. And this is gonna include some back end and front up changes.
So there&#39;s where we&#39;ll be adding a update to the edit rotation page, and we&#39;ll add a new setting that says allow trainee to swap rotation assignment.
Or we can say, allow trainees to, let&#39;s change it, to allow trainees to request rotation changes. And when this is enabled, we will see the request change button next to those rotations, but only for the rotations that are in the future.
So if the rotation has already completed, or if it&#39;s act happening right now, they won&#39;t be able to change it.
They&#39;ll at least see this button. If this checkbox is enabled and the rotation is in the future, then what we can do is when the student clicks on request change, it&#39;s going to bring up a modal and it&#39;s going to allow them to submit a change request.
And how that works is the first thing that is gonna show is the select and affiliate site field. And once the affiliate site field is Selected, they&#39;ll be able to choose a rotation.
If the rotation is in the system and they select it, then they can select then they can select the administrator, and then they can select the preceptor.
So essentially they&#39;re going through a pathway of selecting the site, selecting rotation, selecting the administrator, then selecting a preceptor. But there&#39;s a few different variations of this.
If they say they cannot find the site, then we&#39;re going to allow them to enter the site. So it&#39;s gonna have the site, a site address, and then they would continue and that would allow them to select a.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cbf70e6af3c543d7a2c9b75fd7c5fc16</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Intercom - 24 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Libby.

Let&#39;s look at this one. If I choose this, it would allow me to select for exam a course, and I can run that for the course, or I can choose evaluator and run it for evaluator, but, or evaluate T.
But I cannot get data on how Abe Wheeler performed in a particular course. So what I wanna do is, let&#39;s, let&#39;s say if I run this, that may be too much data.
So here&#39;s what that format looks like. It has the, so let, if I run the report for evaluat, it&#39;ll show the grouping on the top and then each of the questions, the responses with the percentage and the mean.
So if we turn this into a Excel, we would want to put the course information, the course code course title as well as the evaluator evaluator role, and the course start date, and the course end date in separate columns with the question.
And each of the, Each of these and do a separate column. So it&#39;s, we don&#39;t need every single entry separate, but we wanna show it as question number one, and then the options with total responses for each and percentages for each.
So it&#39;ll be one role for each question, and for each option, we say, still strongly disagree, will be one column, and then next to it, it&#39;ll show the count of zero, then disagree, then count for that, then neutral, then count for that and then percentages to the right side of that.
So I may try to explain that in a, in English, so we have question then each of the options with the total responses and percentages next to it in separate columns.
So, strongly agree that strongly disagree.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/39cf48f5f44e437cbaac97df08060793</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 19 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys.

And you don&#39;t see any data if you are, if you don&#39;t have anything entered for the current academic period. So what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re gonna change this and use this user interface.
And this is actually from, let me see if I can pull up a, Okay. We can, you can see here on the user overview page, we have this view.
We&#39;re gonna copy this. Actually what we can do is, while we&#39;re updating this, we can also update this page to make sure that the newer rotations show up at the top.
And we can do the same thing here and copy this view. Put the newer rotation at the top. And we&#39;re not going to incorporate the the shift schedules here.
We&#39;re only gonna take the rotation schedules and we&#39;re not gonna incorporate the undergraduate and graduate school there either. So we&#39;ll leave the rotation schedules in the newer rotations showing up the top, and we&#39;ll show the download button if they wanna download to a pdf.

That means Hofstra&#39;s half Stroh&#39;s ID.
So each program has a specific account number. So I just populated based on the fact that you went to Hofstra URL.
Okay. Like the nurse practitioner ID is different, so it takes you into a separate thing. Um, this is nice. This is then we need to do, what&#39;s it very clear that you have your yeah.
Program administrator is the person to contact. Yeah. We need to put that front and center like they do. Yeah. So this is how you log a case and, And anesthesia, you have to like, uh, cause some of the things that like, if it&#39;s like a repeat, like bring back patient.
Yeah. That&#39;s something that is its own thing, because that means there was an issue a patient had or something let&#39;s make you select a patient and you do that.
No, you can, you can just say no, no, but if you do it, does it link it to the previous patient?
Um, yeah, it can, it can do that, but so far I haven&#39;t had any yeah. Cause that&#39;s something that we don&#39;t do.
Yeah. Your, each of your logs are separate. Yeah. Yeah. And then once you make the log, um, so this is like all our clinical sites there.
So you preload, like one of the thing cool. Things that they&#39;re doing is you get to choose your site and set it as your site.
Okay. So whenever I&#39;m filling out this form, it automatically like we already do that because your schedule automatically populates. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, and then we have to just punch in some of these random information. Um, if we did any of these, like when you look at this one, it&#39;s kind of very limited.
Yeah. On All kinds of, yeah, there don&#39;t, there&#39;s no mobile interface at all. Yeah. It&#39;s non-existent and then printable version.
So in Bernalillo, Virginia, you just click it and this exact same thing comes out on a piece of paper. So when you&#39;re in clinicals, since there&#39;s no mobile interface, you&#39;re hugging off, I see the dumbest thing in the world.
And once you log the case and if there&#39;s stuff missing, it alerts you to, okay, go back to this case, ID, click on it.
Those are all things that you&#39;re missing. You see what time logs, this is all stuff that we put in for what days were there?
How many hours, how do you log time? Oh, at timeline. Yeah. It&#39;s like it&#39;s yeah. It&#39;s pretty much like an Excel.
Like, well, it is simple. Yeah. It is very, very, how do you go back to the homepage? A main menu.
Oh, it&#39;s not like very, um, and then external documents is where we have to upload like three different things per, per day that we&#39;re there.
So we have a patient care plan. We have like a eval or like a reflection on how the day went.
My portfolio. This is like stuff where, so the ideal of it is like, you kind of set it up where someone else can see it.
Someone else can see it, but like it mainly. So like when you&#39;re applying for a job, you can be like, okay, here, these are all the cases that I did.
Yeah. For the past two years. Um, yeah. This is something that we don&#39;t do that, that has come up in meetings and I it&#39;d be nice to know what are some of the things that people usually present.
So that it&#39;s something that we can do in the future. Like besides case log, is there, what are some of the things that, um, yeah, I mean, like I I&#39;ve heard of people using it.
Like, I think it&#39;s more relevant towards the nurse practitioner because like, they can be like, oh, you know, this is a population that we took care of with anesthesia.
You have these like basic numbers that we have to hit for certain kinds of cases, uh, schedule you haven&#39;t used, um, tracks all are.
That&#39;s pretty nice. Yeah. This way, if there&#39;s any discrepancies. Yeah. Um, this one is what are, I mean like ultimate end of the day thing is that they want, By the time we graduate and this, this is what gets submitted to the licensing people.
And when they do that, they just, they have this like, um, go to case log and the real quick or all data points they have, I think, like, uh, export to Excel or whatever a PDF.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Yeah. There&#39;s definitely strengths here in terms of it being very simple and fast to the point, like, uh, um, we can definitely simplify and, and because we added the nursing stuff after we do all that residency stuff, so there&#39;s more functionality than they need.
I feel like if we simplify it, it&#39;s going to be easier. Um, but I, I definitely see the mobile as, as a human mobile needs to happen.
Yeah. I mean, this is like, cause our cases, like there&#39;s case, like certain days where I&#39;m doing like seven or eight cases and you&#39;re just running.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8601ab3c2ec74741af13797a5b139469</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi David. So during that last, uh, closure meeting, Dr. Warlow had brought up the fact that they&#39;re making competencies for their medical school and they wanted to see if we do competency based evaluation.
So I explained to her that we do it in the, um, residency, um, for residency programs. And we are also adding the way to do that on the medical school side.
And then after the meeting, I sent her reports of some of the things that we do for the GME side on, uh, running competency reports and CCC reports.
So the problem that they&#39;re going to face right now is if you go to the medic, anything that&#39;s classified as a medical school program, and they try to map, um, the question, then they&#39;re going to see their key objectives here.
This is something that we&#39;re replacing with the competencies. So, um, she&#39;s probably saying she seemed duplicates here and it&#39;s, this is not meant to be mapped at this time.
So what they need to do is simply get their course evaluation set up and get that going, and they can come back and map those competencies later.
And once we REO has a get lab issue open for us to apply the same mapping side that we have for the residency programs, for the UME programs.
And once that&#39;s done, this is what it&#39;s going to look like when they go and open up a form And click edit question, you&#39;ll see that we have competence.
Um, the, well, I should not be using a super out of in here templates. So you can see here. Now we&#39;re seeing the competencies for this program.
So this is no longer the Mo the objectives. This is going to be the competencies, and they&#39;ll be able to upload a set of competencies that they can use.
So what we can, I haven&#39;t read the email yet. I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at it yet. What if she&#39;s seeing those objectives as duplicates, or we need to tell her is, um, we, you will be able to add those competencies to the system and we have to load those competencies competencies and make them available to you right now.
You&#39;re seeing objectives in there because this is a, uh, we used to do a, do a mapping through objectives, but right now we&#39;re in the, in the process of updating it to competencies recommendations right now is to get those evaluations built out and, um, assigned.
And then you can always do those mappings afterwards, and all the data will be updated to reflect those mappings. Even the ones that are already submitted.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e531b9a3d6704e949f6ec1710b401e79</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>NEW CJ&#39;22 | Medtrics Labs | CIENCE - Onboarding Questionnaire (7/27/2022) - Google Docs - 3 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi for this, uh, story time section, I decided, I decided that I created a short video going over our story.
We started in 2013. I was a fourth year medical student at the time. And I had, had done some work in software design and during medical school.
And in created a, a mobile app, one of my faculty members who became an investor and advisor, um, he saw that, um, that interest in me and he encouraged me to create a tool that allows him to collect evaluations electronically, uh, for the, the residents that he was mentoring.
Uh, he encouraged me to also meet with Robbie Gupta, who was the program director of their residency for their residency.
So what their input and investment. Uh, we started the business in 2013 and then shortly afterwards, uh, 2014, Chris joined the team.
And in the beginning, we were simply focused on creating an evaluation system that was meant to solve some of the challenges that was brought on by the ACG meets next accreditation system.
So that was just our start. And so when we realized that we need more than any evaluation system, we expanded to various modules and on couple of institutions to be a pilot.
And then, um, eventually also started in 2016 to expand to the medical school market. And, uh, we became a vendor for the American association of medical colleges and their curriculum inventory.
So it started in the hospital, postgraduate market expanded into the undergraduate medical education with the medical school market. Um, and along the way our, uh, uh, priority or our mission, uh, has been to keep things simple and intuitive and, and focus on user experience.
Um, my personal passion for, uh, for product is, is the user experience aspect of it. Um, in addition to being a physician, I spent many years studying user UX and I have, uh, worked on designing, uh, many of the modules in the system.
Um, and then managing the, uh, development of that, those modules with the Chris, um, uh, once he joined the team.
So user experience is number one, and that is the number one reason that people switch over to us. We want to make, we always try to make the system approachable.
And as a company, we also go the extra mile to make sure that we are not just providing software, but also providing a, a team that can understand their needs and, um, uh, adapt to their, their, their, uh, unique workflows.
We also, over the years, tried to build a team that, um, has members that have worked in medical education. For example, Ken brown.
He was a hospital, uh, uh, residency coordinator for about 10 years. And then now he&#39;s full-time with us. Um, Maria is, she was in medical education also for about 10 years, and now she&#39;s on our team.
So by having these individuals join, um, and, uh, help us with our clients, we are able to understand their unique needs because medical education and healthcare in general has a lot of jargon and unique workflows.
It&#39;s hard to understand that unless there&#39;s some firsthand experience. Um, so the other thing that even from a brand, what we try to do is be approachable, uh, little things like, uh, in our, on our website, we have our cats and our pets up here.
Um, and even in these, we use these images in our application when, when a page has an error, um, one of these pets show up and give them an error message.
So being personable, being approachable is something that we&#39;ve been trying to do from an interface perspective, as well as a brand.
Um, and at the same time as a brand, we&#39;re also trying to be, um, as solve serious problems that the institutions have when it comes to making sure that they&#39;re compliant with requirements and collecting different reimbursements, they had to collect from the federal government.
So we&#39;re, we&#39;re addressing a serious operational challenges for the institution while coming off as a approachable, friendly, um, brand. This is somewhat unique in the market in healthcare general, which, which is filled with products that are very cold and robotic.
Um, so I think that&#39;s something that our customers definitely appreciate about us also, um, as a team, we are also, um, trying to, um, uh, build a solution that is an all in one platform for healthcare.
And this is from first day of medical school, till you&#39;re practicing medicine and independently, we want to be able to manage all the data and workflows associated with it.
So this has been a unique area of our business. While other companies have been focusing on specific segments of the education market or specific, um, types of software, we&#39;ve been trying to go for a more broad approach when it comes to their, their needs.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ea1c06fb0b9a410098f4c3c96ce3ac16</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leads | Medtrics Lab - Real | Close - 10 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi David. So I&#39;ve been doing some, uh, smart views here for the sake of automation, and I wanna explain what I&#39;ve done so that you can help, uh, finish some of these things up.
And on the left side, um, we have, um, client renewal, disqua client mini, uh, missing renewal date, missing data, and, uh, act active leads LinkedIn networking.
So first thing that I did was I added a few, um, custom fields on the, uh, lead itself. And this includes the, um, Uh, current contract url, uh, Confluence page url, current invoice url, next renewal date, and current start date.
And the idea is that whenever a new contract is signed, we put this information in here and every year when there&#39;s a renewal, we update this.
And then the task management is one of the things that is really lacking in close. And our goal is to automate everything into Jira anyway.
So what I wanna do is we have these custom fields and then these smart views is, will allow us to trigger task creation using Zap here in, in, uh, Jira.
So for example, renewals this quarter, if I go here, and this is constantly gonna be looking at the data and it&#39;s gonna show, pull up any items that have a, um, renewal date that this quarter.
And as soon as that happens, a zap here trigger cuz smart views can trigger, um, an action in Jira. So essentially when, as soon as this something shows up here, it can trigger a task creation in Jira.
Another one is for this renewal date is super important. So I created a dedicated, um, smart view for this. So I think this one is incorrect.
Let me do art ad filter leads, current status is client, then Next renewal date is not present, so none of them, So I&#39;m gonna do this, I&#39;m gonna save this.
So now it&#39;s basically have all of these that are missing. So the best to update all this before we set it in the automation so that, uh, it doesn&#39;t create a whole bunch of tasks.
Then there&#39;s missing, uh, data. So if it&#39;s missing these critical information, then it&#39;ll also create a task. And then the active net, um, LinkedIn network is essentially, uh, there&#39;s a checkbox on the contact that confirms whether we added them on LinkedIn as our, our friend or whatever.
Um, and if it we haven&#39;t done it, then it will create a task here. So the the goal is, um, we put these things into close, and then as things get picked up by these smart views, it, it uses Zapier to trigger a task in Jira and assign it to the appropriate person.
So for example, all of the renewals should go to Ken. All of the, uh, LinkedIn stuff should go to the person that&#39;s on the CRM as the lead.
Um, and in missing data also should go to the same person that&#39;s managing the lead. Um, and then, um, in Jira itself, I&#39;ve been, um, looking at the projects and the different types of projects they have.
And I, I realized that when Libby set this up, she being a product manager for software, used a software project type for our business project.
And, um, Jira has a project type that is meant to be used for business tasks. And, uh, I think we need to start using that, um, instead of this ops, which is a software project, and it makes it a lot more easier to manage and have business tasks, um, tracked that way.
So there is something called growth ops that we&#39;re not using yet. You can use to experiment with Zapier and, um, and don&#39;t send it to Ops yet.
The, the goal is that once we figure out some more details, we can use growth ops for business related items and then ops can just stay as is for any development backlog.
Um, so those are the things that I spent some time over the weekend sorting out the, what you can look into is, um, SAP here and seeing how we can turn this into task in Jira and their growth ops.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0e967f9ccf8e41449328bb30eae8c7db</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calendly - 7 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So when you log in, um, I&#39;ve already made you an admin on here and you can see you have your own url and at the top you can set, you can sync up your calendar and set your availability.
And in the future, if you need to meet with a client or something, you&#39;ll have your own url. The other thing that I wanted your help with is if you go into admin management, um, you&#39;re gonna see managed events.
And here is where we want to edit these events and create the ones that were discussed during, um, the meeting with, uh, Jerry.
So I click, um, uh, we wanna create three group events, um, where multiple invitees to at one time. Um, I think it&#39;s gonna be group event, uh, where we can specify, um, different URLs for each type of event.
So one for, um, customer success, one for implementation, or we can call it onboard. And third one for sales, sales onboard, and, uh, CS for customer success.
So each of these event types will appear here, and then we can put different, uh, team members in here. And then, so for example, this one, I can assign a group for customer success, And then anybody that&#39;s part of the customer success group, um, can be, um, can sync up their calendar.
And then let&#39;s say if someone needs to meet with, uh, uh, a customer success team and they select a specific time, it will be added to one of the available team members&#39; calendars.
So, um, what we can do is essentially remove all of these events and start creating new ones based on the discussions that you had, uh, uh, with Jerry on that spreadsheet.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/168524c729994a20949db3e36af378df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Connected Accounts Settings | Medtrics Lab - Real | Close - 7 October 2022</pre></td><td><pre>I can, So we&#39;ve been looking at a meeting to go over the renewals and it doesn&#39;t look like we have all the details.
So some of, uh, all the details for the renewals, uh, you know, got Garnet and, um, couple other ones. Uh, we got Slack messages and, but I, I&#39;m not sure who, um, we need to follow up with.
So when you get this message, uh, if you&#39;re have access to a computer, it&#39;d be helpful if you can set up your email in close.
So you can use a one password login for close. Um, there&#39;s two accounts for close, one for my cell phone for David Ward.
And when you get in here, what you can do is go into settings on the left side, go to the connected accounts, and then click add account.
And you can add your Gmail account. Once your Gmail account is added here, what you could do, what close will do is for any of the, uh, contacts that we track in, um, close for each of our clients, the messages that were sent from any of us will get pulled in.
Um, so once this is at, once this is set up, um, if you can let me know who we&#39;re talking to for Harrison Wise, Text Ds, and the Ultimate, then I can make sure that those emails are in there and we can, uh, see what conversations are have happened and pick up that follow up.

Um, I started the company back in 2013 while I was a fourth year medical student.
Essentially at that time, I was working as a student with a faculty member, um, who was on our website, let&#39;s see Melina.
And he was my faculty. And we spent a lot of time during the day going over different types of cases.
And I noticed that he was always using a paper evaluation form when he had to evaluate his residents. And this kind of got a conversation going.
I had always, um, been into software design and, uh, he learned that about me and he encouraged me to design a, a software interface for collecting evaluations electronically.
Uh, then he introduced me to Robby Gupta, which, um, ended up being a great, um, collaborative relationship over the years.
They, both of them encouraged me to continue with that project and even, uh, invested in the, the initial launch of the business.
And over the next, uh, couple of years, I recruited a couple of team members and we, um, started building the evaluation system.
And, uh, Chris came on as the first a us team member. And we, uh, worked together to get a couple of pilots going and soon realized that we have to add more functionality to the system and eventually became a platform that manages all areas of healthcare education.
And, um, as a company we&#39;ve been focused primarily on user experience and making sure that the system is really intuitive and approachable.
And, uh, my personal passion in technology is, uh, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e6051b5bbdc142e290265f4349bf7039</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 3 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Carson. So here is a summary of how the competency reports work. So we can see on the performance page, we have a competency tab and all of these tabs here relate to the competency, uh, reports.
Um, so first one is competency report that is pulling every single submission that has a student or resident had during a selected date range.
So I selected an individual here with this specific date range, and then when I run the report, it will pull all those evaluations and then group their submissions under the appropriate competencies.
So you can see patient care. So the core competency, and then this is the first sub competency. And then there are several questions that are under the sub competency, deliver succinct, appropriate to St.
Hypothesis driven oral presentations. And you can see, these are the different responses that this resident received. And we have an average on the right side for this resident and then the peer average and the total points is simply adding up the values of each of these submissions and showing how many points is not as useful for most programs.
But you&#39;ll see there, the average here and the peer average, and then the roll those questions up, and we&#39;ll give you the average for the sub competency and at the top average for the competency itself.
And there&#39;s also a chart that gets put together for each of the competencies. As you scroll down, you can see there&#39;s medical knowledge as a second sub competency and the same type of information.
And we could also notice that, um, The color coding, if it&#39;s something that is in the lower third of the range, it will be red.
It was in the mid middle. Third is going to be orange. And then the top third is going to be, um, green.
So in this particular instance, I believe it&#39;s a nine point scale and that&#39;s why the threes are red. And the, um, the five is an orange.
So it was a eight or nine, then it would be, um, that will be green. So this, this can be customized depending on your scale.
And then we also have this report. Let&#39;s see if we can pick Um, that essentially summarizes the data into a PDF.
Um, I can share that on my screen right now. However, I&#39;ll send it as an attachment. Uh, when I sent this video, there&#39;s also a competency charts that we can pick an individual and compare.
We always have to pick a date range. Yeah, no data was found. Let&#39;s try another person. Sorry about that. Um, so you can see here, these are the spider graphs that gets created based on those, um, uh, competency averages.
So you have with the patient care, what the training you got and what the peer got. Um, so sometimes if the peer data is not showing it, maybe because with the averages were not calculated, you can see how this trainee is performing below the peer.
And there&#39;s also a scatter plot here that gets generated. Yeah, sometimes it takes a little while. So this training has many submissions over a period of time, and it&#39;s showing you where all those submissions are.
42, the sub-competencies. And then there&#39;s also a way to do a CCC review where you can select a particular trainee and add a review of when, what, what, uh, where they stand on that particular competency.
So on patient care, if you believe there are, let&#39;s say a four out of five, we can put that in and put in feedback, and that will be visible to the trainee in their portal, except for the confidential feedback.
So these are some of the ways that the competencies can be used for tracking their progression through the medical education.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b9b2c81f005a47e090b93757d0891e90</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>DC Budget Notes Aug 2022 - Google Docs - 1 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>David, thank you for going through this. So my comments on this for the first part, yes, this is going to be a adjustment on the accruing accounts.
Payable is not an increase on top of pros previously discussed. It&#39;s gonna be changed on that and the milestone was not reached yet, but the term, the agreements did have a statement that says we can make adjustments outside of that.
So this is, uh, um, based on a discussion with both of them, uh, about needing a raise and, uh, uh, based on some of the newer numbers that I&#39;m seeing may need to lower this a little bit and maybe do a second round later in the year.
Um, however, this is based on, um, what was already being agreed on with each person and we&#39;re simply decreased the accounts payable rate.
Um, I will look at the numbers again tonight or tonight and see if we can do the full 6,500 or it needs to be lowered a little bit, have not discussed anything with Gira marina.
Marina did have that raise earlier this year, I believe, uh, from 2 35 and $45 and $35, I believe. Um, she should have a raise.
I don&#39;t remember the exact number. Um, earlier this year, Ghia have not spoke to him about that yet. Um, and it will be helpful to know when he had the last race.
Uh, this is, uh, this is a good, it would be, it would be great. Great. If you can give me a number for each of these, each of the devs on what they&#39;re clocking in now, I didn&#39;t dollar amount.
So I&#39;m gonna plug that in. Um, I&#39;ll update this. So on these items here, the, if there is no new money coming in, can expenses be paid here?
So how long? So that, from what I saw was the main purpose of this tool. So at the, at the bottom I have, we have expenses and income, and if there is no new money coming in this at the top is the burn rate.
Um, and, uh, how much money it&#39;s left and if I can also turn things on and off by clicking on it so that I can hide certain items from the calculation.
Um, and also if something is supposed to come in on 11 1:00 AM, and if it&#39;s late, I can always just adjust the date here.
And all the math will be updated based on that. Um, and it&#39;s also calculated yearly or monthly or whatever the recurrence is.
And if there&#39;s say sales leads that are not closed yet can have that in here and have it hidden or, um, disabled until it&#39;s actually finalize and include include in the calculation.
So this is, um, what I&#39;m seeing here is basically a runway of how many months of money is left with there&#39;s nothing new coming in.
Um, so the new, uh, this is a good point. So if there&#39;s So all up, if the budget is accurate and all of the expenses are being captured in the budget, um, so if someone, if, for example, our devs are going over budget, then the budget needs to be adjusted based on that.
And if there are some expenses that is not captured in here, it needs to be adjusted. And then outside of that, there&#39;s the initial, uh, number that I pulled on seven nine.
And if we want to update this on a monthly basis, we can go in there, look at the bank, put the number in and then update this number.
So, and then all of the other numbers in here with the dates would factor in that new number and, uh, give us a balance.
Um, this, the caveat here is if there&#39;s something that&#39;s not captured in the budgets over having some conference expenses that is not in here, then it will throw off the budget otherwise, um, it should give, it may not be like exact to the dollar amount, but it should give us a general idea of how many months of money that&#39;s left based on the, uh, the balance.
All right. So Yeah, every month adjusting it. So this is something that can be done here also by simply changing the dates on when the payments are coming in.
Yeah. So this is also a good point. Um, it will not be, can I be estimator? It will be on time.
So the idea would be in that case to have it budgeted so that it would factor in whatever the highest amount it could be.
So if we have, so that&#39;s something that I can work on, uh, adjusting here or capture some extra budget item here for unknown expenses so that it&#39;s, it&#39;s, uh, accounted for in the budget.
Yeah. And this is not meant to replace something like QuickBooks. A there&#39;s definitely needs to be more accounting. That&#39;s a much more granular.
This is for making decisions and having a big picture idea of how much money&#39;s left. So if there&#39;s some expenses that are not, um, cannot be predicted having a line item here to capture that, that would, that should take care of us, uh, uh, that, that should help us, uh, make that decision.
Yeah. So it turns off, yeah, the, the, the runway, this is conflating is, uh, how much money has left is no money.
New money is coming in. So the assumption here is going to be, um, Chamberlain is committed to moving their entire institution over to us.
And as that progresses, there&#39;s a big BSN program that is supposed to come on to metrics. And that the goal is to extend the runway as long as possible, so that we allow for Chamberlain and also, um, for any other smaller contracts that we may sign between now.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/54a2eb5af5e74ca0b98310306d3a108d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Labs_Contacts General|CIENCE - Google Sheets - 1 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So overall, the big thing that I&#39;m noticing is, uh, we might be targeting too broad. So if we&#39;re looking at Harvard university as a whole, they&#39;re going to have deans for the entire school and maybe each of the different schools, each of the different cam colleges that within the school.
So we want to target specifically the medical school. So let&#39;s go to Google and Harvard school of medicine. Yeah. So here we can see the academic leadership for the medical school.
And then within the academic leadership, we can target, um, people that are involved with the clinical. It will be better since, uh, that&#39;s going to be more targeted at what we want to reach.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b44f2820ad7545b29a0898ef844a025b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>DC Budget Notes Aug 2022 - Google Docs - 1 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for these three, um, adjustments, it&#39;s going to be not a change in the total that was agreed to last a year.
This is essentially a increase in the cash component, so that less debt is added to a accounts payable. And yet the milestone has not been reached.
Um, this is, uh, based on our discussion with Chris and Rio about now needing a race. And, uh, um, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the re the agreement did state in there previously that we will make adjustments outside of the milestone if, uh, if possible.
And, uh, no, I have not. Uh, marina did have an adjustment, uh, earlier this year, I believe. Um, I have not spoken to greet a gay recently, right.
As a was earlier this year. Um, I believe, uh, we increased her to 35. Um, okay, so this is better.
And then for missing expenses, I will, um, have to add the sin. So for about these, uh, question and comments here, um, what I, so th this chart up here should show a real time change of any adjustments, or if there&#39;s, um, something that&#39;s not coming in, something has changed.
I can, can turn this on, turn this off. And the, for example, if something is delayed, I can adjust a date here.
And the numbers at the top would be, uh, would it have that reflected? And if there&#39;s any new, um, sales that are in the pipeline, I can put that in here and have it hidden.
So it doesn&#39;t get factored into the, uh, burn rate, um, and turn it on. And it also allows us to, if there&#39;s something that is coming in, uh, supposed to be coming in on nine one, but it doesn&#39;t actually get here until a month later, I can always adjust the dates based on that.
So, um, I do see it being, um, if there&#39;s no new money can expenses to be paid, um, and for how long that&#39;s this, this top information is showing real time, how much money is left based on the income and expenses and these dates, and when they&#39;re, uh, when they&#39;re coming in and as for the Mo for the, uh, beginning of each month, if there are expenses that was not included in this document, there&#39;s two ways that can be factored in one is to update that here and add that as a line item for that month and put it as one time payment.
Um, the other option is to have that, for example, this is a number 173,000. I put in 4, 7, 9. That was a bank balance at that time.
So if I change this at the beginning of each month to the bank balance, the rest of the calculation should be updated based on that date and the balance.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3c3e75a4b85e452e8075d4d94496ae7d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Runway | The Startup Cash Planning Tool by LTSE - 1 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, David. So for startup runway, once you log in, there&#39;s going to be a couple of scenarios. The first one, the metrics scenario is what I entered into the system from your spreadsheet, and it captures those numbers here.
And I made a copy of that called B2 for salary adjustments. And these are the adjustments that I&#39;ve made. And, um, this is based on my discussions with Chris and, uh, the approach here is, um, to anybody that was making less than 5,000, putting them into 5,000 and then across the board, giving everybody a 5% increase, uh, with the exception of David Ward, which, who got a 10% increase based on, uh, what felt Chris felt that, uh, um, he deserved it based on all the contributions he&#39;s been doing outside of his scope of work.
Um, and I agreed with that and for Tosh, well, myself, Chris and real, this is going to be the cash component of our compensation, not additional, uh, increases.
This is, uh, once this adjustment is made, it means that there&#39;s less debt getting added to the QuickBooks, um, accounts payable, accounts payable section.
And for, so the feedback that I need from you as I&#39;m looking at this budget and seeing any major gaps, for example, if there&#39;s any income that wasn&#39;t captured, any expenses that wasn&#39;t captured, or do you see any problems with anything incomes, our expenses, um, so that this can be appropriately, uh, finalized.
And the, the other thing that, um, One thing I did not include as any other, other debt payments, uh, besides Ben Franklin, Keith, and Mary, about, um, I was planning on taking out debt payments myself, but I&#39;m gonna hold off on it until we get through the science and then finalize the BSN contract.
We&#39;ll see you. So mainly it&#39;s going to be Ben Franklin Maribeth and Keith. And then, um, what I&#39;m also going to, um, Do is during the CU discussion, try to get a date on the CSBs and onboarding so that, that can also be capturing here.
So three key areas of a feedback, any major issues that are with the, with the, uh, income, anything that&#39;s missing, any major issues with the expenses, anything that&#39;s missing and then any general feedback, um, on the budget itself.
Um, so that, that can be incorporated. There&#39;s I know that there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s missing in here is novel and, uh, there&#39;s also, um, uh, conferences.
They need to be adjusted a little bit. So my way to account for that novel and, uh, marketing expenses is likely going to be me putting some more money into the company later in the year, if needed.
So I&#39;m taking this money out, but I&#39;m also saving that in case I need to put back into the business if there&#39;s any gaps.
So, um, so as of right now, I don&#39;t have a good mechanism to add novel into here. And, uh, for conferences, I put it at $2,500 per month.
Um, so I think that&#39;s going to be fine for the rest of this year, but for next year, we may need to adjust that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/051450fc260e426ba8c5e100f4f02b50</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Runway | The Startup Cash Planning Tool by LTSE - 1 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, David. So I know that you&#39;re tied up with the MSPE and, uh, probably have a little time. So I want to focus on the specific areas that you can look at.
Um, so the sort of one-way app is what I&#39;m using to update the budget. And so that I&#39;m going to hopefully use to maintain, uh, for, for the, for now the first, uh, when you log in, you&#39;re going to see a couple of scenarios at the top.
The base scenario is what came preloaded. You can ignore that the metrics one is the one I loaded using the spreadsheet and basically recreated the spreadsheet that you have.
Um, pull the numbers from there. It has expenses, income, and, uh, for the financing I pulled, I started entering this data on 7, 9, 20 22.
And on that day we had $173,000 in the bank. And that&#39;s why it starting with that. So the calculations should be based on that date and the dates, these things are coming out.
So if it&#39;s set for yearly, it should come out on that day. So, so this is the current budget. And what I did was made a copy of this for salary adjustments, and this will have salary adjustments here.
And the logic behind these adjustments is anybody that is, was making less than 5,000, um, putting them to 5,000 and then across the board, giving everybody a 5% bump.
And the, I don&#39;t know if, uh, these payments in, in the spreadsheet that you had was a salary plus insurance reimbursement or how that was factored in.
Uh, I&#39;m assuming that a number in there includes bolt. So this number should also include bolt if that was the case.
Um, and then for David Ward, there&#39;s an exception here. I, I, we did a 10% increase. Um, uh, Craig, Chris also felt that, um, he deserved a, uh, extra bump given his involvement in different areas of the business.
And, uh, for Chris de Rio and myself, this adjustment is not a, uh, additional increase on top of our previously discussed, uh, increase.
This is simply, uh, increasing our cash component. So the debt component is decreasing. Um, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the salary increases.
Um, and then for other expenses and income, he can review that. So the feedback that I need is, do you see any major items missing from here in terms of income and expenses, and then for the, um, a couple of things that Chris pointed out is, um, the LMU has not been finalized.
So I took that out and for this, uh, CU one, um, I have it in here as a hundred thousand, given current negotiations.
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s going to be less. And then for, um, another thing that he had pointed out with, yeah, for science, I have it in here as a one-time payment instead of a monthly payment with the assumption that, um, if we&#39;re not generating new leads, we may stop at the end of three months.
Um, however, that will need to be reassessed later that I can add back on as a monthly payment, if necessary.
So that&#39;s under science here. I also need to make some changes to the conferences and, um, also need to add novel in here somehow.
So anyway, so as of right now, um, February 20, 23 is six months runway and I&#39;m not factoring in my payment.
So for next, uh, for.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ffeb21a44eb64650910a3bc1a9914d88</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Whether it be medical students, nursing students, or vet students, they all have to track patient logs and procedure logs.

And what are the diagnosis that I saw metrics allows them to have a, all those requirements clearly defined, uh, with the minimum that&#39;s required, all the procedures that they have to complete as part of training, but minimums.
And then students can go in there, log the procedure and send it to a supervisor for approval. So there&#39;s a documented record of the patients and procedures that they did as part of training.
And once they complete the minimum numbers required, then they pull filled the requirements for that, that, that diagnosis. So essentially, um, in terms of value that we are providing, actually I see the pain points is, um, we can ask the, to the, uh, the, the contact there.
Um, how are you tracking the cases that students see at their clinical rotations? Is there a centralized way to track how many, uh, of certain diagnosis state they saw and if they don&#39;t have that, we can mention that, uh, you know, how are you, um, ensuring that the students are seeing a adequate number of patients before they graduate, if they&#39;re not tracking it.
Um, and if they, if they are tracking it, we want us, uh, ask them, do you have, do the students have visibility into what they need to complete and what they have already completed?
Because other systems typically don&#39;t provide that information with metrics you can, as a student, I can always see a dashboard and I can see that for my pediatric rotation.
For example, I have this many diagnosis that I&#39;ve already seen and this many have remaining, so I can always work towards completing my goals.
And we also have a simple mobile UI that they can use to enter all this information. And, uh, on the institutional level, they can also have reports that show, um, what the students are completed.
Uh, and, and, uh, before they graduate.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/455c99e6804142a6a194e662757f0193</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Modules and MSPE Breakdown - Google Docs - 29 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So solution for schools. Let me, uh, let&#39;s start with an overview or view as medical schools, nursing schools and vet schools all have two types of training that they provide.
First is the classroom-based training, where they are learning anatomy, biochemistry, and other basic sciences. And then the second part of training is going out to hospitals and clinics to work directly with patients under the supervision of a mentor, which is referred to as a preceptor.
And when it comes to metrics, we provide two types of clinical scheduling tools. First is the block schedule, which allows them to schedule students into blocks of time, which is typically four to six weeks at a time in each hospital or each department within a hospital.
And the shift schedule, which is for daily assignments, if they are doing, let&#39;s say an on-call schedule, a shift from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, they can actually put the student into a daily assignment.
This is less, uh, less important, important for our schools. They typically using only block schedules, but we have the capacity if they want to use it.
Um, when approaching the institutional readership, what we want to bring up is pain points or, uh, questions to ask. Um, how are you coordinating the schedules of students that are going out to different hospitals and clinics?
Do you have a tool that is used to manage the, uh, schedules as well as the capacity at each of these, uh, clinical sites?
Um, because the schools have to collect the availability of the preceptors and the, uh, the, the, the rotations so that they can schedule appropriately.
If you don&#39;t have a preceptor available, then you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t schedule that. So how are you coordinating this is done using spreadsheet.
If so, how much time is that? Are you frustrated with the amount of time it takes to do that? Um, you know, there&#39;s a better way for us to that so that you can, we can start to introduce metrics.
Uh, we can do the scheduling as well as, uh, enable the different hospitals or clinics that they work with to log in and see real-time availability of, uh, students.
And when those students will be coming to those hospitals to, uh, for their rotations. So we solve the, the scheduling aspect of it, eliminating all the spreadsheets.
And then we also, um, provide visibility into the schedules in real-time so that the students, the hospitals and the administrators are looking at the same data at all times.
Um, because spreadsheets in an email does not provide data and essentially it, um, cuts down the administrative burden for these coordinators, uh, significantly and equally important is the student frustration.
If they are looking at an outdated schedule and then go to the wrong hospital, wrong site, that&#39;s, that&#39;s a lot of frustration and wasted time for the student having this information in their calendar.
And it syncs with their, their Google or apple calendars. They can always know where they, they need to be. Um, so they can focus on the training and not trying to figure out administrative work.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ab5478e973a8469692947628a84ef8f6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Modules and MSPE Breakdown - Google Docs - 29 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for clinical schedules, first, an overview, when a student is going through a training, whether it be a med student, a nursing student or vet school, they spend half of their time in classrooms.
And then the other half in different hospitals and clinics getting trained in different areas of medicine or healthcare. And these are typically scheduled in four to six week intervals.
And each four weeks, they switch from one department to the other in the hospital or one hospital to another. So this requires a lot of coordination and this is done using spreadsheets and other, um, methodology that is not efficient.
And when we talk to these institutions, the pain points that we can address is, um, are you, how are you currently managing the, your clinical schedules or clerkship schedules?
So the language here is if we use clinical schedules, we can kind of use that across the board. We&#39;re speaking specifically to medical school.
We may want to use clerkship or you&#39;re managing your clerkship schedules and you have a software in place for that.
Um, and the other thing that we can ask is, um, do your, do you have a process for collecting availability, um, off preceptors and, um, number of students, a student capacity from these sites?
So I&#39;m a medical school I&#39;m running.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cab68608cd804826bdf58c08c3b538d6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, this is a task based on the Montefiore implementation. They&#39;re going to be using projects heavily, and I want to us to try and make some usability improvements to make, make it easier for the residents to do some stuff.
Overall, it&#39;s really big enhancement that we did and it&#39;s working well. These are some smaller things that we need to, uh, clean up.
Uh, first thing here on the program projects. Um, what we want to do is, um, choose incomplete as a default status.
So we&#39;re not seeing everything. If something&#39;s already competed, it doesn&#39;t have to be on the screen all the time. The other thing is, um, if I&#39;m on the projects program projects page, this dropdown doesn&#39;t need to be here since I am a program admin.
I shouldn&#39;t, um, actually I take that back. What we need to do is make sure that this dropdown all these shows active programs.
So right now it&#39;s, it&#39;s showing, um, many items in here, for example, general surgery, critical deficiencies. They don&#39;t show up in here and we want to make sure that this has all been showing active programs.
Then when we come down to the actual projects themselves, we have the edit button and we have the view button, which is fine and it&#39;s working well.
Um, what we want to do is if someone is viewed, just viewing the project, we don&#39;t want to reveal the documents that are attached to this, uh, project.
So the document should not be visible because anybody can view a project and we don&#39;t want to accidentally leak some sensitive documents.
And the other thing is a task, um, window here, what we, when you&#39;re looking at a project task, we have the section at the top where we&#39;re showing project details.
It will be good for us to include all of these items at the top. We can clean this up so that it looks more concise.
And so that if I&#39;m looking at project tasks, I can also see the project details. And, uh, we can, the, the overview section here make it long.
They may have a very long description of several paragraphs. What we can do there is to make it collapsible. So similar to the way that we do on the, um, evaluations assignments page, we have an accordion that we can use to expand it and the documents we can show in a table so that it lists out the document name with a download button and a way to, um, um, the way to open up the documents in a, um, PDF viewer.
And then when it comes to the actual tasks themselves, um, we can, so this small field here is kind of a, it doesn&#39;t draw attention to it when you&#39;re ready to create a new task.
It&#39;d be nice if we can put this, um, into, Um, into the top with its own card so that it stands out and with the heading that does add new task and this field, um, and then also include a way to assign a deadline and assigned to someone when you&#39;re creating the task.
Um, So that way it&#39;s a, it&#39;s something that they can do in one shot. Um, so, and then when we&#39;re clicking on this, um, comments, it slides open, um, and you know, comments and files on the right side.
Um, so it would be good if we can, uh, what we need to do here is if I&#39;m adding a comment, I can, I can no longer edit it.
So we want to do is add a little edit and delete button so that if I&#39;m the author of this comment, I can come back here and edit it or delete it if I&#39;m adding a file, add file.
Same thing. What I want to do is have a, um, first I want to have a download icon and they, um, delete icon with a sweet alert that it brings up.
Are you sure you want to remove this, this, uh, file. Okay. And I think the other thing that would be helpful is, um, when you&#39;re looking at a particular project and you&#39;re expanding, it&#39;d be nice if we do something like this, where, um, we could have it stand out a little bit more so you can see here, I could tasks and I have three tasks here.
It&#39;s not really clear that this belongs to this project, this particular task, unless I&#39;m like hovering over it and things are showing it, instead of doing this, it would be nice if we eliminate these gray boxes that are coming up and simply use this regular table.
And then when you click on a comment or a file, it slides open similar to the way it does on the users feel.
And then it&#39;s clear that these things belong together right now. It doesn&#39;t look all these gray boxes that it doesn&#39;t really make that clear.
So please let me know if you have any questions and kind of dives, the, uh, the, uh, the bird in the background.

So I&#39;d like to do is, um, here, um, replaced this attachments, um, section here with two icons, one to download and one to view.
And if I click on view, it&#39;ll open up a model. I mean, even if it&#39;ll open up the PDF viewer, similar to the way that it looks like in resources, and we also want to apply the same thing here.
If I go in here and search for a session, It&#39;s going to show a instructional methods and resources here. And if I have an attachment at the bottom, I would want to use the view and download icons for that same thing on the content under actions, add a view button so that we can open up the, a plugin to view the PDF.

We have the ability to add files to the content section. You can add files as instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources.
So if I have this and let me see if I can find a PDF save and you can see here, if I click this, it&#39;ll open up in the page.
Um, this is my car bill. Essentially, what we want to do is, um, make it so that I&#39;m looking at us a attachment here.
We want to add a little download icon. We can take that from This download button here and also show a view button so that it shows the same view of is here.
So if I&#39;m adding a resource assessment method or instructional method shows two icons, one for viewing and one for downloading, and if it&#39;s clicked, if, as a viewer, it opens up in that same viewer that we use for resources, and we would want to apply this to every page.
We&#39;re showing that the session. So on the search page, we have sessions showing up here as a download button here, um, on the attachment here.
So what we&#39;d like to do is, um, I had two icons here, one for download and one for one for a viewing and the same thing on the calendar view.

So we have this meeting with David and Chris today to go into the MSPE and get some, might get some insight into some of the decisions that were made and what led to some of the challenges that we&#39;re having now.
And for me personally, this is not a mystery I already know, based on our prior history, what, um, when wrong.
And, uh, I want to give you an overview of the, uh, the background of the MSP and some of the communication challenges that we had, and what I believe is probably the cause of this and this, it has to do with my communication style.
Um, so first starting off with the MSPE, this is a large project that started months ago. Initially my plan was to hand this off to the, the team to build this module and work on it little by little over time and get it done.
However, after several weeks I saw that there were, the team was meeting and discussing things, but there was no concrete tasks created no documentation.
I mean, no specs on design design. So I decided that this was a project that I was going to lead, and I decided to, uh, pull marina in from Brazil as the, uh, the lead developer on this module.
So once that decision was made, um, the, uh, there was some frustration with the team and the, they felt that, you know, it was not something that we could do in time because, uh, um, it was a very complex feature.
And, uh, that, that the team&#39;s recommendation was that we do it as a, uh, backend tool that generates a bunch of charts, but not necessarily have an interface for the plot client.
I disagreed with this. Cause I, I feel that this is an important module that we need to productize and sell.
And I also spoke to marina and she said that this is something that can be built and she felt confident she can do it.
So anyway, so I, I wrote the specs and designs for the earlier tasks and my approach for building specs and design is usually I start off, you know, thinking about it for a few days and eventually put together a mock-up.
And what I communicated with the team is, you know, if you&#39;re a developer, you may not need a mock-up Harbor people in order to discuss this in a meeting or group, uh, with a client and a visual helps everyone understand what the project is.
So, um, this is an, I always liked to do so I presented this to the team, the entire company got their feedback, and then I started writing specs.
So for every single module, a component or story that was built for this MSP, um, like I typically plan it, mock it up.
And then in a meeting, discuss it with the team. Sometimes I even met with one-on-one with different individuals to gather feedback and adjust the specs accordingly.
So I, this was something that marina led the development. I did the planning and I also pulled in Mike to do a higher high quality design based on my mock-ups.
Um, and I got through most of it by the time it got to the last, uh, chart, um, our baby was born.
So I ended up taking a week and a half off at this point, um, is when the project was handed to David to take over, uh, since the deadline was approaching in a month.
So he started working on it and with Chris. So, um, we were having weekly, I think, not weekly or biweekly meetings with the client on this project.
And initially when I was working on this, I joined the first few calls. And after that, I noticed that Chris was leading the discussion.
So let them handle it with David. And then when I came back from, uh, my time off and join one of the calls, I noticed that David was leaving the discussion.
Uh, this is something I&#39;ve never seen before. It was something that Chris has always led these discussions, but for some reason it got passed the David and, uh, I don&#39;t think he should have been doing that because these are, um, this is something that I feel like David has a hard time saying no to things and pushing back on the client.
And, uh, that&#39;s something that, um, uh, I made a mistake there. I should have intervened there. Um, but I didn&#39;t and, uh, they continue to have the meetings and I let the project run.
Um, so the, um, so that actually that&#39;s, uh, that was an area that I, I probably could have helped. Um, and I asked, I could have asked, uh, why, uh, David wasn&#39;t leading those meetings.
Anyway, part of the reason I, I didn&#39;t intervene at that point is, um, David feels very comfortable working with Chris and he&#39;s really the only person that he works with.
And sometimes when I question why he&#39;s doing certain things, he gets upset. So that&#39;s one of the reasons why I said, um, they can just continue working on it.
Anyway, continue. Uh, after we, um, after this, this, uh, project was tended to David and Chris, I had zero visibility into it.
I was removed from all the emails. Um, they were meeting every meeting. One-on-one all discussions Took place in direct messages in slack.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8dc9add3434c4494a1d12d845f94560f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE Plan - Google Docs - 25 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, mark. We have this meeting today to review the MSPE with Chris and David. I want you to lead this discussion today and, um, I want to send you this video in advance because, uh, as I&#39;d rather provide this context outside of the meeting, because I don&#39;t want this to, uh, um, be, uh, a bad meeting.
And I feel like it&#39;s something that, uh, there is a lot of frustration with, uh, David and I&#39;ve also frustrated about a couple of things.
I don&#39;t want to share that with you, what I&#39;m not interested in, in, uh, in blaming placing blame on anyone.
I simply want to us to get better at what we&#39;re doing. Um, at the same time, it&#39;s also important for me to communicate my frustration with you, especially if you&#39;re going to be leaving the product management.
Um, so I don&#39;t really have any missed, I don&#39;t have a mystery or there is no mystery as to what went wrong.
I, this is something that we had challenges in the past and from my understanding of the team and prior history, what went wrong here is poor communication.
And, um, and, uh, this is something I feel like it&#39;s is, is a problem between the communication styles of myself and David.
For some reason, um, David Ali feels comfortable working with Chris. And this is Chris is the one that initially met David and they had formed a friendship before even metrics.
Uh, he joined metrics. So David only feels comfortable working with Tim and even Rio he gets frustrated with and gets angry with.
Um, so this I&#39;ve studied this myself and trying to figure out a solution for this and an advisor pointed to me this, uh, this, this, um, disc communication styles.
And I feel like this is probably a good explanation for what&#39;s going on. Um, I like I&#39;ve taken this test and I feel like I have the Eagle communication style and I&#39;m very direct.
And, and, uh, and I feel like, um, he, David is a, an owl conscientious communication style, and both of us are very different.
And for some reason I have not been able to adapt my communication styles to connect with them, and he has not been able to adapt his style to connect with me.
So typically what happens is when there is a project that is handed off to David, he goes into a, um, well, it&#39;s not just him, Chris and David goes into a silo And everything is completely, uh, cut off from the rest of the team.
And in this case, when Matt MSPE started for the first few months, I was leading this project, uh, planning out the feature, architecting the different, uh, functionality, and then, uh, having marina as the lead developer on this.
And I worked on all of these tasks and we got like some of the complex functionality that, uh, we had to build was, uh, you know, building these charts and dynamically generating them.
Marina built all of this, uh, with, from the specs that I gave her. And when our kid was born, I took a week and a half off and I was passed the project over to David.
Um, and Chris. So Chris was meeting with the clients every couple of weeks to get an up, uh, for a product update.
And then I think after David took over, he started leading that meeting. Uh, that meeting should not have been past the David.
Um, this is something that Chris and I talked about and he agrees that was a mistake, uh, because David does not have any experience or negotiating with clients about these kinds of things.
Um, he&#39;s a very nice guy and he likes to help. So clients will ask them to do things and he will agree to do it.
Um, Chris and I usually will push back if there&#39;s something that we sh that should not be on our side.
Um, so I think that was problem. Number one, problem. Number two is that this silo that happens with David and Chris, where all communication goes to, uh, with them in a, in a private messages on slack or calls private one-on-one calls instead of using the shared channels.
So this was a channel that I started for this project and I use for working with Marino. So David and Chris only use this channel to share periodic updates and to talk to marina about her task, everything, anything David was working on was, was, uh, there was no specs.
There was no, uh, notes on what was going to be built and no group discussion on what the best strategy for it.
So the earlier parts of the module we met as a team, I got gathered feedback from everybody and adapt, adapt to the, uh, the functionalities to based on their feedback.
Once it was handed off to Chris and David, and it was one-on-one and talking on a call and building it, um, I feel that is a big problem and I no longer want to continue that method with anybody else.
Uh, because this, um, this, uh, siloed communication leads to a lot of problems and frustration. So, um, the, uh, there&#39;s two pieces of information that I could have helped with if I was kept in the loop one, uh, this module was initially, um, negotiated with the Talem.
I negotiated this whole contract. And the commitment that we made was to build the feature that will generate the document.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/49b21d3f022741b28a3c4e3cad23a3ec</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE Plan - Google Docs - 25 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, I&#39;m mark.

Look at this. Um, I want to share my perspective. Um, and I, after working with the Dean for past four years, you know, this is something that has happened several times and, um, I want to, so there&#39;s not really much of a mystery here, um, as opposed to, uh, as to what happened.
Um, and, um, I want to explain this to you because, um, so you have context and I also wanted to give this to you.
Um, so that during the meeting, I&#39;m not going to go into all the details cause it&#39;s not important. Um, the, um, over the past four months we&#39;ve been working on this module, which is essentially the largest, one of the, uh, I would say the largest, one of the largest modules that we have built.
And this is also something that is critical for the future. And, um, initially when we started this project, um, this was something that we were going to work on as a team.
And I, I was hoping that other team members would take the lead on this. And what I saw happening was similar to in the past, um, there was calls being held where things were discussed about what needs to be built at the same time, no real design or plan plans were being put together.
So what I did was I asked, I said, why don&#39;t the rest of the team focus on what&#39;s happening for the clients?
And I pulled marina, who was our team member in Brazil. And I said, I&#39;m going to get started on this since, uh, this is something that she&#39;s able to handle she&#39;s free.
Um, so I started writing specs and planning out each of these different tasks. Um, this includes researching and for each of these things, the way that I like to work is I do the plan.
I think about what&#39;s the best way to architect the solution, thinking about all the current modules that we have, I sketch out a framework in a Figma.
Um, so let&#39;s see this one for us from, He can see here. Yeah. I mean, I, I started working on this actually eight months ago.
Um, but anyway, so I started with some basic overview of what new we need to build. I held him, I pulled all the team members together and Chris David Creo, Mike, um, Maria, um, and presented this to the team and got some feedback.
Um, and essentially everybody, um, what sort of the, my mindset that it&#39;s too big of a module to finish in time and we shouldn&#39;t build, um, interface.
We should simply have a tool that works behind the scenes and, and generate the charts. Um, I, I felt strongly that this was something that we needed to turn into a product so that we can use it for other institutions.
So, um, marina also felt confident that she can build it. So we went through the next couple of months building each of the different charts, um, each of the different, uh, type of customers&#39; fields.
And, and, um, towards the end of that&#39;s what actually towards the middle of June, um, I took, uh, about a week and a half off after our, uh, our baby was born.
And during this time I sort of, uh, handed this off to David and Chris who have already been meeting with the client.
Um, and they started working on the rest of the functionality. So when we initially designed the scope of this with the client, the plan was to deliver a module that generates these charts and generates the document.
And what we had agreed on was the student review of the chart was an optional functionality. And I had also met with the team and, um, individually with key team members and set and went over this plan.
Um, so what happened after I took the time off was I went, everything went dark. It was simply Chris and David working together on this module.
There was zero communication outside of that, except me. And, you know, the emails where, uh, with the client was between Chris David and, and, uh, directly emailing them.
The discussions were on, uh, direct messages in slack. And the only real communication, uh, was a couple of, uh, messages directly to marina or these summary updates.
So what I felt was the, um, the problem that, and the reason That ended up in this situation, uh, where David is very overwhelmed is because we did not operate as a team and utilize a different skill sets.
So MSPE is a very complex document that has put together for medical schools. And, um, it requires a lot of knowledge about how these data&#39;s come put together and what those information means.
And when it comes to working with this particular client, um, we should not have taken on the additional work of creating their data in the system.
Uh, we should have simply created a import import tools for them to load the data like we had done in the past.
Um, so that decision to take on that data component was not discussed with me. And it was something that, um, if, if, um, I have made aware of it, I would have said, no.
I mean, we typically review the datas as just to provide feedback, but we don&#39;t really clean up data. We don&#39;t, that&#39;s not something that we should never taken on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/193876bf0c8447feb932e4ef25bbc492</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Intro to Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hello. I wanted to, uh, use this video to provide a general overview of metrics and the market so that as you&#39;re getting familiar with metrics as a company, you have some background context on how we operate and the type of clients that we serve.
So this is not meant to be a, a thorough video of everything that we do, but just to set the framework so that more information can be built on this over the next few weeks.
So starting with a website here, you can see on the right on the homepage, we have this section here that shows a different market segments that we serve, um, metrics as a company, we&#39;re a B2B business where we provide a SAS platform for managing healthcare education.
And I&#39;m going to get into the details of, uh, the specific type of education we manage. But this homepage gives you a quick snapshot, undergraduate medical education, which in which is a essentially medical schools, graduate medical education, which is after medical school with residency and fellowship nursing, allied health.
And we haven&#39;t really tapped into the clinical practice yet. This is something that we are putting it up on the website as an area that we can serve.
This is, uh, for future growth. And there&#39;s some more details that you can see if you go into the specific areas, but I&#39;m gonna go back to this, uh, slides here.
So our vision is to create an all-in-one enterprise level platform for healthcare education, uh, for students and workers. And we specifically, uh, include a few words here.
One is the all-in-one we&#39;ve been trying to create a platform that can essentially do end to end education management. And there are products in the market that target specific areas, such as scheduling or performance evaluations or curriculum.
We try to create a all-in-one solution that institutions can manage all of their, all their data needs. The other area here is the students and the workers.
Um, so we specifically mentioned students because other platforms are heavily focused on the administrators. We, on the other hand, having trying to focus our attention more on the end users, which are the trainees and the faculty, um, who are in charge of training them.
So the broader way to look at it as learners and educators. So we want to make sure those individuals are taken care of because if they&#39;re using the platform and they&#39;re happy, then the administrators are also going to be happy because they they&#39;ll receive the data that they need.
It&#39;s like a metrics is a SAS platform and it is offered institutions as a annual subscription. And we price the platform based on the number of trainees they have.
So if a hospital or medical school comes to us, we look at the program over the number of enrolled students and come up with the price based on that.
And the administrators and faculty members for preceptors are the individuals that support the trainees. Can we add it at no additional cost?
And, um, again, we have two client types, one universities, which, um, host different types of training programs, such as medical schools, and other way to medical schools are called as graduate undergraduate medical education.
So again, we, the word undergraduate here is talking about the medical schools. The individuals that are in a medical school are working towards a doctorate doctorate degree, which is the MD degree or the Dio degree.
They have already finished the bachelors undergraduate degree education and are in a, uh, before they even got into the medical school.
Few of our clients that are medical schools include a Michigan state Ross university and the, um, Barbados and American university of the Caribbean nursing schools.
They, um, span from bachelor&#39;s to doctorate, to master&#39;s or doctorate. So you can do a BSN degree in nursing, and then you can take an exam to get your RN.
You can then advance into a master&#39;s program, which is called the MSN degree. And if you get your license there and you, uh, do additional clinical experience, you will get your nurse practitioner degree, and there are different tracks you can go into for nurse practitioner.
And then if you go further, you can receive your, um, the, uh, there&#39;s specialized Strikeforce CRNs, which are near nurse nursing nest.
This is a nest diocese. Um, then there&#39;s also the DNP program, which is doctorate in nurse nursing education. So nursing gets a little complicated, we&#39;ll get into it later, but our Chamberlain university school of nursing is the largest nursing school in the United States.
And we are in the process of migrating all of their training programs over to us. And we&#39;ll have the full range of the different training programs and metrics.
Allied health is, uh, is basically an umbrella, uh, uh, vertical, where it had contains several types of training programs and good way to look at it as a, basically anybody that supports, um, other areas of healthcare besides the physicians and nurses.
And So you can see eye health, you can see there&#39;s various types of training programs here, and I&#39;m going to take this link here and put this year.
We have, um, mark Merck, sorry. Mercy university has physical therapy and Ross university school of veterinary medicine is one of our other clients.
Um, so hospital Constables are the other big bucket of clients that we have. And essentially healthcare education is composed of half classroom-based training in universities, and then apprentice training model in hospitals.
So where you&#39;re taking care of patients and you&#39;re working under an experienced educator and hospitals can host their own programs.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/92ddf406da974953abb9417eb1b0cd0f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Group/Pod OMS 1 - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 22 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey David. So they create these groups from, um, the pods that they created. So first they would break all the students into these pods that contain four students each and for each course, each type of LEC lecture or lab, they would create, um, a set of groups that contain several pods.
And for each of the courses, it, the number of pods that are included for the group, maybe different. And within a course, also they may have labs that have a different set of pods, um, based on when the labs are offered.
So the tags, functionality and metrics was created so that we can put, categorize a bunch of groups together. So not when I say the word group in metrics.
Um, what I mean is our groups. When I talk about the MSU pods, we&#39;re going to be, uh, we want to want to be treat those as our groups, cause that&#39;s the most granular, um, uh, bucket of students that we have.
And then we&#39;re going to take several buckets together and create a MSU group. Since we don&#39;t have a way to create a group of groups in metrics, we created a tags functionality by tagging several pods together.
Then that becomes, um, a, a group of groups and in metrics, in different parts of the system, we are starting to use the tags, um, to select these, um, these, these, uh, groups of groups.
And then I&#39;ll show you an example. Let me see if I can find a course evaluation here. So you can see here that you can select individual groups one by one, or you can select group tags.
So if you select a tag, then all groups that belong to that tag will be included. So if we create all of their pods as groups, whenever we need to select a bunch of these groups in and, uh, in as a batch, you can simply select the attack.
So the advantage of doing it this way is when you&#39;re doing a session schedule, you have to, they&#39;re going to be putting, um, a bunch of pods into a session schedule based on the lab or lecture that&#39;s happening.
If we have separate pods for each, each group in metrics, then they would have to select each pod one by one for every single session.
But if we let them select a tag that includes multiple pods, then they only have to select one tag. And then all the other pods that belong to that tag will be selected.
So it saves them a lot of clicking. And if they&#39;re using an import to get this into the system, we can simply add a column called group tag.
And when the import happens, every group that is tagged with that tag will be selected for that schedule.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e41ea4392ed840ae9bc2436077287345</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Purdue UME Proposal.docx - Google Docs - 22 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So for this, um, uh, LME proposal, what we need to do is make some tweaks to match what I sent to Purdue.
Um, you can see it lists out the different modules and I believe you made the top part. Then I just, the bottom bottom part, um, they need the same modules as LMU.
And in addition to the ones that we have here, actually they need evaluations, case and tendencies. They don&#39;t need, um, curriculum mapping.
Um, they do need clinical schedules, resources, case logs portfolios. Um, Let&#39;s See so many or all of these. And then we&#39;re also going to add on work hours and that&#39;ll be an extra $10 per year per student.
So that&#39;s going to be work hours. And I think that&#39;s it. And then we also want to create a, a section right after this.
That is for any custom development work that we&#39;re committing to. The first one is the sites, uh, demographic fields, and the ability to attract those demographic feels there&#39;s going to be, um, the optimizer and, um, the site demographic fields it&#39;s already included.
We&#39;re going to knock charging for that optimizer. We&#39;re going to be charging separately based on once we get the requirements.
And then here we can add four modules included, confirmed that this matches what&#39;s on top and add work hours and that it becomes 1 35.
Um, and then for optimizer service, um, this is what I sent to a Purdue. We can do the same thing here.
LMU does not need a curriculum and for implementation, this can be five. Well, I have a comment here. Okay. And then the other thing that he asked for is the migration of data from current platform.
Let&#39;s see. Yeah. And then for the customer development or setup, we can include SSO as included. So the second section you&#39;re creating is going to have, um, a few items in it versus going to be the site demographic fields, which is included optimizer, which is going to be a one-time fee for development.
There&#39;s going to be SSL, which is included, and you can check your notes if there&#39;s anything else that we committed to adding during this mock implementation and for, um, migration of the existing, uh, data, uh, from evalu, what we can tell them is this is something that will be a one-time fee.
Um, we will need to review the data to assess how much work is involved and then how the work will be split between us and the institution, whether there&#39;ll be formatting the data for us, um, for us to be able to import it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a37bc6b5008341b29e6fdcedc17083cc</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Heron and Emily hope you&#39;re doing well. So going over these questions, those are the first one. Um, this student is having an error on this page, the view user profile, uh it&#39;s because on the about me page somehow, uh, the user was able to save, um, some text formatting that is not supported by the system and the th they didn&#39;t do anything wrong.
They probably copied and pasted or something in there. And we are clearing that out. And we&#39;re also adding an update to that field, so that if someone accidentally add some formatting, it will be removed automatically when the page saves.
So it doesn&#39;t happen again. So it&#39;s something that we&#39;ll update soon for the second one. So the reason why you&#39;re having a difficulty saving that, um, second rotation is because there seems to be an issue on that page, that we were able to identify that if you have a rotation that, um, that you&#39;re saving, and it shows the alert that says there&#39;s going to be an overlap with another rotation, and it doesn&#39;t save, uh, we&#39;re going to be fixing that shortly.
Um, in the meantime, what you can do is delete the first rotation. So delete the psychiatry rotation and then add the pediatric rotation as a new entry.
So instead of editing psychiatry to, and changing it to pediatrics, delete it and then add it, and then it should save for this third one.
It looks like these curriculum rotations were set up, um, during the last academic period when we did the migration. And what we need to do now is do a migration from the lax last academic period to the new academic period.
So this may take us a little while to coordinate this. I I&#39;ll reach out to, um, uh, Jessica, uh, Jessica wicks and see if we&#39;re ready to do that.
And once that&#39;s moved over, you&#39;ll have a copy of the curriculum in the 2022 to 2023 academic period. Um, so for Emily, your questions for all students that have an image in their account, they can click on their profile by either clicking on their name and going to the profile page, or my profile on the left side, and their photo will appear here and they can right click on the image and save it if they want to save it, it&#39;s already going to be available.
Um, the second option is to add it as a file in the documents and certifications, um, that will show up here.
But, um, so let&#39;s see. So you have the student with a profile. So let me just edit here. So you can see if you download it, you can do a save image as, and they can, they can save that image.
Um, so that&#39;s one way they can get it. And the second way is under, under the profile, there&#39;s a document and certifications section.
And if you want us to add a document type called professional photo, so you can upload it here, that&#39;s another possibility.
Uh, my recommendation is get it into the system so that it shows up on their profile. And if they want to, they can always download it from there by right.
Clicking on it. I think it&#39;ll be, um, that&#39;s the first step. And if you want to do some more additional work and have a second copy under documents certification, you can always do that to let us know if we want us to create a category called professional photo for that purpose For evaluations.
Um, our evaluation reports are at least for the summary report is based on submission. I&#39;m sorry, the assignment date, and the reason we use assignment date for this is, uh, sometimes evaluations are submitted late and you don&#39;t always know when something has been submitted or not.
So if we do the assignment date, then we know if we want to pick up evaluations for a certain rotations, you always choose to rotation date range, and it&#39;ll pull up all the ones that were assigned, um, as long as it&#39;s been submitted, but it for submission date, if someone submitted it three or four weeks later, then we may not be able to capture that accurately.
That&#39;s why we have made this filter using assignment date. If you want to view the, um, submission data, it will be under evaluations assignments and okay.
We don&#39;t have anything in the system right now. Let me see if I can pull it on a demo server.
I go to the, uh, evaluations and assignments page here. You can see, um, if I had to choose a wider date range, so you can notice that this one was submitted and it shows the assignment date.
And, um, actually this one doesn&#39;t show submitted because it&#39;s a confidential form, Maybe. Yeah. Well, I don&#39;t have an example for that on this demo server.
Um, you could see that the assignment station up here, here, and the submission date appears here. So this is one place that you can see where it&#39;s submitted, but the actual reports itself are based on the assignment date.
Um, and it was done intentionally so that you&#39;re able to pick up evaluations, um, based on when days when it went out.
And it&#39;s the context of the rotation. So the, that the results are not affected by, um, someone submitting it late So when it comes to, um, a stop gap solution, uh, this is something that will require more, um, of a process on the FileMaker side.
And I&#39;ll have to check with the team on what progress has been made on setting that up with metrics. So on a evaluation form, once it&#39;s been submitted, there is a way to submit a review.
So if you click here and click and submit a review, um, so this can be a way for you to look at each form and submit a review and acknowledge that it&#39;s been looked at.
And if FileMaker is pulling in every review date, that information can be used to sign off that your, the clerkship team actually looked at it.
Let me just confirm that this is a, what are you looking to accomplish here? Yeah, so I think it&#39;s best for us to talk about this, uh, in our next meeting, um, So that we can see what&#39;s happening with these comments.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f82e28c0fb6b479e8f13001cd93eee23</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Erin&#39;s Questions</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Erin, for these questions that you have for the first one, um, we looked into it and it looks like the about me page on the students&#39; profiles.
Um, if the student apps, any spot formatting like line breaks, it looked, it caused a problem with the page and it was preventing it from displaying.
So this individual student we cleared up and they formatting on there and then it should be working at working properly.
Uh, we&#39;re also adding a small update to that page. So if a student adds formatting to the text, they&#39;re entered putting into the about me page.
Um, it will clear that when they&#39;re saving, uh, the field, so it doesn&#39;t cause any problems. So in the short term, we cleared it out and well, the next few days we&#39;ll be adding a small update that will prevent this from happening again.
Um, same similar thing issue here with the schedule when the schedule is being edited. And it has an alert that pops up that says there&#39;s an overlap with another assignment.
Um, it&#39;s preventing it from being saved. So if we have a situation where the rotation is overlapping, this something else, and an alert pops up, um, the best approach there is to delete the first assignment or delete psychiatry and then create the new rotation after the first one is deleted, and this is a temporary solution.
We&#39;re going to be adding in small update there so that if you need to edit it, it doesn&#39;t give you this problem.
So in the future, you&#39;ll be able to edit and create the new rotation, uh, in one step, uh, for now you can delete the psychiatry rotation and then add the pediatrics one separately for this third one about a curriculum we&#39;ll need to move the curriculum from the last academic year to the current academic year.
Um, so I&#39;ll reach out to Jessica wicks and see if this is something that we&#39;re ready to do. And if so, we&#39;ll work with her on rolling that over.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7a7366d2813d4ac684ece454c739c309</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Purdue UME Proposal.docx - Google Docs - 22 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>All right. So this is the LMU proposal that we sent to them. This is the Purdue one that I sent like this week.
And essentially what we&#39;re going to do is make a copy of this and, um, modify it. So that includes the same modules, plus the work hours modules, and then also remove the curriculum, um, add work hours, but also be nice if we can put this in some sort of a foreigner like alphabetical order so that it looks intentional kind of all over the place right now.
And then down here in terms of pricing, we&#39;re going to be adding, um, going to be adding up 10. This was what we sent to Purdue, but we&#39;re going to adding 10 more dollars per student for the work hours module.
That&#39;ll make it 1 35 per student, the custom optimizer. I put it as a development fee and then one time, I mean, one time he development.
And then for each year I&#39;m going to be charging a fee to run the service And curriculum. We&#39;re going to be removing implementation and training.
We can make this, um, How can you join the air conditioning choice? 71. All right. So ignore that. Um, so one thing that, um, we can actually do is instead of putting it 2,500 per year for the second year onward, um, let&#39;s do it.
Yeah, let&#39;s, let&#39;s leave it like that. Um, but, um, well, I&#39;m trying to see if we should switch it to a per user license, but given the fact that they have so few students, it&#39;s not going to make sense at this point.
One thing that we want to emphasize is that it does not include any custom development. It&#39;s simply to run the optimizer and get an output.
If they&#39;re requiring a custom development and to modify change the rules, then that&#39;ll be something that we charge at that time.
And for implementation, we can bump that up to 5k and everything else stays the same. And we can down here, we can remove this, um, additional modules section.
Alright, I guess we can keep that for now. Um, anything that we removed for curriculum, for example, if we remove from the top, we want to put that down here as something that&#39;s available, work hours, we&#39;re going to move it from here and put it to the top.
And then Um, the other thing that Mitch asked about was, um, historical data. Um, but I like to do is write out under the modules.
We want to create two more sections similar to this one is for historical data and say, it&#39;ll be, it will be a custom, a one time fee that we come up with based on the amount of data that needs to be transferred and the work that&#39;s required to do so.
Um, so we can provide that quote right now, essentially we need to see the data and we&#39;ll come up with a one-time fee for that.
And for the other section, the first section is for migration of historical data. Second section is going to be for any custom development that we&#39;re committing to.
So the site demographic feels something that we committed to, uh, the optimizer we&#39;re committing to. So site development, we&#39;re not charging any fee.
It&#39;ll be part of our normal development costs, optimizer. It&#39;s going to be a custom development fee that we determine once we know the scope.
And then you can think, look through our notes and see if there&#39;s any other items that we need to include.
There. I&#39;ve already put the custom development fee for optimizer here. Um, we could also put a line item here for the, um, historical data.
So again, I&#39;m using the Purdue one as a guide here. What we want to do is copy this and apply these changes.
Thank you so much.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f75e15deff9c4496bf64111e7b67b76e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Group/Pod OMS 1 - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 20 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So I wanted to get some, uh, technical input on this so that we can get, make a good decision on it.
So for MSU, for their preclinical workflow, what they do is create a S they take all the 600, some odd students, and they create pods and each pod has thought four students in it.
And then they take these pods and they mix them together to create larger groups for different types of schedules. So lecturers may have a bunch of pods, a lab session that happens on a Monday, we&#39;ll have, you know, three or four pods.
And each of those pods will have, um, about four students each. So this is something they have set up and want to maintain.
This is not something that they&#39;ve done for years in this school is integrated with this process, um, for us to be able to handle this and metrics and have sessions scheduling take place.
There are a couple of ways to do this. And one is to create a group and then labeled them as group one pod one.
And this will essentially create, Um, many group ones that lists out the pods that belong in it. And I&#39;m not a big fan of this because it will require them to go to the session schedules.
And instead of being able to add one thing, be able to, they&#39;ll have to add many different, um, groups to that session.
And given that some of these, uh, some of these, uh, sessions and some of these, uh, uh, lectures may have 10, 15 pods.
That&#39;s a lot of manual entry and room for error. The other approach that seems to make more sense to me is that if they create all of their pods as groups in metrics, and then we use tags as their groups.
So if you want to put a bunch of pods and create a group of that group, since we don&#39;t have the groups of groups capability, the tax, they can add one or more tags for a pot to indicate which parent groups they belong to.
So if we&#39;re going back to, um, um, too many emails, where is that here? So you can see in this example, um, they&#39;re not overlapping, um, the same group into the same pods into multiple groups, but this is something that happens across different courses.
The same pod may be part of multiple groups. So, so that, so the idea of using tags is MSU groups and then keeping the pods as they are.
Um, if we go with that route, then what we have to address is how they can do a session import using these tags.
So on the session schedule import, we could add a tag group tags column, and they include the tag name in there.
And when that import happens, we link all of the groups that have that tag with the session. So we&#39;re not going to add the tax directly to the session itself, since that&#39;s going to require a lot of development changes.
What I was thinking was we simply use to tag and update the import functionality to populate the sessions with those groups that are tagged as such The.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/49ec84f4c2054d359167d6c44e8d24df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Student Issues in Medtrics - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 20 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Emily and Erin hope both of your well about these issues that you reported for the first one where they&#39;re getting an error.
We noticed that on the about me page, um, somehow the, uh, the student had, was able to save like a line break and which is causing an error on the page.
We&#39;re clearing that up and we&#39;re also gonna be updating that field to remove any formatting if they copy and paste that it&#39;s something in there so that it doesn&#39;t cause a problem in the future for the second one, uh, my colleague looked into it and he said that, um, when you are saving a assignment for a student, and if it has some overlap with another assignment, we typically show an alert that says this has an overlap.
And, um, if you try to edit something that has an overlap, it seems to be preventing it, and she seems to not save.
So that&#39;s something that we&#39;ve identified and we&#39;re gonna be updating that page to not have this problem. In the meantime, you can get around it by, um, deleting the first assignment and then recreating the second, the new assignment.
So that way, so if you&#39;re, if you already, if it&#39;s already in psychiatry, um, instead of editing it, you can just delete it and then add the new pediatrics assignment.
And that&#39;s a short term work around until we add an update that will prevent this problem from happening. Um, for this one, I think we need, what we need to look at is, um, whether we&#39;re ready to roll over the curriculum from the last academic period to the current one.
Cause when we started setting up all the curriculum content, it was added to the academic period that was happening, which is the 2021 to 2022.
Um, so, um, I will follow up with you on this one and see if we can move that over to the new academic year.
We may also need to speak to just sicca Wix, uh, to see if it&#39;s okay to do that since she&#39;s working on the curriculum.
So that may take a couple of days for us to confirm that, um, Emily, for the issues that you&#39;re reporting here, first question here you had was, um, can students download these files?
Um, if you add a photo to a student&#39;s account, they can always go to their profile and then right. Click on the image and download it.
If you want to make it easier for them to actually have a file that&#39;s in their documents section, you can upload it as a JPEG file and name it a student photo, and it will appear here and under the document in the certification section, um, let me know if you want us to create a separate document type for that.
Um, if, if so, we can set that up and it will show up here as a professional photo, as a category and with the image underneath that does a two ways that you can handle it for the evaluations.
Um, our evaluation reports are based on the assignment date and, uh, that&#39;s intentional because you w those assignments are going to be made on, uh, specific dates in the, in the context of that rotation.
So for example, if a rotation is happening July 1st to July 28th, and you assign that during that rotation, um, then you could run a report and it&#39;ll pull up evaluations that were assigned during that specific, uh, range.
How are, if we were to pull it based on submission data and people assign it at different times and they&#39;re late with it, then when you select the date range here, you will not pull all the information that you need for a specific rotations you want to report on.
There are other reports that show more details. So for example, if you go to the reports page and assignment status report or compliance report, um, you can, you may be able to, um, export it and see, uh, when the, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/836ff0aa534541e3b67326eaa84ef3f4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Hacking</pre></td><td><pre>I see. So when it, when it comes to, uh, Louisa itself. So the way that I understand it is if we file it, hold on one second.
So if we filed a case with you within 90 days, they would have, um, a decision to move it to the second phase.
And at that point, how long does that typically take? Okay. Possibly another eight months at that point, we see requests for more information in document at the national visa center.
So has to qualify the God&#39;s commands and then reach out to the consulate or embassy to schedule an interview. You could see by the time it goes through those two phases and, um, kind of the features have decided to just get married and go through with that process.
A lot of people with Beyonce &lt;inaudible&gt; because we kind of drift away, uh, the second and third stages, a case in lawsuits, how worked for those.
So that&#39;s why dealing on the file recently that has where with fiance, visa is for that first state at USDA.
Yes, but I try to explain to individuals, you know, depending on kind of the couples, um, timeline of when they want to get married, they want to get married sooner rather than later, then they might as well just go ahead and do that, and then file for visa with a copy of, um, you know, marriage, evidence, marriage certificate, kit.
And then of course the relationship evidence as well from the time that they started dating up until, uh, when they got married.
And for some reason, you know, from what we&#39;ve seen with the trends, um, as far as fiance pieces, they are taking a lot longer.
So I&#39;m not even sure if it would be in their best interest, especially if they&#39;re already considering getting married sooner rather than later.
Okay. Um, yeah, I, I didn&#39;t know that I wish I had known that earlier because they&#39;re actually, uh, in India right now for three weeks and we would&#39;ve just planned for the, I was, cause I think last time I spoke to someone, I was under the impression it was meeting some meetings somewhere, I&#39;m getting to have some photos and evidence.
Um, that was that. So that&#39;s kind of why they apparently they plan the trip. Um, but if they, um, so that we don&#39;t have to start the application again.
Um, so, so I just so that I&#39;m, I can communicate this with the rest of the family. You&#39;re the timeline is will be, if we continue with this route or read three months for Jessica to decision, then we went to the next phase and that probably another eight to nine months before our final decision and visa Possibly.
Yeah. Especially if they&#39;re going through the consulate or embassy in India, we&#39;ve been seeing some delays there as well. So, um, you know, obviously, and they want to try to pursue the lawsuit, even just set up first save.
And I mean, by this time there is more evidence, there is more to add to the fiance, that case that they may request for more evidence anyway, at that point.
Um, so it&#39;s kind of a two fold, you know, you want to push the government to move forward on a case, but if you already know that there&#39;s some things that may be missing such as that evidence of the two individuals meeting in person within the past two years, and you can anticipate, it may take a little longer anyway, because they&#39;re likely going to request for that information and those documents, um, before even moving the case forward.
So I know Tim has hosted some videos about, you know, if you&#39;re waiting too long for the fiance visa, sometimes individuals just choose to get married and go through the spouse, ease a case, and then just submit an ascendance of that evidence with the initial fiery for the stuff, ease a case that way, hopefully you could prevent any further request for as of the end.
Now there&#39;s no guarantees. Even we&#39;ve seen some cases where they file a lot of documents and they still have the government asking for more or clarification about certain documents or information that they included in the initial filing.
Um, but I think in your sister&#39;s case in particular, you know, it may be better. It may be in their best interest, just Christie&#39;s visa after getting married.
Um, but of course that&#39;s, you know, depending on kind of their own timeline and expectations or anticipation of when they want to get married, if they still want to wait it out.
And their point with the fiance visa is that, um, they would have to wait essentially for the stop for the fiance to get the visa from the embassy and then come to the us and then get married, um, and then file for the green card.
Whereas with the spouse visa process, the, uh, conflict can issue essentially the main visa or green card, uh, equivalent at the end of that stage, instead of having to come back to the us file a different application and the wait out that process.
Yeah, there&#39;s still a role there, things that need to be done before, um, your sister&#39;s fiance, uh, and, you know, seem to be so could even get a green card based on just filing for the K one for rather than going straight for the off season.
Okay. So let&#39;s say we do decide to go forward at the, um, the marriage and the spouse visa, um, what your F your office files for that, right.
Can you can help with that When we did it? Yes, we do. Um, our legal fee for that process from start to finish, including filing everything with USP, helping with the national visa center, as well as helping prepare the individual for their interview.
At the end of this year, conflict is 6,500. Uh, we offer monthly payment plan option where the initial payment due is 2000, and then you have monthly payments of 500 for the remaining balance of, until the balance is paid off.
And then the legal fee for the filing fee, the government filing fee for the island, 30 petition is going to be 535.
And then I believe that the second phase of the teeth and national visa center for the visa application firings, it&#39;s about 450 at that point.
Okay. So that would be in addition to that, your fee, Right? Yeah. You know what I mean, filing fees are separate, so that&#39;s why I just like to outline it now expect and when to expect to pay those additional government filing fees.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/436c410c7bda4c5db4a0701a410bef33</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Email notifications for Projects – Figma - 12 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So, what we&#39;re doing on this task is creating a new report. And let me go back to this, uh, Figma file here.
And it&#39;s going to be called the curriculum course summary report. And It&#39;s going to summer this report, I&#39;ll give you a summary of a course, which would include objectives, mapping themes, and keywords, et cetera.
So when you click on that, it&#39;s going to bring them to a page where they can select the academic period select one or more courses.
So we&#39;re going to be able to use a beauty select to select one-on-one courses. And this dropdown should show, It should resemble a, This, this view here, where we show the code and the course name and it&#39;s categorized by the, uh, academic level.
So once they pick the filters and click the generate email report, it will get emailed as a, Uh, attachment to the person that generated the report.
So we will also be adding an email design template here. Um, and the actual attachment is going to be a report that looks like this it&#39;s called the course summary report.
It will show the report date range, And in the report criteria, we&#39;re going to show the, uh, names of the courses that we selected or the course codes.
So it could be An institution. Name is going to be The name of the institution, and then this will be program name.
Um, all right. So once it gets emailed, it&#39;s going to, she could see that as group, the academic level, academic period.
And, uh, we actually Don&#39;t need to show the academic period since it always going to be the same. And it&#39;s all right, we&#39;ll leave it for now.
And then course name course code session, title session, description, session type. So that&#39;s all pretty straightforward. If you go to the curriculum Page, you have the course information, academic level of course, code set title sessions.
And if you select a course, you&#39;ll see the session code. I mean the session title, I would, um, Insert Left Touching code such entitled session description, session pipe, and then here all these columns we&#39;re going to be showing Holly&#39;s.
So if I go into the session itself, Then I will see that I have key words. It will show a count of how many keywords there are.
And then I will show account of the number of instructional methods, number of resources and number of, uh, assessment methods.
And if we go to the mapping And select a session, it&#39;ll show account of the number of objectives that we have linked to it.
So in this case would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So it&#39;ll be seven objectives. And for mapped objectives, we&#39;re going to be showing The sessions that have been mapped.
So if you can see Here, None of these have any mappings. So if you have any of these maps already, then we&#39;re going to be showing account of what&#39;s been mapped.
So key works, instructional methods, assessment methods, resources, total objectives that they, this session has. And out of those total, how many are mapped, I&#39;m going to also add Column to the left, the groups.
Um, So this would show the number of groups that are linked to it. So if I go back to my sessions, It&#39;ll show the number of groups and for scheduled we&#39;ll put guests.
No. Yes. So if there is at least one schedule entry here, we will say yes. And if it&#39;s no Schedules, it&#39;ll say no.
So that should be everything. And we will be emailing this report since it&#39;ll take some time to do all the calculations and, um, generate this report.
And if there&#39;s no data, I see. Yeah, it&#39;s fine to show &#39;em zero.

I wanted to grade this short video to summarizing our discussion from yesterday. So starting with the, the sample optimizer, um, the first version or the first type of optimizers that we created has, um, been using constraints where students are scheduled to different rotations on a daily basis.
So if they have a particular course happening and it&#39;s offered every Monday for 13 weeks, uh, another course having another, um, session habit having two days a week, uh, kind of weekly, uh, assignments on specific days.
And the way that the optimizer worked is we take a set of rules where it&#39;s the course name, the, whether it&#39;s mandatory or elective site available weeks and, um, minimum and maximum and Maxim number of students and other rules that are tied up to that course.
And then this, this set of rules is fed to our optimizer algorithm that has all these constraints built then, and it output to schedule similar to this.
This is, this is an output from our, uh, from one of our tests run with this optimizer. And you can see it includes the course, the, um, the site, the start date and end date, the student identification information.
And then we can take this and import it into metrics so that it populates one of our schedules. So this particular version was built on a set of constraints for daily assignments.
And for LMU, this is not something that element is a schedule can be it, this cannot be used to make LMU clinical schedule.
However, um, this has given us a enough experience with this process to build LMU constraints and build a custom optimizer for all of the courses that are offered at the, at the vet school.
Um, so in order for us to build this, we do need, um, the set of rules for each course and each site.
So this is a template that I had shared on screen yesterday. I cleaned this up a little bit more and put some descriptions at the top.
Essentially it has a whether the course is mandatory or elective. And again, this, when I say course, we also mean in our system, we call this rotation.
Since these are clinical rotations in metrics, we refer to the classroom based training as courses or anatomy, biochemistry, things like that.
If it&#39;s, if it&#39;s a clinical experience, then we call it rotations. But I put a core slash rotation here for us to collect this information.
And then the code associated with that, the name, the site. So one important thing is if a particular rotation is offered in multiple sites, then we&#39;ll want to, uh, create separate roles for that.
So if CVM 7 74 is offered at site a, it will be one role site B it&#39;ll be another row with C with the same, uh, rotation code.
And then you can see here at the site name is here. Um, you can ignore this column. This is, uh, us separating out the different constraints.
Um, I try to break that up into a separate sheet here. Um, you can feel, feel free to look through this.
Uh, this is me pulling out the different rules. So then I can hand this to our team to, um, um, start planning out the, uh, actual quote for building these constraints.
Um, and then on the right side, we also have the prerequisites. So if any of the courses require prerequisites include the list of course codes, the maximum number of blocks.
So if a particular course should only be four weeks, then it&#39;ll be one block. Um, you don&#39;t need to fill out bolt.
You can just put either block number of blocks or the number of weeks, and we can work. We can figure out the rest.
If there is a cap on the number of students maximum or students minimum, or a minimum number of students, and you can add any additional notes here.
So once this is filled out, uh, we&#39;ll be analyzing this data and handing this to our developer, who is, we recently recruited a developer that specializes in M and a optimization, and he&#39;ll be working on custom custom, uh, optimizers for each of our schools that are, that are going to be needing it.
So, um, well, once we analyze it and gives us term, uh, will, we may need to set up a call with him and, uh, we&#39;ll also have a quote for one time fee to have this built and next year it&#39;s something that you&#39;ll be able to use.
And if there&#39;s some tweaks that need to be need made, we can, we need to adjust it. Um, so we&#39;re gonna use it for the first time next year and the following year, it&#39;ll, it&#39;ll be the same optimizer with, uh, any additional customization that needs to be made if there&#39;s courses or sites that we&#39;re changing.
So that&#39;s the, that&#39;s gonna be the process by which we run this, um, input and output. And for the first year we&#39;ll be running this outside of metrics.
Eventually we&#39;re going to be creating an interface where you can define these kinds of rules in the system itself, where you can say, this course has a maximum of eight weeks or a minimum number of students maximum where students, um, before the optimizers is run.
Um, at this time we&#39;ll collect this on the spreadsheet so that we can start building it. So now moving into the system itself, we have talked about, um, entering the capacity, um, for the schedules, um, uh, for the, um, for each of us, uh, preceptors in each of the sites, um, and how that information can be stored in metrics.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/53645e5308084e5b88bc9ef8269a1486</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>FW: Follow up meeting with Medtrics - re: Key Words - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 11 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to create a short video explaining how to convert this USM, really key words into an importable format.
So taking a look at this in metrics, we have a template that allows all the keywords to be imported. And once it&#39;s in the system, it can be used by faculty to link them to different courses and different sessions inside of each courses.
So this is the format that we need, and it contains a unique identifier, which we can simply number them. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Um, he, the keyword itself, the category belongs to, and then you need descriptive text. So if we take a look, look at this PDF that we have, This would be the category.
So I can put that Each of these.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/471e48c7cddf4ed993aae8f7020efe64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So what we&#39;re going to do is, um, W we want to remove this shift leaderboard section here and reply, um, and then move the hide empty shifts button to the top here next to print.
And we&#39;ll also add a new button that says download shift tallies. And when it comes to click in that button, it&#39;ll bring up a modal that allows them to select a date range.
And when they select the date range, um, and click the download shift tallies, it&#39;ll export a spreadsheet that includes columns, uh, for first name, last name, role, and then names of each of the shifts that are on there.
And then we&#39;re going to list out each person&#39;s name in a separate role with total number of shifts they&#39;ve been assigned.
So, for example, if I do May 1st, till May 27th, when I export this is going to have the names of all the people that have been scheduled, um, and names of all the people that are included in this shift, in this shift schedule.
So for example, here we have selected all these roles.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/49ec7dfaf8194dc8b5a54a889dbbefd7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike, so this shift schedule on demo. If I open this up, you can see here a list of all the roles that we&#39;ve been in that are included on this shifts template.
So you can see this shift schedule is for all, all of these roles. And I open that up. We&#39;ll see a list of all the people that match that role with this new task, where we&#39;re going to need to do is show, give the administrator has the ability to download a spreadsheet that tallies up all the shifts that people are assigned to.
This is similar to that, the way that we&#39;ve been doing a Intercom, like one day a week, you know, someone may be scheduled Monday.
Someone may be scheduled Tuesday, and what we&#39;re doing is tallying up all those shifts that they covered and giving the administrators the total number of shifts that they did.
So in order to do that, we want to do some changes to this page. First, as this shift, leaderboard is not very useful to anyone.
So what we want to do is remove this and on the right side, there&#39;s the high leader board and show a leaderboard.
We, this button is also going to go up since we&#39;re not going to have the leaderboard anymore, but we have this other button called hide empty shifts.
We can move this to the top here next to print, since we still need to keep this. And then for the actual tally, instead of showing it on the screen, let&#39;s give them a way to export a spreadsheet.
So next to the print and hide empty shifts button, we&#39;ll add a new button in a light blue that says download shift tallies.
And when you click on that, it&#39;ll bring up a model where they can select a date, range, and click, and then a button called download shift tallies.
And if they click, if they click the date range and click download, it will export a spreadsheet that has a S that has a headers, um, that I included in the, in the fellow.
Um, I screenshot in the, in the fellow, uh, link. I&#39;ll send that to you in slack also, um, it has columns for first name, last name, role, and then separate columns for each of the shifts on this template.
So if I go into here, you can see there are three shift types in here, class daily schedule and test, so will have separate columns for all of them.
And during the selected date range, if an individual has been, has been scheduled to one of those shifts, we will show a tally in the appropriate column.
So if we choose a date range from May 1st to May 27th, it&#39;ll show all of the users, it will have separate roles for all of these users, but we&#39;ll only show a count of one under the class shift type for Alec &lt;inaudible&gt; and count of one for Ben Sullivan.
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s basically telling us that between May 1st and May 27th, Alec did one class shift and Ben did one class shift.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bfba593dca564b64b1f3663bedce7ff2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE CHARTS - Interface – Figma - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi marina. So this is going to be a bit of a long video, and I wanted to give you some context on this charge for the next phase of this MSPE project.
So we&#39;re, we&#39;re working with multiple schools that need to generate a document called the MSPE, which stands for medical school, performance evaluation.
Every medical school in the United States are expected to create a M S P E when a medical student is graduating and applying for residency.
And there&#39;s a general structure to this document, but However, these documents are personalized by the institution and the ma they may have different types of charts they use, and the colors of the charts may be different.
The, um, the, uh, titles may be different. So what we&#39;re trying to do is create a framework where we can have a few types of chart templates hard-coded into this system and give the administrators an interface where they can customize some of the parameters that chart.
So it creates a personalized experience for that school. Before we get into this, I want to start off by going into a few of the charts that our clients are using.
So here we can take a look at this chart here. This is used by our client AUC. And if we look at it, we can see that we have a bunch of different courses here.
These represent graded courses, and we have different bars that indicates the grade book, great status. So if I go into the grade book here, You&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a status here, fail, pass.
We can customize this status. And what we&#39;re doing here is creating bars to indicate the status, and they put an arrow next to the street, this particular student&#39;s bar.
So it&#39;s showing that the entire class, Entire class is, uh, large percentage of them got some got honor, some got, uh, some failed, and we&#39;re putting an arrow next to the, uh, the bar that represents this particular student.
There&#39;s, I&#39;m going to skip this chart for now. So this, this type of chart is an aggregate chart. Since it includes grades from multiple courses.
Then if we look at this chart, this is a chart for particular grit, but cuticular course. So here, we&#39;re focusing on one course, one graded course, and it&#39;s creating a chart that shows the percentage of students that got honors percentage of students that got PA, uh, the past percentages that failed.
And it&#39;s putting the arrow here to indicate this student, uh, this student that is generating the letter or the, for the student, for which this chart, uh, the letter is being generated, got an honors grade the next, um, so w so here we can see percentages here.
We can see counts. The number of students that took the test. I took the class, and let&#39;s say, if we go down further here, And, uh, same thing here, we have a different school Ross university, and you can see the supper charts of being degenerated.
Same thing here we have, Old. We&#39;ll get back to this one later. So I&#39;ll link to this spreadsheet. So if you want to read anything here, um, And in metrics, what we&#39;re gonna be doing is creating this framework where if we go into documents, we&#39;ll have a new section called, uh, charts on the left menu charts, and then it&#39;s gonna have an active and inactive tab.
And we&#39;re going to come here, click new chart. When I click the new chart, it&#39;s going to bring up this page where we can give it a chart, name, chart, title, subtitle, and these titles and subtitles are what we&#39;re going to use in the high charge module to generate the charts.
And it&#39;s going to have a Title and subtitle basis. So for example, this will be a title, internal medicine foundations, And next, we are going to create two types of charts, aggregate charts, which will include charts for that supports multiple courses, Another one for individual courses, And let&#39;s name this actually, Well, of course, specific chart.
And in the future, we may have other additional charts, creative, but we&#39;re not going to start off with two. And this particular get lab issue is going to focus on sharp specific, and of course, specific charts, We will do the aggregate one in a separate task.
So core specific charts are going to be created using the data from the grade book, and we&#39;re going to be generating a separate chart for each grade.
That isn&#39;t a great book for the, uh, for the, uh, for the student, for the course that was included in this template.
Let&#39;s take a look at the next page. It&#39;ll make more sense. So I click core specific chart and I&#39;m, then I click continue.
And the, this bottom part will appear here. I can select one or more courses. If I wanted, I can customize the label here for the X axis.
And for the Y axis, I can either choose percentage or counts. So this reason we&#39;re giving them two different options is because one school may choose percentage to generate This kind of chart.
Another school may have a, uh, a count they want, they would want to show and it&#39;ll, instead of percentages on the left, it&#39;s going to say, um, total attempts or counts.
And that&#39;ll, that&#39;ll tally that out. So once we set percentage, we can give that a label. And if we want to, we can even simplify this task and simply focus on the percentage in this, and then we can do counts as separate, separate feature.
Um, so then we can also customize the bar size Bar chart size with the width and height, and that&#39;s going to represent the PNG files that we generate later.
And you can skip this override recommended sizing for now and here we can specify colors. So by default, the chart will have bars that are of the great bar color, and then the individual trainee will have a different color.
So instead of us putting an arrow, instead of us putting an arrow in above the bar, that is for the student, we&#39;re going to be using colors, substances, easier for us to use high charts and do that.
So they will be able to say, the red color indicates the trainees color on all the other bars will be blue, and this is going to be a text field where they can type in as hex code.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f1f7491039c64b3d8c455f3a901bf393</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Sweta for our dashboard announcements.

And this shows up on the calendar and there&#39;s an email notification also tied to this event. So they&#39;re informed, um, um, that event has happened.
You can put it in the title and description, uh, as something that they need to complete. Another option is it takes a little bit more of a time to set up is our requirements module.
So you can create a set of requirements for each month and, um, have it scheduled to be assigned on certain days.
And when that is assigned, it&#39;ll email them a task so that they can go into the system and mark it off as done, uh, when all of their sessions, uh, session evaluations are completed, so they would complete the session evaluations.
And then, um, mark off the requirement as an acknowledgement that it was done. So you can try the simpler setup with the reminder on the calendar, and if that&#39;s not working, then maybe use the requirements to do a task.

I want to see if we can try something different and, and, um, point out all of the different things that we could do for them, even though it is an RFP, RFP, we can still send it and hopefully the lady will forward it to the appropriate people and that&#39;ll be a, then they can review.
So this document I made earlier this year, we can take this and cut it, cut the whole bottom part here out four and four, page four and five.
And what we can do is at the top, add a section called, um, for meeting notes, meeting summary for may, uh, may, whatever the date was.
And then put a few notes there specifically about the, um, things that you wrote down. So we can say, and have an alert section and say if a metrics includes UT Southwestern, eh, um, is having challenges, uh, with multiple individuals editing, editing this schedule and making sure that there&#39;s no conflict metrics includes, um, alert, alert, uh, alerts for tracking conflicts, with rotations, as well as venues.
In addition to this, we can also, we&#39;re also committing to adding a, an alert for student, um, Curricular and non-curricular events.
So we have rotation based overlap, um, conflict checking, same thing for venue. We&#39;re going to be adding new alerts for curricular and non-curricular events, um, as part of this implementation.
So that could be one section presenting this problem, their product, trying to solve, and then the solution. And then, um, we would also, um, UT Southwestern is also interested in having a unified way to track total number of hours.
And we can say that during, for this one, we could work with, uh, the school to implement a new report that tallies up the hours for curricular and non-curricular events.
So they can make sure that they&#39;re not going over the maximum number of hours. And this will be something that they can run for individuals as well as for multiple students and four event types.
They need to be able to track optional, mandatory versus elective. And we could work on creating this as a, um, event type and metrics.
And then our reports would reflect those, uh, those types of events and they can filter based on that. And I believe that&#39;s pretty much it.
And then we can also end with the future. So the first one will be about alert. Second one will be about this contact hours.
Third one will be about this, uh, optional versus event types. And the fourth one would be future future expansion. And we can mention that metrics is an all in one solution.
And, uh, in the future, once schedules are implemented, metrics can be expanded to include evaluations and other solutions. And I also forgot campus solutions.
We can, um, um, say that metrics does include a API for integration with campus solutions. And this is something that we can, um, assist the school in working on it.
And you can also point out that our current client, uh, Michigan state is also using campus solutions and we are going to be working on integration with them.
And this is something that may help, uh, UT Southwestern in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a90caabe45e84633a3444d27e677b1bb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>results - Google Sheets - 29 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this spreadsheet is an output from our optimizer and it brings in essentially a schedule for each of the students that we have in the system for an SBA to have been part of this optimization process.
And you can see here, see an ID number as your name, whatever they&#39;re all the same. Um, and then it also shows you the course, the date that they&#39;re assigned to and so on.
And what we have to do is check this data to make sure that the constraints for the school are being met.
So, uh, for example, if we look at bovine, as student must attend that, um, attend the class only once. So if we look at here and let&#39;s sort this by it to Z and look at Bullvine, so bovine is only scheduled once for this.
Let&#39;s see if it is scheduled, they should only be scheduled once. And that is true for that first, I mean the second student and we look back here, actually, these are mandatory rotations.
So if we look at this, uh, yeah, so the first student also has it. So the first student has it here, second student has it here.
Then the other thing that we can test here is, um, It&#39;s only being scheduled in weeks, one through 11 to do that.
We can sort this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/323cf599baec4de5b1d3f9d20058c09c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sem 7 Schedule details for eValue dd June 16.xlsx - Google Sheets - 29 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this is the lottery, sorry, optimize the rules for Ross. And this is the output that we have from our optimizer code.
And this includes a list of students, and let&#39;s see how many screen, 130 students and their schedules. What we have to do is test them out to see if most of these constraints are being met.
Um, all of them should be being met, but it&#39;s hard to manually check for all of them. So our goal is to try to test as many as we can, as a for example, um, these are the mandatory courses and all the students should have these courses with these rules.
Um, they&#39;re offered weeks one through 11 and for the first one, for example, student must attend once to complete this.
So if I look at this results and sort this, uh, by the student and look at bovine once here, once for the second student, once was the third student.
So we can spot check that and make sure it&#39;s correct. Second. Um, so that&#39;s then that would be tested and complete.
Um, we could also make sure that it&#39;s only offered on a Monday. So bovine is 30th. 20th is actually a Sunday.
So we may need to make a note of that. So let&#39;s check, um, communications, if it&#39;s Thursday, if it&#39;s Wednesday, then maybe we just need to shift everything over one.
So communications, uh, 1 23, 20 22. So that could be this one that&#39;s on a Sunday that&#39;s to after hours.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b49858c4b96447969abc505279208eef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 22 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Template. Let&#39;s just go to this random one assignment rules. So this, this part here, we really need to also do some UX improvement, but I&#39;m not going to think about that.
Like can evaluate these start assignments that doesn&#39;t really like, I was reading that. What does that mean? They should be because of their position.
Can they actually start one? So like allow, evaluate tees to request or initiate evaluations, um, to evaluate, and then you can put an explanation.
We can put an explanation saying if this is enabled the, we will show a tool on their dashboard that allows them to request someone else in the organization to evaluate them.
So that&#39;s what is, um, but forget about that, this, we can improve this later. Uh, but the way that it works is if I turned this on and then let&#39;s say, which was, which rotation should be included and include all these and who should complete this form, I&#39;m going to put, um, let&#39;s just put all who should be evaluated.
It&#39;s going to put the students and no do not automatically assign. So we can, we have the ability to make this an open evaluation or, and, or allow them to request evaluation.
I&#39;m going to just focus on the request evaluation list, uh, turn that on. And the a S D F one.
So if I now log in, as let&#39;s say Alec, on the right side, we have this little widget. Yeah. So the first thing is this little widget is going to be missed by everybody.
Yeah. So it&#39;s better. So requesting an evaluation is like a critical operational thing because they need to do, this is not something that is like, oh, well, whether or not someone&#39;s off, these are like, these are like nice to know things.
So this needs to really be moved up here. And then I&#39;m thinking, instead of having this as like a, um, we can have it as a, as like this, but we can make it into like a button that says request evaluation and it&#39;ll bring up in a model so that it right in the middle.
And so this is currently how does it even show up here? So the reason it didn&#39;t show up for Alec is because he would only, you would only see forms from your primary program.
So Alex primary program is probably not where I just made this. So there&#39;s another reason why you shouldn&#39;t be using super admin.
So I&#39;m going to log in as a Harry Cox or two evaluations templates. So it is here under school of medicine.
Let&#39;s see if Alec is in here. He&#39;s not so not in that program. So let me go find Alec. Um, because I figured like a lot there, one of the reasons I want to start coming back to the office is so that I can have more these kinds of discussions.
And it&#39;s rather than my being busier, because my goal is to try to like, have as many interactions as possible when I&#39;m here in here to share, uh, knowledge and me being in a yeah.
And the other kind of, the other reason is also if I&#39;m David is going to come back, I rather than he would prefer to have a separate office because he, someone that is coding and stuff like that, rather than me having a bunch of discussions walking in here and stuff like that.
So, um, and it&#39;s been working out well, it&#39;s easy for everybody to walk in here and ask questions and stuff like that.
So now we&#39;ve got to link him to the right. Yeah. Yeah. So this one is currently on internal medicine, school of medicine.
Okay. Save and close. Okay. Now that should show up and is, Yeah, I&#39;m going to log out. Okay. And then Login as this guy.
Let&#39;s see. Okay. There was my theory. Um, Figure this out. Let&#39;s see. Valuations templates, Simon rules, Uh, Cool. Complete this form.
Make sure that Primary program got saved. School of medicine. What&#39;s his role? His role  so I feel like it should work.
Okay. All right. Let me try it one more time. It doesn&#39;t work. We&#39;ll just work with what&#39;s here. So I don&#39;t know.
It&#39;s not working out to figure out maybe it has something to do with the bug. Um, so moving this up here, and the other part of it is if I&#39;m selecting these, we need to, uh, make it more intuitive.
Like it says select an option. It doesn&#39;t really say what these fields are. There&#39;s no labels for these fields. So they should be able to select a form like select form.
And then I want, I want to put the, these, this is supposed to show their schedule in here. All the rotations that I shot.
That&#39;s the bug that they&#39;re fixing. But what I want to do is for us to move this, um, rotation up.
So if I&#39;m working on, um, if I&#39;m selecting a form, then I&#39;ll be able to select what rotation I work in.
And then it will show me a list of supervisors that are relevant to that rotation because none of them in the rotations, okay.
We can add rotation supervisors. Right. So it&#39;ll only show me that&#39;s people that are part of that rotation. Right. I got it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3a72328faa324c89b76c885e0cda02a3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Test – Figma - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So this task is for shifts schedules. And what we have so far is at the top, we have a list of all the roles that are enabled on the shift template and then a leaderboard, which we can hide and show.
What we need to do is remove this leaderboard and give the users a way to tally up how many shifts each person has completed.
And what I&#39;m thinking is instead of trying to do anything in the interface is best. If we do an export from here and what we can do is remove this entire leaderboard section and move this, uh, hide empty shifts and show empty shifts to the top here, next to print.
And then we could add another button that says, um, download Shift tallies. And then when you click on it, it&#39;ll bring up a window, a little model window that says, allows them to select a date range.
And when they collect, uh, select the date range from a starting and end date, and then it&#39;ll have a button that says download tallies, that&#39;ll export a spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet can have the following columns. It&#39;ll be, um, last name, first name, and then roll and separate columns for each of the shift names.
So if you see here, there are three shift names, class daily schedule test, and then in each of those columns, we&#39;ll have an account.
So essentially, if we look at The spreadsheet, It&#39;ll be last name, first name, Um, role. And it will be class, At least schedule John Smith, John 1 5, 2, and then total it At the bottom.
And so what this is doing is counting up right, listing out all the users that are on the schedule, and then tell us, generating a tally of how many times they&#39;ve been assigned a shift for the selected day range.
And, uh, we could Please for July 1st, 2021. So that way we can clean up this interface and remove this part, and then it&#39;ll have a button that brings up the model and they will export into CSB.
And this section at the top is listing out all the roles which we can keep. We only want to remove this, this leaderboard.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/379289c4d8ab4a0db023d762e5263681</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike I&#39;m. So this is the curriculum dashboard that we had worked on some time ago it&#39;s currently hidden. So the only way to access it is to go to our server login as a trainee, a student or a resident.
Um, so in this case, I&#39;m on Monte fear, but you don&#39;t want to test it on Montefiore. You can use demo, um, or, or use Monta fears, a staging server.
What first thing that I want to, um, review is this page is a hidden, because we have not finished the development for it.
And what I&#39;m hoping we can do is address some of these blogs and finish it up. So I&#39;m going to try to describe what I&#39;m seeing as problems, and then you can turn those into a, into a task.
Uh, first thing is when I arrive here, I&#39;m taking to the grade book, which is not ideal because, um, they&#39;re coming to the dashboard for seeing course data.
It shouldn&#39;t be taken to the gradebook tab. So it should be taken to the week view by default, then from the top, there&#39;s no way to change the courses.
I mean, it changed a week here. It&#39;s simply a hard-coded. And then on the, um, view here, you can see there&#39;s overlap between these buttons.
So we can fix that alignment a little bit. And in the courses, along the left side, um, I should be seeing the current, uh, academic period at the top, and then other ones below that.
And right now it&#39;s showing every single course in the platform listed out. And you should only be seeing the courses that this particular student is enrolled in then in the middle here.
Um, it should be showing all of the, um, sessions for this week, so we can have an all week button.
And it shows you all the sessions for the week. If I click on a specific one, it&#39;ll limit it down to that specific day.
Um, and it&#39;s showing session title session time, and the course that it belongs to the speaker speakers on the leaders as the same.
So we don&#39;t need to show it twice the venue. And when I click on this little view icon, it will bring up a model that&#39;s similar to the courses and rotations model.
So if I go into the, uh, courses rotations, and I click on a session, I click show, it brings up this model.
What we want to do is do the same thing here. If I click on this, it brings up a model.
And if I click download, it will all the, uh, attachments for this particular course. Then if I go to the courses for you and select an academic year, and I can see the course details here, Um, which seems to be working fine here.
One of the bugs here is, um, if it doesn&#39;t have data, for example, if the theme doesn&#39;t exist, we don&#39;t need to see, say show the theme, colon.
It can just show it. If there is data, then materials listing out what are the materials for that week? Um, this is going to be showing all the files that are linked to a session.
You know what we could, um, we could keep this simple by, um, in the first version, hiding these three tabs and simply having the week view and the course for you.
So that way it&#39;s easier for us to finish this. So those are the things that I can think of right now.
It will be good if you can go to this page and play around with it and look, compare it to the, um, courses page in sessions page and see how we can address any of the bugs here and finish it up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d2218813c58b4eb49b2a0dcff81adf02</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Home Institution</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Janell for this, a home institution problem that you&#39;re having. After some research, I wanted to share what I found.
So this is a demo instance of metrics. And one thing that I noticed is that I just created this user called James&#39; story, and I&#39;m gonna open this user up.
And, uh, actually let&#39;s go to the demographics page first. Um, I click edit demographics. We could see that the home institution is metrics hospital east, and I&#39;m going to cancel this and then want to go to James again, open up the profile.
And if I go to the education tab, we&#39;ll see that the IRS default here is filled in and whenever a new user is created, we have a blank GME program entry that&#39;s set up here.
One of the things that I wanted to check with you is when you create a new program here, or when you update this section here, are you removing this blank entry and creating a new program?
Or are you clicking, edit and updating this? Because what I&#39;ve noticed is that if I delete this entry and then add a new program, it is removing the home institution from the user&#39;s profile.
Um, so if you are doing that, what you can do is next time we create a new user instead of removing this simply click edit and you can update what is already there with the program name, start date and end date that would prevent it from being removed from the edit demographics page.
Um, we are working on our end to, um, avoid this from happening at all. So that even if you delete an entry or, um, you shouldn&#39;t even have to have a blank entry in here, just leave it as a blank space.
And you can just come in and add a new program, but that is going to take us some time to address.
In the meantime, every time you create a new resident or a fellow, you&#39;ll see this blank entry, um, instead of deleting it, click, edit, and update it.
And that may resolve this issue. Cause that is the only thing that I found that will prevent, that would remove that home institution field.
Um, hopefully this helps, uh, please let me know if, um, this is, uh, this is something that, um, that happens again.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d04bac309cf4481d88ee174036125542</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Import Data</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Michelle. So we&#39;ve been reviewing the data for the last couple of days and it took a little longer than expected because we have, we want it.
We need to figure out what&#39;s the best way to clean up what we have so far. So the problem right now is we create, there are rotations that were created in metrics that have specialty names.
And, uh, if you add preceptors to each of those specialties, then metrics will assign evaluations for all preceptors in a particular rotation.
So what we have to do is create separate rotations for each of the preceptors so that we can target evaluations individually.
And we can&#39;t automatically do that in the system. So we&#39;ll likely have to clean up what we have in there and do another import.
But rather than having you create this data manually, we wanted to try to generate a spreadsheet that we can import and save some time.
So if we look at this, um, sheet here, what we did was we looked at the second sheet, we wrote a couple of, uh, uh, scripts that took data from here and generated M metrics import files.
So if we look at this sheet called metrics rotation import, you&#39;ll see there&#39;s a column for rotation name. And this column now includes specialty site ID, as well as the last name of the preceptor.
If there is a preceptor and we also have the code name with the same information, and then this also includes the rotation supervisor.
If they have one, we&#39;ll put the email address. So when it gets imported, those accounts are created. So this comes, this data comes from this first sheet over here.
So what we had to do was write a script that looked at each role and combine the course name with the site ID, with the last name of the teacher, and that would create the rotation name.
And then we put the teacher&#39;s email address, but the teacher&#39;s email address from, uh, One of the sheets. I forgot which one to create the last column here.
So that was, this is a rotation in ports. What we need your help is, um, doing some data check to make sure this is accurate because with the script we&#39;re able to get this generated, uh, for all the rotations, it does need to be spot checked to make sure.
So for example, there are some scenarios where there may be more than one preceptor. We want to make sure that this is accurate.
And if we don&#39;t have an email address for those rotations supervisors, uh, you can, you have outside of the spreadsheet, you can add it here.
So this would create all the new rotations along with the rotation supervisors. When we import this file, then we have the actual assignments.
So this rotation code links back to this rotation name here With the site code. This email address is from the students Email address right here, And then the start date and end date.
So if you&#39;ll take a look at the student Family medicine, So here eight one till 9, 9 20 22 8 1 9 9 20 22.
So this import file. So first we would import the rotations. Then we would do import of this rotation assignments, and this would create the block schedule So, yeah, so we would need your help to confirm this, this sheet as well as the sheet to make sure it is accurate.
And in order to compare that you can switch back to these, this original data file and make sure that make sure that it&#39;s a It&#39;s correct.
And if there&#39;s any missing data you have that you can fill it in for the rotation preceptors and, uh, their names, email address on their names.
So please let me know if you have any questions.

And, uh, I&#39;m also available later this week, if you&#39;d like to have a call to talk through this in more detail.
So this is, uh, a pricing guide for the Chamberlain university and we we&#39;ve included enough detail so that it can, um, be scaled up to other programs, if that is a decision that&#39;s made.
So, first thing that I wanted to highlight at the top of the first document here is, um, just general overview of as a company, but a few key areas that makes us, uh, unique.
So from a platform perspective, one of the key things that we like to focus on is the usability for the end users, whether it be students or faculty members, to make sure that they have a good experience and make.
And so they can submit the data that&#39;s required for reporting. And also from the platform itself, it&#39;s built in a way that it can be scaled up for any number of users or any number of training programs in one system.
And we also have rest API APIs that can be used to hook it up to other platforms that the university is using and for implementation and relationship with each of our clients, we use a multidisciplinary approach for implementation.
Uh, when it comes to our implementation committee, we usually designate something, someone from our development team, some from my clinical team, as well as someone from our customer success team, so that there is, um, all areas involved with the project.
And then when it comes to, uh, each of those project, we use our, um, those, uh, those implementation projects have multiple meetings with each of the institutions and making sure that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ae9b3d1331a143a8a2256ba30592fec7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 4 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So I&#39;ve been looking into this, uh, home institution issue for the past few days. And I believe I figured out what is happening.
So if I create a new user let&#39;s okay. Sam, Um, C Okay. That&#39;s okay. 1, 2, 3 ad metrics, lab.com. Then I go into home institutions, uh, select metrics, lab, role PGY one, And then I&#39;ve create this user.
So Sam K is created. And then if I open up Sam, You&#39;re going to go to two places. One is the head of demographics, which Is going to show the metrics lab selection here.
And then if I go to the education tab, I&#39;ll see that the employer slash home institution was, um, populated. And then a blank GME program history record was also made.
So looking at John Dorian&#39;s account here. So when I created the user, we have the home institution being populated. And then when you click save and continue the GME program history, um, also gets a site, uh, entered.
This is not the new user we created. This is the, this is the, um, uh, John Dorian user. So what I believe is happening is once Janell creates a user she&#39;s going in here to add GME program details.
So she sees this blank entry and she&#39;s deleting this. So if I go ahead and delete this, What it does is it wipes out Every a that record, which removes the site, that&#39;s linked to it.
Um, but then it also removes This field here. So she is removing it and then she&#39;s adding her own clean data.
Uh, and then that is removing it from the home institution here. The, we could tell her to edit, um, the, instead of deleting it, telling her to edit it as a short-term solution, which is fine.
But what we really need to do is figure this out properly since it&#39;s such an important field. And here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking we could do is when a user is created, We&#39;re populating the home institution field on the user record or the user object.
And that is this field. We should prevent the GME program history from being created when a user is created, so that it&#39;s not confusing.
The admin administrator, we only populate this when they come to the education page and they click add program, we could put a dropdown at, um, at the top that is called at the top or right above this institution field that is called, uh, um, employers slash home institution.
And this text field can just be renamed to other institutions so they can type it in something if they need to.
I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s necessary, but just for the historical records. But this down that we add here is going to be this site field, which is a second field.
That&#39;s linked to the GME program history. When the record is being created, we&#39;re going to, when you, when you open up this model to create a new record, we&#39;re going to pull from the home institution field on the user&#39;s record.
And pre-populate it with the institution, um, into that dropdown, they can change it if they want to. If they let&#39;s say, if I, instead of metrics lab, I chose Kaiser that one, then I save it.
I&#39;m only saving that Kaiser entry for this program that I created. It&#39;s not going to change on the home institution on the user&#39;s page.
It totally going to change it for this record. So that way we can have one home institution for the user, which represents where they are now.
And then for each of the GME program histories, we would have a separate, um, home institution or site that&#39;s set.
So that also works for someone graduating and going somewhere else. So it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it keeps that historical data intact. And, um, so, but I&#39;m not sure how this will impact the Iris queries.
Um, so that&#39;s what we need to figure out. So anyway, this is, um, so the short term solution will be for me to follow up with her.
Once I confirmed, this is the problem, uh, and, and having her edit the record instead of deleting it. But we also need to figure out if the, what the long-term solution is.

So I logged in as Monta fear, resident, uh, portal here.
And a couple of things that were missing from the personal portals is, um, at the top you have the hypertension course.
So this is showing the course that I selected. And from the admin side, if you look at a course, there&#39;s a course description that we are not showing up here.
Um, so what we want to do is under in this hypertension section show the, um, course description. Let me see if I can show you on the admin side, I go to courses and add it.
We have the course description. So everything that we&#39;re showing here, um, is showing up here except for the course description.
And you can also see the, uh, actually the attendance type, mandatory elective. That&#39;s not showing up. So I&#39;m enrolled in this course and I should be able to see the course description.
And I scroll down here. This is the list of the sessions that are part of this course. And if I open this up, I can open up the session and see all the details except for the session objectives.
So what we want to do is at the bottom of this show, the session objectives for this, it can kind of list it out.
So for that, if I go into sessions, you can see this is the session category with the code, and then the session description and the session, um, session code, and session, uh, title here.
So we don&#39;t need to make a fancy table like this. All we need to do is list it out with a, um, 1.1, obtain an ocular family history in bold, and then each of the objectives under this one as one point.two.one, and identify risk factors that make help relevant that may have relevance for primary and secondary cataracts.
So two different, um, changes. One is showing the course description. Second is showing the session objectives under the, uh, under the, uh, appropriate, uh, session model.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1e1cae2aa15e487c98d16f84a793c76d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Message - 21 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Keona. Hope you had a great weekend sending over this a pricing document for Chamberlain university. I also wanted to include this video to kind of, um, explain some of the, uh, content in there.
And I can always hop on a call and discuss this in more detail. So what the first page just provides a general overview of us as a company.
I did include, um, a few sections here that highlights some of the, uh, unique aspects of the company. And one of the main things that I want to emphasize here is the, um, when it comes to onboarding metrics, we do use a, a multidisciplinary approach for implementation.
We have a multiple members of our team incorporated into the, uh, implementation project, um, whether it be the clinical, uh, expertise, technical expertise, as well as a, um, uh, customer success side.
So that it&#39;s, it&#39;s, uh, it&#39;s not just the one individual that&#39;s working on an implementation for an organization. The other, um, aspect of the relationship with our clients is we try to keep the pricing pretty straightforward and simple so that when it comes to a large deployment of metrics, there may be some things that we discover along the way that is unique to that organization, or that may require some tweaks or, uh, additional modifications to the platform.
And for all implementation so far with the Tallyman other clients will become across any roadblocks like that. We try to address that proactively, um, and as part of the same costs, uh, of the subscription, rather than adding it as custom development fees, um, there is a custom development option that can be done for any major modules or large projects that we need to do, but our subscription includes the, any small modifications or customizations as required for deployment with each institution.
And then down here, um, we&#39;ve, uh, outlined the recommended modules. These are all, these are not all the modules that metrics offers, but we try to look at the modules that the medical school&#39;s using and then the modules that were used for the two deployments that we recently had and tried to align that so that the pricing is more straightforward.
And here, this shows a breakdown of the tiered pricing, um, as more students that are added to the system, and I&#39;m hoping that this will make it clear, um, on how the contract will be, uh, adjusted, if more programs will be added in the future.
And then metrics pricing is dependent on strictly the number of students. It includes unlimited educator at administrative users is inclusive faculty preceptors, or any it staff then for implementation.
There&#39;s two approaches that we can take for the medical school side. We used in a Talem led implementation, where Kevin served as an on list, and we work directly with the Kevin to do the implementation.
And then for the two Chamberlain programs that we onboarded, we led that implementation working directly with the deans. So this is also something that we can do for other programs, or it can be led through a Talem at a lower cost.
And then if there is a multi-year commitment, we can also apply discount here for custom development, um, anything related to a onboarding project.
Uh, we try to include that. And this is something that we, uh, work with the implementation committee on the Italian side as part of the project, but for any major modules or, um, modifications that are required, we offer a flat rate for that.
Um, the project after implementation, we do have a dedicated customer success managers that&#39;s included, um, with the relationship there&#39;s direct to customer support via phone email, and live chat.
That&#39;s included metrics has a live chat interface in the platform that can be used to contact our team, uh, directly from the system.
And we do our own support in house. This is not outsource. So you&#39;re reaching team members, uh, in the, in our Philadelphia office who was familiar with your deployment.
We do not charge for training. So this is, uh, also a unique, uh, aspect of metrics. Um, regardless of whether it be initial training or any recurring training, as long as it&#39;s scheduled in advance and it&#39;s virtual, we can do as many training sessions as needed to make sure the organization is, uh, up to speed.
And this is also useful in the future. If there&#39;s new, um, leadership that&#39;s coming in and we can offer that training for onsite training, there is a fee, um, but for virtual training, it is included and we believe that it&#39;s best for us to invest this time into the training so that, um, all users are familiar with how metrics works documentation.
There&#39;s a knowledge base as well as interactive guides and PDF guides that are included. And then for integrations and enterprise solutions, a few things I wanted to highlight here.
So every client receives a staging server. This is a clone of the production environment and our, uh, our, um, infrastructure automatically loads, a backup of the previous day&#39;s data into the staging environment.
This can be used by the, the it team at Talem to build or test integrations, new features or new content, uh, before it&#39;s rolled out to the production environment.
And then there is also full rest API access. So if autonomy interested in building custom integrations with metrics, we have APIs for all of our modules, and we can also work with the institution to create custom documentation for any integration that is, needs to be done.
Um, so this is part of this subscription. If there is a need for integration of metrics with Tableau or power BI, this is something that we can support, uh, in terms of setup and having a dedicated server that hosts the database, um, subscription fees for the business intelligence platforms not included, and then data warehousing.
This was already in place for the medical school, but if it&#39;s necessary for Chamberlain, we can set up a dedicated data warehousing server that hosts a backup all the production data, and it can be sinked with an, with, um, a snowflake or any other data warehousing solution that&#39;s being used for Chamberlain.
Uh, last section here, additional ad-ons, uh, we don&#39;t price based on storage. Uh, it is something that we typically our servers having one terabyte of storage for each, each, uh, institution.
And that&#39;s usually more than sufficient for many years of use. And if there is any, um, um, additional requirement we can adjust based on that, please know that we don&#39;t support video storage and platform, but you can provide hyperlinks to external platforms like zoom or Adobe for recorded lectures.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/78f98d92c5e143c6afcb92b59b5523ae</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Schedule upload Raw Data - Filter by startdate - Google Sheets - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Michelle. So for the data that we received from you, we went through both spreadsheets and this one with historical marks, clinical 4 27, we reviewed all of the columns here.
And then we worked on a Excel script to generate a couple of import files that we can use to recreate the data based on what we&#39;re seeing in metrics.
It&#39;s not going to be possible for us to edit what was there and clean it up. But what we can do is try to automate the, I try to try to automatically create import files so that you don&#39;t have to enter the data manually.
So this is our attempt at doing that. So what we did was we looked at this first sheet and use the data here to generate a new metrics rotation import file.
So if you look at this law, this metrics rotation import tab, you&#39;ll see that the rotation name includes the specialty site code, as well as the last name of the preceptor.
So we automatically generated this rotation name. Well, it wasn&#39;t automatic. We had to write a bunch of scripts to do that.
And it includes the rotation, um, code, which has a similar coding structure, site, supervisor email address. And this is coming from this data comes from this first sheet.
So what we did was we looked at the course name, look, who&#39;d looked at who the teacher is and site ID Sheet.
So here here&#39;s where we got it from.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2fe4e4da00b34cd7bad9d3f25e8558a1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Launch Meeting - Zoom - 23 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>They kind of, we see his test.com. So it was just kind of doing our own platform for that. So pretty much any of that kind of stuff.
I&#39;m probably getting into too many of the leads. So I apologize. No, no, th this is, this is a helpful, so what we are actually much smaller than your company.
Um, so we&#39;re, we, I think, um, let&#39;s see. Um, we have six people in the U S we have two people in Brazil and, um, uh, uh, Brazil, we have one little developer and dev ops person.
And then, uh, two other guys here in Philly are developers and then four in India. So we&#39;re, we&#39;re your offshore team now?
Um, or there an India they&#39;re in, uh, Cunanan. Yeah, the, the, I think the guys are there too. Um, so your F so how do you work with them in terms of you meet with them or?
Yeah, so every morning we have a daily standup with them, which is kind of, you know, their evening. Um, and so that&#39;s just to kind of make sure that we have everything on track.
They&#39;ve been with us for, uh, just about two years now. And so they&#39;re really integrated with our team in terms of like communicating.
They&#39;re great. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve sent an email and it&#39;s like one in the morning there, and they&#39;ll still email me back and I&#39;m like, Hey, that&#39;s awesome.
They&#39;re very committed to making sure that things go well, if there&#39;s a problem they&#39;re always available, which is really nice.
So we tend to have a really kind of, um, well, good communication, but we do meet every day to discuss kind of what happened.
What&#39;s going on. Usually since my team is all based in Arizona, I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s east coast. I usually reach out to them earlier in the morning.
You know, if I know that there&#39;s something that was being deployed or there there&#39;s a problem that we had or something that they weren&#39;t sure about that maybe an answer to I&#39;ll touch base with them in like, when it&#39;s morning for us, because then my team&#39;s asleep.
I can make sure stuff gets done before everybody else gets in. So it actually has been really nice to have, you know, those disparate time zones, because I feel like we&#39;re a lot more productive that way.
Yeah. Yeah. So, so in terms, yeah, I mean, we operate in a very fluid time, uh, also in terms of, I mean, we S we have client clients that operate a certain time, so we have to be running, um, during the daytime, but in terms of dev teams and things like that, they have, we don&#39;t really have any set hours except for like, we have a morning meeting.
So, um, tell me about in terms of any, so I founded the company back in 2013. I&#39;ve sort of, um, like, um, I, uh, I handle the, uh, handled, uh, the UX and the, and product management over the years.
And even now, like I manage the roadmap and picking out what to do, and like, w we have a UX person that&#39;s more helping with the UI part now.
Um, so I would decide like what to build and kind of communicate that with him in a microwave design. So what I&#39;m, what I&#39;m hoping to do is the reason that I, that we posted this so that I need to decrease the, I haven&#39;t been doing a great product management role because my time is split with growing the company and sales and clients.
And, uh, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, um, the challenge also is, um, the us as a company, um, there&#39;s going to be quite a bit of mentoring that&#39;s involved for our developers.
Um, and what I mean by that is, um, the team members, they have not, some of the team members have not worked in a larger team.
Um, so like you, you mentioned like standard product management process things. Yeah, No I&#39;m saying like, you&#39;re, you met, you mentioned like, oh, it&#39;s a standard product management, but we may, we currently don&#39;t have it standard.
Like we&#39;re not really, we have a really good development workflow in terms of you use get lab. Everything is automated.
We have deploys that are automated. Our, our, uh, our dev ops team member in Brazil is amazing. Like we have, we have staging instances for all of our production servers.
Um, each of our branches automatically deploy a, uh, an instance so that we can test on there. Um, so all of those things are really good at that.
The, uh, the communication and planning aspect of it that I do in terms of coordinating with different plant team members and working with devs, you know, they, they&#39;re not always, uh, uh, individuals to share everything that needs to be shared.
And then the client facing teams are sort of like stuck figuring out then, you know, the product manager at which ends up, I have to put that hat on.
And it&#39;s kind of like, um, D um, so I guess, like, what is your experience with, uh, or mentoring or persuading, a younger team members to change their processes, um, and employment, Do you Feel comfortable?
Yeah, I do, because I&#39;ve dealt with that a lot in my career. So when I was early in my career, I worked at GoDaddy and we implemented agile across the entire organization while I was there and getting people to switch from using DRDs using user stories Was so much more difficult than it should have been because I&#39;m just kind of get stuck in their way and they know what they&#39;re comfortable with.
And so I think they use kind of have to explain the why behind what you&#39;re doing, because that really helps them understand.
Like, I&#39;m not just asking you to do this because it&#39;s a process I&#39;m asking you to do this because it leads to a, B and C, you know?
And so even right now with the team that I work with, they don&#39;t like estimating anything. It took me six months to get them to start estimating because they&#39;re like, well, I don&#39;t know, we&#39;re working on three things at once.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5507d44b034f42459f8419d4841da3ef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Change Person | Django site admin - 4 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So I&#39;ve been testing out, um, All of them that, That I&#39;m Janell reported execution institution disappearing. And this is the best explanation that I could come up with.
And I believe that is the reason why she&#39;s having this problem When a new user is being created in the User&#39;s page.
So I&#39;m going to go ahead and create a Sheet. Let&#39;s recreate what she&#39;s doing. Uh, log-in it&#39;s very cocked Go to user&#39;s page, Resident, user.
Let&#39;s call it past, Um, Poems. Oh, it doesn&#39;t matter. The username email it is. But when I come here, I select, uh, metrics, hospital, east select PGY two doesn&#39;t matter.
We&#39;re going to just select something and save Plus. Okay. And then I&#39;m going to go. Sam Jones has Metro&#39;s hospital east.
I opened up the profile. We have this blank, GME home, um, GME program history and entry being made. And I, uh, I believe this was a new bulb that was introduced, uh, because we had this problem when we initially did a migration for, um, when that, uh, home institution was initially created.
But I believe we got rid of this blank entry being created. I could be wrong, but anyway, he, the, the, the, the reason I think this is the issue is if I go in here and delete this entry, then this is wiping out The GME, um, uh, GME program, history entry, including the home institution that&#39;s on that record.
And if I go into the edit demographics page, again, this has gone. So, Um, so we have this home institution on the user page.
This is what John Dorian, not for, um, The new one I just created. And if I go to the GME program history, we have this site for the GME program is free entry.
So here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking we can do to solve this. And I want to know if this is, if there&#39;s any problems with this approach.
Um, since it looks like GME program history has a site for each entry. What I&#39;m thinking is when we create a new user, we have their home institution, uh, being defined.
That&#39;s going to be on the user record, which represents their current home institution. When you go to the graduate medical education page and click add program, let&#39;s change this to other home institution or other institution, and then put a dropdown above this that says, um, uh, employer slash home institution or institution employers as an institution as an up.
And it&#39;s going to pre populate with the selection that they entered as the home institution, uh, when, when the user was being created.
So when the users created, they define the field on the user record. When the GME program is being created, the first program is being created.
We pull from the user and pre-populate it. They can change it if they want to. So for each GME program entry, well, they can set a different site if they want to.
So that way, if someone is graduating and changing something, um, their site record is being linked to the actual GME program, history entry, instead of having just one entry, one, a home institution, that&#39;s tied to their user account.
So, anyway, so this is sort of, um, I think this will prevent mistakes, but I don&#39;t know the implications on this on Iris, so that needs to be investigated.
Um, and I also want to know if there&#39;s any other things that are missing from this approach. So the first thing is, um, creating the user without creating the.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/663e2b0971514e6b8d5c1c83e514099b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma - 18 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So for this functionality, what we&#39;re doing is updating our group&#39;s page to support tags. And these tags are going to be used to select multiple groups at one time.
So first thing we want to do is update the manage at T managed tax button on the program, admin portal and the groups page.
And then when you click on that, it&#39;ll bring up a model. This is going to be similar to the model that we have on the key works for curriculum.
And essentially it allows them to create these tags, edit them and delete them or deactivate them. So deletion should only be allowed if a tag has not been used in a group at least once.
So this is how you use groups. And this, I use tags in a group and I&#39;m creating or editing a group.
There&#39;s going to be a field at the bottom. We can use a view tree select for this and allows them to select any of the active tags and tag that group.
With that, we can allow multiple tags in the same group and you don&#39;t have to look at the design. Exactly.
Does it need to be, this color is you would just use a standard view tree select, and then the selected tags are also going to be in the list view where you can see, uh, this was the tags for this group.
Um, we also need to update our import CSV. So upload, um, groups here. We have a template that we want to update with.
Um, another column that&#39;s called a group tags and the tags going to be separated by comma. And then Once they are all set up in the system, uh, we also have groups being used on the curriculum.
And as part of the curriculum setup, page migrate curriculum, we copy groups from one semester to the next and one academic period to the next.
And when those groups are being copied over, like if they choose a new groups here, the tags also need to be copied over.
So we had to update this migration script for that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/89e0103b96f9409c94e4e461b9467b3c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Schedule upload Raw Data - Filter by startdate - Google Sheets - 10 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Michelle. So we took a look at this spreadsheet and went through the data and wanted to figure out a way to recreate the import files so that some of this clean up that we have to do is automated.
The issue that we have is that the rotations right now do not capture a preceptor. Um, so that when, when we&#39;re trying to target evaluations, if there&#39;s more than one preceptor in our rotation, then the system will assign evaluations for all the preceptors that are linked to it.
So what we have to do is create rotations where there&#39;s one preceptor for each rotation. And so what we did was we took a look at this particular spreadsheet here and did some Excel scripts, uh, created some XXL XL scripts to extract that data and build a metrics compatible import file.
So this first one here, metrics, block schedule, sorry, this one here, metrics, rotation import. And what this is doing is it creates a, it puts a creates a rotation name with the site ID and the rotate, uh, the rotation preceptor&#39;s last name in the rotate.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/21e9d464261b44d1b1b5c9777592f477</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Groups – Figma - 18 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys.

They want to edit it. They click edit and edit in line. They can delete it and we can show a sweet alert that asks them to confirm, um, that they want to, if they want to confirm they wanted to delete it.
If a tag has already been used in a group, um, we can prevent it from, we won&#39;t show the delete button at all.
Um, once the tag is created, when a group is being made, we&#39;ll have a group tax section at the bottom where they can type into it and they can select a tag and use a standard view tree select here for this field, there&#39;ll be able to select one or more tags, um, for that particular group.
And on this table view, we&#39;ll list out the tags, comma separated, um, for each, each, uh, group.

And then if it&#39;s a course evaluation and she goes, don&#39;t even worry about the course evaluation for now. We&#39;ll just do rotation eval.
If it&#39;s, if it&#39;s a Rotation eval, it&#39;ll show the grade book rotation code in that column. And the second thing that we have to add is the student ID number.
And we call that, I think, as in the system, we call it employee ID. We can, um, in the system, in this export, Uh, We can call that, um, Employee slash student ID.
And the key thing is that column would, should only get populated if it&#39;s being exported by someone, with the ability to view confidential data.
So under institutional portal, if I go to programs And administrators, There&#39;s a checkbox review, confidential data.

Um, but I wanted to check with you is If I open up the profile, You&#39;re going to see that there is a blank GME history that we created.
So whenever a new account is created, we&#39;re creating that home institution and then creating a blank, um, Jimmy history here.
So if this is deleted, what I&#39;ve noticed is that the home institution is also getting removed. So I wanted to see, um, I checked with you to see if you&#39;re deleting this, or if you&#39;re editing it, because if you edit it and add a, um, and, um, the details of that training history here, then it will maintain the home institution on the user profile.
So it, this may be the reason why it&#39;s getting a little bored. Cause if, if you, if this gets deleted, the other home institution is also getting deleted from the profile.
So for now, if you have been deleting it, instead of deleting it, maybe you can click edit program and add the new GME history.

So currently we already have the status and due date. Um, and then I added these three sections. Um, what we want to do is expand on this, um, thing that I started and included some other items that I forgot to include.
So you can see the air, Chris posted this screenshot. You can see there&#39;s the data sign, date submitted date view by evaluatee email alert, um, sent date.
So We want to, um, basically create another table like this underneath it that captures the rest of the information that I missed.
And you can also look at it and see how, how we can, um, organize it better. Maybe the top role can be status and all the date related information.
And the second role can be anything related to grades. The grades are going to be calculated in this manner. So we have a form with, let&#39;s say, 20 questions, some of those questions that are going to be graded.
So I added this label here to indicate this graded, and then we can recalculate the average score. And then the tool Tybalt explained to them how the average score is calculated.
The questions included will capture after a number of questions that are included in the grade, and then also percentage of those out of those total questions.
Um, and then, um, and then this one is the total score percentage, see, Sorry, Total score percentage and number of questions.
Um, so this is something that Chris will help write the specs for this part. What we want to do is address the design.
Um, essentially we need to fit in this additional piece of information regarding regarding data sign, date, submitted date, viewed email alert, and break this up into two roles.
So you can send a kind of copy the exact same thing that I have here, put it into two rows and then maybe organize it in a way that you have the status and dates in one role and anything related to, um, grades in the second role.
And then we have these tags here to indicate that this question is a graded question.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/77f3c03e6bf24e3da2cc9875cf0e109e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 2 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So the purpose of this task is to address a permissions problem. If we go into curriculum And curriculum permissions, we have the ability to set full permissions for view or edit for any user in the system.
And then in addition to that, we also have the ability to add people to the schedule. So if I&#39;m part of the anatomy course, I can add a director or I can add them as groups here.
And what we want to do is make a change to the calendar on the personal portal. So currently, if I log in as A student coordinator user notice that I&#39;m on the MSU com a metrics database.
And if I log in as a student coordinator, um, And go to the calendar page, you can see here, I can see all the core schedules here.
I can turn it off on and boot on the calendar. This person does not have any permissions over the courses.
So she should not be seeing Those schedules. I&#39;m gonna go back to the admin side And go to curriculum, set up Good permissions.
It&#39;s their search for student coordinator. This is the name of the user. In addition to the role being the student coordinator, we also named it as student named this person, a student coordinator, you see, there&#39;s, there&#39;s no permission is turned on.
And if I go to the courses and rotations page, And if we scroll down under the director, this person is not added to any of these courses as a director So we need to make sure that on the personal Porter portal, under calendar, we only show the list of the courses if they have permissions to view them.
So if they&#39;ve been given view or edit permissions under curriculum setup, Curriculum permissions, if they have either either of these checkboxes turned on, they&#39;ll be able to see all of the courses listed in that multi-select.
If they&#39;ve only been added to specific courses as directors, then they&#39;ll only be able to see the courses they&#39;ve been given permission to.
If they&#39;re given both, if they&#39;re given the view only access to the entire course or edit permission to the entire, sorry, if they&#39;ve been given view and edit permissions to the entire curriculum and did they&#39;ve been added to the director for one or two courses, the permission for the entire curriculum will take a priority and there&#39;ll be able to see entire curriculum.
So there&#39;s those three scenarios. First they&#39;ve been added to the entire curriculum as either view or edit. And in that case, they&#39;ll see all the courses listed.
If they, they can also be added. Second cases is, have been added to the course of rotation individually, as directors.
And there&#39;ll be able to see the ones that they have permissions over. And the third scenario is they&#39;re added both as a curriculum admin here, and they&#39;ve been added as a course admin.
So in that scenario, if they, the, uh, full permissions will take priority and there&#39;ll be able to see all the courses.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5db7560cf3684106b4ac1aeaa454345d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - Week of June 19, 2022 - 23 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So want to explain this design so that he can finish it up, essentially what we&#39;re adding here. This is the pop-up that comes up on the evaluations and assignments page.
If you open up a, uh, submitted evaluation, um, or if you&#39;re trying to complete an evaluation on the personal portal, we will see this top section.
What I added here was this thing here that shows the, uh, submitted status, um, due date, average score questions included, um, total score percentage.
And you can see here that we have the tool tips here with the explanations. Um, we can check the grammar of these and make sure it&#39;s correct.
Um, and then Chris commented on this and said, my design didn&#39;t include all the things that we need to include.
And he&#39;s right here. You see here that there&#39;s the date assigned date, submitted, uh, date viewed by evaluate T um, and the email alert.
So we want to incorporate those items into here. Maybe have a second role, um, so that it&#39;s, so it&#39;s not going to be all squished.
So we have a, another role like this and put this information in there. Um, you can also look at, look at it to see how to organize this better.
Maybe put all the Date stuff together with the status and then put the, um, grade data, which has average score questions included and total percentage on the separate one.
So basically the top role can be all, all the dates and statuses and second row can be anything about grades.
Um, and then I also added this section here for graded questions. So essentially what we&#39;re doing is giving them the ability to say certain questions that are going to be graded.
And when the evaluation is submitted, we calculate this score. Um, tell them which of the question, uh, which of the questions are included in the grading and the total score percentage.
And another thing that Chris mentioned here is, um, for percentage. So in addition to where is this, uh, in addition to showing questions included, we also want to show a percentage.
So let&#39;s say this is a 16 out of 20 questions, 20 questions on the form. 69 of them is being graded.
Um, then we would put that as like in the PR before that it&#39;d be like 85%. Um, and then 16 slash 20.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ba00b83a30274d9ba8ae25c8320619c3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 4 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>MRA now.

And If I go into this page, click edit, we have the apps, any admin say pediatrics selected here. But if the client goes into this, uh, section and they see this blank entry, they&#39;re likely going to delete this because it&#39;s something that was automatically loaded to the system.

So I wanted to send you this video and document to clarify some of the discussions that we had internally or communicate that some of these discussions we have internally to regarding, um, compensation adjustments for three people, Chris Rio and myself, and the reason, uh, we had these discussions yesterday, these discussions actually happened, uh, a few months ago, but we didn&#39;t get a chance to formally put this into contract and make any changes.
So before we do that, we&#39;re hoping that you can review this and see if you have any suggestions or anything that you want to adjust to.
Um, so that it&#39;s, it&#39;s, uh, okay with the investment that you&#39;re planning. So for the first four years of our contract with metrics, all of us had shares that were being vested.
And then afterwards, we were supposed to have a, some adjustment once those shares stopped vesting. Um, but we&#39;ve been busy with trying to grow the company.
We haven&#39;t really made any changes. And then last September, uh, as we started taking on some of these larger onboarding projects and spending a lot of time, um, getting them up and running, we had a meeting to discuss salary adjustments and some roll changes.
So I formally took on the CEO role. Uh, Chris switched to the CIO role and then REO took on the seat Tio role.
And, uh, at that time we were trying to figure out what is a way to make an adjustment on our salary without putting an additional burden on the, um, company cashflow and came up with a creative way to do that.
Um, the it&#39;s a little odd, you know, nontraditional, but the, everybody agreed to it. Um, so the, the plan was to, um, make a salary adjustment that is more to, uh, a market rate and having the SA the cash component stay the same, but we add on a raise as debt so that each month some more debt is getting added.
And until the company hits, uh, one or two milestones, either at 1.2 by five in ARR or raises 500 K in investment, then at that point, it would fully turn to cash compensation and any accrued debt will be paid off in increments of thousand dollars per month.
And from the other debt that we have with novel and Ben Franklin, we were, we&#39;re going to include that in our contract saying this debt is going to be subjugated to those outstanding debt to novel and Franklin.
And, uh, um, it would only be paid off after those debt is prioritized. So, and then there is an interest rate calculated annually once at the end of each year.
So this was the structure for this. And I put that here. Um, so this document contains like what our salary, how much money we&#39;ve taken out, uh, each year along with, uh, this adjustment that we&#39;re thinking about.
And we had these discussions back in October, but we haven&#39;t taken out anything and we haven&#39;t officially signed any contracts.
We&#39;ve been so busy. So it would be ideal if we can apply this, uh, from when the role change took place.
Um, but if there is an issue with that, then, um, uh, we can, we would just have to do this going forward.
Um, but let us know. So these are all the details for that. And if, if there&#39;s any questions I can hop on a call and, um, get into it a little bit more detail.
So thank you so much.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ee2f59ad1cac483d8d5633dee1b7430c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MedtricsLab - Key Member Compensation - Google Docs - 17 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So I wanted to send you this video and document to clarify a few things about the salary changes.
Um, so back in October, when we started onboarding some of our larger clients and, um, the, uh, the bigger contracts that we got for a Talem, we had an internal meeting about responsibilities, changing some roles, um, and then also about everybody&#39;s compensation.
So for many years we&#39;ve been kind of just in the weeds and going through things, and haven&#39;t really adjusted our salaries.
So in, for Chris, myself, and Rio, we had a four year vesting period and all three of us had the vesting period and, and didn&#39;t really have any, uh, compensation adjustment.
So this discussion and at that time was for October 1st onwards. Um, we would have a different role. Like I assumed the role of CEO formerly and Chris switched to CIO role.
And, um, Rio had the role changed the CTO. Um, we didn&#39;t really sign any contracts and we didn&#39;t really have anything finalized, but the discussions that we had was this is I sort of outlined it here.
Um, and I want to share them with you because before we want to put this into a contract and, uh, put it in place officially.
Um, but before we do that, we want to make sure that you guys are okay with what&#39;s in here. And if you have any tweaks you wanted to suggest we can incorporate that and then share the final contract.
So Chris is, um, the compensation was 57 per year. And, um, the, the, um, the planned adjustment here was 4 88 to 88,200, but since we don&#39;t have the cash to pay, um, all of that at once, what we thought was we can do a salary of 4,400 plus 2,600 debt that gets added to the company.
And once we hit a milestone of 1.25 in ARR, or raise at least 500 K investment, we would switch to all cash compensation and then pay off any Val, any outstanding balance at thousand dollars per month until it&#39;s fully paid off.
So this will allow us to have that compensation adjustment, um, be ideal to have it starting in October 1st when the role change took place and then, um, uh, make that adjustment and make everybody happy.
Um, but the company will be able to operate at the current cashflow and then catch up on that debt later from a novel and Ben Franklin perspective, we were going to write this into the contract that the team debt will be subjugated to novel and Ben Franklin, so that, um, payments to team members will only happen, um, after any Ben Franklin payments have been, uh, addressed.
So I&#39;ve outlined the, um, that in this document for myself. So for Chris Rio and myself, and shows their current, uh, uh, rate as well as was the proposed rate, and then, um, current rate and then the proposed rate for adjustment along with the, what the cash compensation is and what the debt, um, repayment that the debt would would be.
So hopefully this makes sense. If not, I can provide, I can hop on a call and explain this to you a little bit more detail.
It is a little weird, um, but I&#39;m hoping that it will allow us to continue, um, with, uh,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8d2779ca8f19451793607a4ff084d68b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 4 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey marina.

So the first thing that I mentioned about the AI modeling machine learning, modeling, um, that&#39;s more of a long-term thing that we&#39;re thinking about how to grow our platform in a more intelligent way so that the yes, I believe it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s more of a, um, um, The, it is a recommendation engine.
Um, so it&#39;s like a sentiment analysis, um, of texts so that they can identify, um, different ways to, um, prioritize the feedback that the trainees are getting select.
For example, if a student got a really bad comment that saying they&#39;re unprofessional, um, right now, unless the Dean actually looks at that evaluation, they may not see it.
Um, but if we can say, Hey, this person said this and put it on top of their list and alert them, then that would save them a lot of time.
There&#39;s also other ways that that was just one example. Um, there&#39;s other ways that I was thinking that we can try to scale in the future, um, so that the platform becomes more intelligent and not just a database with, um, report that we&#39;re printing out.
They have to look at. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s a longterm, um, thing that I can discuss with you at the next meeting and brainstorm some ideas with you.
Um, but the more immediate thing that I&#39;m talking about, the optimization, um, we&#39;re actually getting ready to start a project, uh, with, uh, um, a couple of, uh, developers that we&#39;ve worked in the past.
And the idea there is to, um, build, let me see if I can pull up. Um, So they have different, uh, courses they have to complete that are offered certain weeks.
They&#39;re different slots that are have allocated for each of those days where you can have up to 14, 16 students with a minimum of 14, uh, in order for the class to be offered, then they may have this taking place at a certain location.
The then there&#39;s requirements as to students must complete this lab, at least once, um, some of them they have to complete, um, multiple days.
And there&#39;s also some student preferences they may have to factor in as they want to do certain number of electives.
Um, so there&#39;s a whole bunch of, um, what does that constraints that needs to be in? And it&#39;s basically a constrained problem.
And so our platform will be used to develop the, the constraints. The school would use an interface to build everything and be a, an API, which send that data to Google or tools where the constraints are, uh, entered into different, um, functions.
And then the optimizer would run and generate an output, um, that will be scheduled for each of the students that, um, optimize these constraints.
And, uh, and then our system would put that into a schedule that is published to the students. So that&#39;s the more immediate thing they&#39;re working on.
Um, we haven&#39;t started it, but I&#39;m curious, uh, what experience you had with this kind of, uh, a constraint problem and, uh, that&#39;s, that&#39;s independent of the machine learning on that, that I can get into.
Um, later, this is a more of an urgent thing that we&#39;re trying to deploy for a client, uh, by later this year,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/905d29e170c54c138287b850f0a57552</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Optimizer.xlsx - Google Sheets - 28 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hello. I wanted to review this a spreadsheet to give you an overview of what the expectations are for this optimizer.
So for this, uh, optimizer, we&#39;re going to be creating something for a school that has a few hundred students that needs to be scheduled into different courses.
Some of those courses are mandatory. Some are elective, and for the mandatory courses, they have to attend all of them.
And they are offered different times of the week, along a 13 week semester. So if you look at this first one, it says Bullvine it&#39;s offered weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, and seven and weeks nine through 13 on Mondays.
So every Monday on weeks three through seven and nine to 13, this is offered and the students have to attend one slot one Monday out of any of these Mondays to fulfill the requirements for the first class.
So all they have to do is attend one Monday. They don&#39;t have to attend every Monday. And for each of those slots, there are minimum that is required and maximum that is allowed.
There&#39;s also going to be, um, some where you have to attend all slots during any given week. So this primary care rotation is offered weeks one through 13 and Monday through Friday.
So if they are scheduled, they have to be scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday slots for, uh, to complete the requirement there.
And it has to be in the same week here, same, uh, constraint here attend all slots for any given week.
This is offered Monday and Thursday and the students have to attend one Monday and one Thursday I&#39;m in the same week to fulfill the requirement.
Then there are some complicated constraints here. Each pair of students will need to form a group with another pair and be scheduled four times in the same, same group of pairs.
So here they&#39;re going to be, the system is going to be creating groups of two, and those groups are going to be scheduled, um, into this surgery, anesthesia physical.
And once that is scheduled, they have to be scheduled into the surgery, Um, tend to for 25 days afterwards. So if I&#39;m on week one for the physical, then I have to be 10 to 14 days after that for the surgery and anesthesia.
And this has to happen, um, Twice for the surgery and, uh, anesthesia physical, and then once for each of these And then for electives.
So electives, our students are going to be submitting a list of electives they want to be in and rank order.
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and east of these, um, electives. We&#39;re going to go through and try to maximize the student preferences. So if a student submits the rank list that has 10 electric courses, we always want to try to hit within the top three, what they&#39;re scheduled into.
So acupuncture, they have to schedule once, Um, on a Thursday to fulfill the requirement Monday, they&#39;re going to have to schedule advanced medicine again and to fulfill once.
So if this is offered four times during the semester, they only have to be scheduled once to complete the requirement.
But again, unlike the mandatory courses for electives, they only have to complete one elective. They&#39;re gonna, this is going to be one elective out of the rank list that they provide.
So each student provides a list of ones that are interested in we&#39;re going to pick picking one and scheduling it based on the rules for that one core one, a course.
So this one, uh, Terry, this lab has to be scheduled once a week. So this is something that all students have to take and ask to be scheduled.
Once a week, Then we have Castro, the surgery labs, surgery labs are going to be scheduled in groups of four.
And those four, those students has to be stayed together for the entire semester. And there has to be 14 days between surgeries.
So if I&#39;m scheduled for This first one, I can only be scheduled for another surgery 14 days after my first date.
So if I&#39;m on Tuesday of week three, I would not be scheduled for another surgery on this until The fifth a week five for the next surgery.
So these are different surgery labs. And, uh, once I&#39;m scheduled for one has to be 14 days before another surgery scheduled.
And there&#39;s also a couple of minor. I missed a couple of other constraints within that. For example, There must be even number of groups per lab, And students must avoid being scheduled to the primary.
Um, so if they&#39;re scheduled for surgery in one week, we also have to avoid scheduling this course Anyway. So that&#39;s, uh, some of these constraints are complex and we could try to program them before in advance before the optimizer runs.
Um, but we&#39;re hoping that, um, most of them can be captured in the optimizer.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/98fb21bd76174648a66eed4c3103b60e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Faculty Onboarding - Google Docs - 17 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So the guides are really good. And, uh, I wanted to give you some general feedback that can help for the future.
One to cut down on the, uh, language a little bit. Um, so there&#39;s two things that I, uh, I feel like I&#39;m not, can you give me some insight?
The first is when it comes to these faculty members, looking at these guides, you want to sort of focus the topics on things they have to do.
So how do access metrics is a perfect example of that&#39;s, uh, helpful. Um, and then the calendar page, like, we don&#39;t need to say page page, so we can just say, um, my profile or setting up your profile.
And then, Um, I think for the calendar, the main thing was, um, Sync. And then these logs page, there that&#39;s a faculty they review in case log, still review student case logs.
Now evaluations, um, Review and complete evaluations. That&#39;s what they&#39;re doing on that page. And For review page on the left navigation, this one I actually took out since that&#39;s the fixture feature doesn&#39;t exist.
And then for this one, go to directory page on the left navigation, that, that doesn&#39;t really tell them what they&#39;re doing there.
So it would be Six review student evaluation and profile. And then for some of the other language that your content is, uh, it is a thorough, the, the things that I tweaked is, um, just cutting down on some of the text so that we can say it with less words.
So for example, there, um, case logs, modular entries allow students to patient mean, look, I added that. Um, so on the cases page can say there are two tabs, uh, choose from.
So basically this is saying the same thing. Um, cause this is a FA this is a document for the faculty.
So we don&#39;t need to, uh, repeatedly say that the faculty can view on a pending tab. Um, You all case logs that have been linked to this students that are part of your practicum course and that needs to be approved.
Um, so yeah, so those are the tweaks that I made and essentially the, uh, you know, trying to get the message across with less text.
So because as a faculty who&#39;s busy, um, they want to be able to scan the document quickly, find out what sections, um, are relevant to them and then get the information using the formatting, like such as bold and things to highlight certain things, because they&#39;re not going to read this cover to cover most of the time they&#39;re going to be scrolling and looking for information and being scanning.
Um, and then the less words and more, um, we definitely needed enough words, provide context, but it&#39;s a balance between the words and the, the images too, and the formatting to, uh, pinpoint exactly what they need to get out of it.
Um, let&#39;s see. Yeah. So th those are the minor tweaks that I made. Um, let&#39;s See. So this one here, The directory page, we want to bold directory, anything that is like a click roll bang or something in the metrics.
It&#39;s good to bold. It Can be accessed from the left menu. It shows a list of students. Um, She, here we can combine this.
It shows Students that are enrolled in your practicum course in one central place. Then by clicking on the profile button, faculty can see the profile demographic details and so on, and then Completed on the student.
So I didn&#39;t the one part I did. I did a leave out, is that the case logs? Because I didn&#39;t after reviewing it, I realized that the case logs page on this doesn&#39;t really provide them with enough context.
And it&#39;s better for them to stick to this top process for reviewing case logs. Um, all right. So that&#39;s mainly the thing that I wanted to share.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2c647c8301e64c64a1809d4613ae1c78</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Message - 10 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>All right. So here I&#39;m testing a tools issue here. So this, from what he&#39;s describing in the objectives tab he&#39;s doing, I told her working on the curriculum.
So first issue here, we have adding space between buttons. So if we go here, search inspect, so he fixed it so that the buttons don&#39;t stack on top of each other, like it was before second, this fix button issue, you can see here that the spacing is off.
So all we can do is make sure that it&#39;s consistently. So I need to pick another one with more courses.
So here are the buttons look the same across all of them. So when there&#39;s, what was happening here was when there&#39;s two lines of texts, it was messing up the button formatting.
So now if we have two lines of texts, um, the buttons look similar for all of them, because even if it&#39;s one row of text, he&#39;s adding some spacing here at the bottom, so that it looks consistent.
All right, that&#39;s good. On the response, responsive issue and click on an object. So on mobile, it looks like under content, instead of breaking out of this, you can scroll sideways Before what I was doing is breaking out of the screen.
So that&#39;s good. Number four, same thing here. You can scroll within it instead of it breaking out of the cell, number five.
So saying one result when there&#39;s no results. Um, so let&#39;s try that. We&#39;ll choose a feature academic year and it, it, it, uh, it&#39;s updated to have zero assaults.
That&#39;s good, uh, name not showing on the chart or graph. So what we&#39;re going to do is back to curriculum, search, click, expand.
So I&#39;m not really sure it looks the same. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s anything to be changed here. So let that pass.
And I&#39;ve tested this on the admin portal. Now, what I also want to do is make sure I test it on the personal portal system, set up curriculum permissions.
Will we give Christopher truck full curriculum access truck go to, okay. Cherif at Turk is a resident. So he was not going to have access.
Let&#39;s do trucks, personal portal, curriculum search. I do the same thing. Go on mobile. Okay. So that looks like the same changes are applied here, content.
Okay. So all of these changes look good.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c547053cb3b640b78e8be36f9d453999</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Quartiles - Google Docs - 13 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey marina. So The LA the two remaining charges that we have are the core tile charts. And this includes the competency chart, as well as the GPA course I&#39;ll chart.
And I believe we can accomplish both with the, um, one set of specs. The only difference is going to be that one.
We need to have two chart types, one for competencies. And second one where we&#39;re selecting data set from the, a exam score again.
So I&#39;m gonna focus on the competency one first and did some research. And based on what I&#39;m finding is that it&#39;s best for us to use this num PI library to calculate this since that&#39;s what it&#39;s specifically made for.
And, um, so what we&#39;re going to do is I&#39;ll walk through this chart design first. So new chart, same thing as before, I&#39;m going to have a competency quartiles chart and then chart setting for x-axis.
We&#39;re going to choose the competencies, and this is coming from our milestones competency set. So we&#39;re going to be, we&#39;re basically going to be selecting the core competencies.
Um, So Review this real quick. So these core competencies, patient care, medical knowledge, we&#39;re going to be pulling this and displaying it there, and then metrics back.
And we have the averages for these milestones calculated, and we&#39;ll be using those to create the charts. So I&#39;m sure, uh, David or Chris can provide more details on where they&#39;re stored.
Um, let&#39;s go to, so once we get that, sorry, uh, once we get that, we&#39;re going to select this for the X axis, we&#39;re going to give it to the label so that a lot, that&#39;ll define the label for the x-axis and the I&#39;m sorry, x-axis down here, which is going to be competencies and Y axis.
We&#39;re going to set a start value and an interval. So that&#39;ll say what the stock value is. So it would be one interval of one and label chart size and range, the same, the trainee&#39;s average marker color.
That&#39;s going to highlight the trainees average in whatever color they select, and then the fill color, if they want to fill this up with anything other than white.
And then the chart is going to be stored in a specific document category, like the other chart, and for actually generating this chart.
Here&#39;s what I found so far. Um, we can use the &lt;inaudible&gt; library to calculate this, and the num PI level really allow you to take an array of numbers and then calculate the first, second, third, and fourth, um, Kwon tiles easily by using these, uh, functions.
And once that is calculated, the first, second, and third and fourth, uh, calculated, we can then, um, calculate the, with the, uh, the whiskers or the outliers.
So Q1 Q3, or the intercourse, intercourse L range, and then the outliers are calculated using this formula and this formula minimum, the maximum.
So the non-par library allows us to do this. You calculate the first and third quartiles, and then once you do that, you can, uh, you can use this function to calculate the, uh, actual upper bound, lower bound And I put the links to the, to the articles that I found at the bottom.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c60baa1ee0264d23a8b3ea9fb6b9bb4c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 27 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Kevin is Tasha. Chris is out today. So I was working with Mike on this and wanted to provide some more context.
So when you, when you have a semester rollover, you have a couple of options here. For course groups and session groups, you could, um, um, roll them over and keep the same groups linked to those courses.
Or you can create new groups and populate them with students. So when you, this, uh, keeping the same groups is, is typically, uh, would only be useful if you want to have the same students in, uh, in the, in, in that group and the next semester, because you&#39;re keeping the students in that group.
Also, what you&#39;re likely doing is creating new groups with the same names in the next academic year. So the historical data is going to stay the same and the students are going to, uh, remain in that group.
And in the next semester you have a copy of the existing groups. And so in that scenario, evaluations will work fine because you have two separate groups.
The first one will have the students for the current semester and the copy for the next a semester, you&#39;ll be populating with new set of students.
So as long as it&#39;s done as create new groups and, uh, with the same names, then it should be fine to go ahead and set everything up for the next semester.
And the current evils will work fine. And you can, uh, uh, you can also do that on the staging server and confirm that you&#39;re happy with the way the groups are copied over.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/df76fb36615049c69c19117c5c8eba11</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Faculty Onboarding - Google Docs - 17 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike.

Um, cut down on some of the, the text to make it more concise. Um, so this, this documentation is for faculty.
Um, we can, so we don&#39;t need to refer to it as, as faculty member, many places. Um, so that will cut down on some of the words and then on this tab, um, So we already say this is about me tab, so we can just do a view evaluations that we&#39;re having submitted by the individuals, therefore other individuals.

So this a task. I had a meeting with, uh, everybody and went over, um, the task and we have some feedback.
I&#39;m going to be putting a second loom video here with the tweaks. Um, so instead of listing out these course names like I did initially, um, we&#39;re going to simplify that by having three types of grade book blocks, and it&#39;s going to be rotations, which will pull in all rotation grades that the student has.
If it says rotation, not mandatory, we&#39;ll pull in all the rotation grades that are, um, mandatory. And if, um, for the third one, if, if they want an elective section, we can also have, And elective section where it really put in the grades for electives, and we&#39;re always going to be listed out chronologically.
So if they create this section here with the first grade grade book block type and have a table with those fields in here, When the document is generated, we&#39;re going to do a query of the grade book pull in anything that has rotation grades, and it will, um, Any, any, uh, grades with the rotation type.
And it will list those, um, grades out in the table with each of these fields out for each grade. So if this was getting filled out, it will be internal medicine is the name of the rotation.
The honors is the clerkship grade grade book, revise comment. We&#39;ll have the comments from there, the chart where we don&#39;t have that built yet, but in ultimately we&#39;re going to have a chart that&#39;s linked to that.
Great, also, So this is the, uh, change that we&#39;re making. We&#39;re sticking with these three types and we&#39;re not going to list out each of the courses.
The second change we&#39;re making is for the naming structure instead of hard coding. Uh, what I wrote in here, you can look at what is in the backend and try to name it according to the model and field names that we have.
Um, so I think this may be a great book user schedule. Um, so if there&#39;s a way to match what&#39;s in the system, Um, In the backend similar to the way that we do on Django templates, we can use that here also.
So that is matching what&#39;s in the backend. Um, if it&#39;s, if it doesn&#39;t make sense from a syntax standpoint, for the, for it to do it on the front end, we can target it.
But the first thing that we want to try to do is match what&#39;s in the what&#39;s in the backend. So it&#39;s easy for us to troubleshoot in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b14e87c37b964f3389b35c82b01fdcf0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE - Gradeblock - Google Docs - 21 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey marina. So I spoke with, uh, everybody and got some feedback and wanted to give you an update on this.
So we&#39;re going to move forward with this task, and essentially it&#39;s going to work the same way that we talked about with some tweaks here.
Um, we were, we will give them the ability to insert these blocks that are going to be looped through as part of the document generation.
And it&#39;s the changes that I want to talk about here is the first thing is instead of defining the courses as part of the block, uh, we&#39;ll have three separate grade block.
I mean, uh, I&#39;m going to call this, um, It Brooks blocks and versus going to be rotations Now I&#39;d like you to, um, Yeah.
Um, name these based on what&#39;s on the backend. I think I&#39;m trying to think I&#39;m I&#39;m, I think I&#39;m accurate here, but you can come up with tech, so we&#39;ll have three different types of blocks.
So you could, um, we&#39;re going to start off with great book, that rotations that&#39;s going to be the opening block and the naming structure is going to be the same as old merge fields.
And then there&#39;s going to be an block with a slash here. And when the document is generated for a specific student, we&#39;re going to go to the database and pull up all rotation grades that the student has and populate each of the fields that they have in here.
And we&#39;ll have a separate table created one after each other for every grade that they have. And the naming structures.
A second thing that we need to address is w instead of, uh, using what I have here, I&#39;d like you to look at the backend and, um, name these according to the models and fields names that we have, so that we&#39;re keeping that consistent with the backend.
So it&#39;s clear for everybody from when we&#39;re setting this up. So we&#39;ll have grade book dot rotations as the opening tag.
And when we look this up, we&#39;re going to have great book that graded course rotation name, grade book. Um, I don&#39;t remember if this was a, This would be, probably be Score status maybe.
Um, but essentially it will be module name, model, field, or module name, model, model. If it&#39;s going to be for something that is for the, um, that we&#39;re going to loop through.
So we have Um, great block rotations for it will pull up all grade block, all grades rotation grades for green block rotations on mandatory.
It&#39;ll pull in all rotations that are mandatory. This will pull in all, um, rotations that are elective</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/87619b22c70248e5bccef49a8ca65fad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem MSPE Graph Explanations.xlsx - Google Sheets - 6 June 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So marina in this chart, we&#39;re going to be creating aggregate, um, in this, uh, testimony to create an aggregate charts that combines data from multiple courses.
So you can see here that these are the different courses or a selection on the chart template. And for each chart template, we&#39;re also defining that it&#39;s going to be count and the number of counts or Number of, uh, or the percentage.
And it&#39;s gonna show the great statuses and a separate bars. And one of the things that&#39;s unique here is we cannot get away with just changing the color of the bar to what the students, uh, is like we did.
And the other one, because we have multiple bars. And if we change this to a different color for the student, and it may not make sense.
So instead we need to keep the color of the grade status and then maybe put a label above it or something that, uh, that indicates that it&#39;s the student&#39;s grade.
So if we look at anatomy, we have honors pass fail, and you can see that the arrow is over the pass.
So that&#39;s what the student received Same way in, uh, embryology, the student received honors. So we have to figure out some way to mark the bar that is equivalent to the student&#39;s grade.
Um, aside from that, a workflow is going to be very similar. We create new new chart, and when you click new char to give it a name, go to title, given it a subtitle, and we&#39;re going to select aggregate chart.
And once you select that, it&#39;s going to allow us to select multiple courses. And it&#39;s going to create one chart with all of those courses, percentage or accounts with the label and the size of the bar chart.
And in this case, we&#39;re going to, um, we&#39;re going to, um, we&#39;re going to, um, show multiple options here for each grade status that exists.
We&#39;re going to have a different color they can pick. So if there&#39;s honors, I&#39;ll update this, uh, design to show that let&#39;s see if we can do that now, going to list out.
So we&#39;re going to highlight the different, uh, uh, bars and different color, and then put a label or some sort of indicator above the bar that is, that represents a student that we generated the chart for.
So once it&#39;s a saved, if we go back to generate chart, it&#39;s going to bring up this model, allows us to select a group of students.
And when you click generate is going to create a chart like this for each student where it shows you each of the different bars, um, for the great status and for each of the courses that we selected, and then we&#39;ll add a label above it to indicate the student&#39;s grade.
Maybe we can even, um, I have to think about this a little bit. Um, yeah, I mean, maybe we can try showing there And it shows above it.
So that indicates that&#39;s what that person&#39;s greatest. And if that&#39;s possible, that&#39;d be great. If not, we&#39;ll have to get creative with it, but we don&#39;t want it to change the color of a bar for each.
Is it like iffy? If the training got passed on anatomy, if we show that as a different color and then for biochemistry, if they&#39;ve got honors and they show that as a different color, it&#39;s going to get confusing.
So it&#39;s better to keep these colors consistent and then put a label above it. Uh, please let me know if you have any questions.

So for this particular task, this is going to be partly a research issue. And, um, the purpose of this task is to figure out if we can use high charts, which we use for creating charts and metrics that we can render multiple PNG files quickly.
Um, so they have a way to download PNG of a chart. But what we need to do is have different charts in the system, and we have to generate a large number of PNG files for different students, and then be able to insert them into documents.
So this task, what we&#39;re going to do is look into their server side rendering tools. Um, so if you&#39;re looking at this page, It&#39;s, uh, allows us to render charts in bulk.
And, um, so for, for us to be able to use this, we have to first figure out if this works and if it does work, what I would like, what I&#39;m going to do is have a follow-up task where we actually take student data and generate a large number of charts and that&#39;s added to their account.
And then we&#39;ll use that to generate documents similar to the way that you did the last task. So first part is setting up this, uh, library they provide, and you may need a geese help for this.
And once it&#39;s done Creating a simple page under documents called charts, and we want to show a demo, um, chart here, maybe we can copy and paste from their demo library here, one of these charts.
And then we want to specify the width of this chart that we wanted, uh, uh, generated pixels when we export it as a PNG.
So if I type in a number here that would allow me to specify the width of the PNG, the height will be defined by what the width is to make sure that its proportional roles going to pick up roles from the system, let&#39;s say PGY one or PUI two, and then select the document type for where to store the images.
So what&#39;s going to happen is when I click generate PNG files, it&#39;s going to generate that same PNG files multiple times and attach it to that User&#39;s profile Under documents certification, and it&#39;s going to add it as a file under the appropriate document type.
So it&#39;s going to have a categorized under the appropriate document type. And the name of that file is going to be the same as the file name and I&#39;ll have it attached here.
So, so we&#39;re testing out whether this plugin works and if it does work on and, um, we&#39;re going to try to generate these files and then put it into the, uh, documents, a certification on just specific documents because in the larger project, this is what we&#39;re going to be trying to do with specific parameters of what they need to put on the chart.

So if you have, uh, worked with this feature, the way that it works is under institutional poor merch fields, we can create these merch fields.
And one of the merch fields that we can create is a system field where we can insert different fields from the database.
What we wanna do is add a, um, field here that says, um, user photo. And then in parentheses say, um, image, um, image file.
And once this is set up and saved, um, we can also, we can also, um, remove this section. If a user photo is selected, here will hide the editable section, cuz they&#39;re not gonna be able to edit the photo in the system.
And once it&#39;s saved, they&#39;re going to be able to go to the templates, edit a template, go have manage, or merch fields enable that merch field.
They just created go to manage content and then insert the merch field into here using this insert functionality. And it&#39;s gonna look something like this, whatever the name is and they&#39;re gonna save it.
And then on the program admin portal, they go to templates, select the template, select a person and generate the document when they generate the document, we&#39;re going to insert that users photo.
So if I&#39;m generating for Allison, it&#39;s gonna insert Allison&#39;s photo in there. And for the size of that photo, we&#39;re gonna use whatever photo size she has in there.
Um, the width and width and height. And the key thing here is that once these documents are generated, they&#39;re going to be available for PDF download.

So this is, um, a sample of what it looks like. This is not something that&#39;s accessible from the client side, but we will work on a report that can be exported from the system, but this kind of shows you what it looks like.
We have the name of the resident, the rotation, and the, um, start date and end date. And when it was, um, updated and who updated it.
So you can see that the action was addition and it was done by a metrics admin. And if I scroll down here, you can see, um, for example, this entry here, we have a edit where the old dates were updated to a different set of dates.
And then there&#39;s also delete. So Perry Cox are one of the admins, went and deleted a block schedule assignment. So this information is captured in the system.

So this is going to be an upgrade to our great book functionality that we&#39;ve been working on. And first we&#39;re going to start off with some permissions, and this is building off of 3, 6, 3 9.
So this task should only be done after 3, 6, 3 9 is first. And the first thing that we&#39;re going to do, sorry, we&#39;re going to do is, um, add, uh, 3, 6, 3, 9, adding a permission to manage grade book from the personal portal.
And what we&#39;re going to do with this one is add a way to give individuals the ability to enter grades for specific groups of individual students.
So we&#39;re going to have a, um, We&#39;re basically what we can do is, um, use the functionality from 3, 6, 3 9, and we&#39;ll give, um, the may another field called groups and there&#39;ll be able to select all the groups that they want to give, um, access to.
So the current functionality that we did on 3 6, 3, 9, and we&#39;ll Have a, What other radio button. So the current functionality is going to be like this, and they can select all students, which is the 3, 6, 3, 9 tasks, or they can select specific groups of students.
And if they&#39;re given this permission, then in the personal portal, they&#39;ll be able to see the grade book and see the rotation grades and course grades tab.
And if you click add score, it will bring up model with the person dropped down, will only show the students that they have permissions for.
So that&#39;s the first part. And then the second part is when we&#39;re adding, um, rotation grades, we have a way to include comments here.
And what we&#39;re adding is a second comment field. So rename the, uh, original, the, the comment field that we have there to original comment.
And then we&#39;ll add a second comment field called edited comment. And this is going to get added to the comment section as when you click save comment.
And then the last part, this is on the evaluations assignments page. If I go here and I open a submitted, submitted a evaluation response is gone.
We&#39;re going to add a section to the bottom that allows us to the existing re um, sign and review evaluation.
We&#39;re going to rename that to review and sign and have an expand and collapse button. And when you click expand for the add great functionality, it&#39;ll bring up this window.
This is going to be very similar to our grade book here. So you can see here, this looks identical to this, um, except for we already have the person and the schedule on the evaluation that we&#39;re looking at.
So if I go to the evaluation assignment and click a few most recent response, you&#39;ll see that the name, the schedule, all that is in here.
So what&#39;s what happens here is this gets populated with it, the schedule information, they evaluate her information and then four weeks we&#39;re going to auto calculate this and then allow them to edit it.
So by looking at July 1st to July 28th and dividing the number of days by seven, we&#39;ll get the weeks and then we&#39;ll round it off to the nearest, uh, and the, the first decimal place, I should say, uh, first two decimal places by default.
And then they can, uh, edit that if they like, then here, this is going to show the graded courses rotation.
So that&#39;s going to be from curriculum set up graded course rotations. And it&#39;s going to show a list of all the courses and rotations that are in the system and the graded course rotations.
And they can select one, the submission date, this your default to today&#39;s date, the score, the status, the type, then down here for comments, we&#39;re going to have original comment and then revise comment again.
When a grade is saved, it&#39;ll show that. And then we&#39;re also going to be adding an import functionality that allows us to import the grades.
So if I click import, it&#39;s going to bring up a model and I can download a template, which is going to be attached to the good lab file.
And once, once I re upload it back, it can either successfully import, or it&#39;s going to give an error message.
And it&#39;s going to show a download lock button, which will download a CSV file. And then for every role that has a problem, it&#39;s going to ha add an extra column that says error so that the user can go in there and correct the columns that have errors.
So this is, uh, a few different items. Um, if we need to break this up, we can break it up, but it&#39;s, I&#39;m okay to do it in one task so that we can test through the full workflow.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/61840b4b6c5143df9037c4b365b178bd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Message - 21 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So when it comes to rotations, there are a few things that are connected to it. So we can take a look at this diagram and go through it.
So first is rotations are linked to a site, so it can be one of the affiliated hospitals that KP works with.
Each rotation has a link to that site. RO rotations also have rotation supervisors. These are the individuals that will receive, uh, evaluation assignments based on the schedule.
So if anybody that is evaluating the, uh, the resident should be added as a rotation supervisor. So the system can match up evaluations.
In special instances, there may be rotation directors or administrators. If you, if your program is collecting any sort of summative evaluation where these individuals need to see what other, uh, attendings set about that, uh, trainee, um, or summative evaluation form can be used to, uh, show what the other attending said.
And then the director can submit a submit, submit evaluation. A rotation director must also be included as a rotation supervisor for that to work.
Um, this is something that we can discuss in more detail, if necessary with your individual programs. There&#39;s also rotation resources.
So every rotation gets a folder under our resources module on the left menu, and you can put files and hyperlinks in there.
Metrics will email them out automatically to the resident before they they&#39;re scheduled to attend. And this is where you can make the rotation directors, um, administrators over these full so that they have the ability to edit the content step folder for block schedules and evaluations.
Uh, the first thing that we can say is for block schedules, th this is something that we use for our Iris reporting.
So it&#39;s important to make sure that&#39;s accurate. So block schedules are linked to Iris module and then block schedules have &lt;affirmative&gt; a, um, have assignments to put residents into certain blocks.
During the academic year, the attendings are often set up as rotation supervisors and that there as faculty members, they set up rotation supervisors.
You can also put them on the schedule. Um, that&#39;s, that&#39;s something that is possible, but typically they set up as rotation supervisors, metrics, evaluation module will look at the block schedule to find the resident, and then look at, look at the rotation record to find the rotation supervisors, and then match up that evaluation assignments and send email notifications.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/83237baa0c6f4c00b040e736ecc625a8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calculate Case Log Duration total in Stats Widget on Dashboard – Figma - 23 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So this is a bit of a tricky task. First thing I want to mention is it&#39;s going to be, this is going to be adding a widget on the student portal when a setting is turned on in the program portal.
So under a system set up setting, we&#39;ll be adding this setting and it was turned on. It&#39;ll show this widget.
That&#39;s the easiest part. The hard part is going to be making sense of all the different queries we have to do.
And if we cannot do this in an efficient manner, maybe we can simplify it. But let me first provide you with some context here for nursing students, A do something called practicum courses.
Hey, let&#39;s say These practicum courses we track them Created in Curriculum course Patient. The thing about these practicum courses is that They&#39;re not like regular curriculum courses that we typically manage.
They&#39;re going to be, um, completed at different hospitals as rotations. So Each practicum course, It says of many Rotations. So this is under system set up Patients Each course last, Uh, uh, let&#39;s say eight weeks.
I don&#39;t want it. Let&#39;s just say 10 weeks make this up. And During those toll weeks, Students are scheduled for patients using our users schedule table.
During those, each of those locations, They log cases. Each case log is linked to a location, And then we should also add Curriculum, Porch, rotation, and Rotation.
And, um, our patients are linked To The same rated course rotation. So it&#39;s a bit of trickery here. So, um, we have rotations which we have under system set up, which are linked to graded course rotations.
So if you go into metrics under rotations, It&#39;s connected to great, of course rotations here. Then we have Curriculum course rotations, which is under the curriculum module That is linked to a great course rotation here.
So let&#39;s go to, Um, Students are added to groups and those groups can be linked to a graded course rotation.
So you can see here, we can add groups to a greater course rotation, and that&#39;s how students are scheduled. A great course rotations rotations.
On the other hand are assigned using our user schedule module. So users are assigned to a user schedule, which is linked to a rotation case logs are logged, and then they have a direct link to the users, as well as a direct link to the rotations.
What we need to do for this task is, Is add up, okay, let&#39;s find Some of the number Of some of the feedback and it&#39;s four cases or Log During a practicum course.
So remember practicum courses are set up as graded course rotations In metrics and those prac correct. Let me clarify that practical courses are set up as curriculum course rotations and metrics, which have start date and end date.
The rotations that are created metrics are linked to a graded course. Rotations curriculum course rotations are also linked to the graded course rotations.
So in order for us to find this, some, we have to look at all the case logs that were entered with case states within a certain time period off the rotations that fall into the start between the start date and end date of the curriculum course rotations.
So that&#39;s a little tricky. So we have user schedule. So let&#39;s say cardiology, Um, from July one to, Um, 28, Let&#39;s say this is, um, internal medicine August.
So we have two users schedules That are linked to two separate rotations that are linked to course rotations &lt;inaudible&gt;, uh,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/44ea196170fc41f2b5527bc1ebea3210</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Notes – Figma - 10 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys for this feature, um, we&#39;re going to be updating the caseload&#39;s functionality to include a drop-down for a graded course rotations.
So in the curriculum For school of medicine in the curriculum module system set up graded course rotations, you have the ability to create different rotations and courses.
Um, and what we&#39;re doing is creating a way to link a case log to one of these created courses in rotations.
So we&#39;ll start at the design here. So when you create a case template, um, so if I go into metrics and I go to cases, templates you case continue, and when a new case is being created, we want to be able to add a check box for graded courses in rotations.
So that&#39;s what this checkbox is here right here. And then if it&#39;s turned on, when a trainee&#39;s logging a case, which you can see here, we&#39;re going to show this select horse option a hundred date.
So it&#39;s going to appear in its own role under date. And this dropdown is going to show all of the graded courses and rotations that are available in the system.
So anything that is in the graded courses, rotation, put that URL in there also Then when a faculty is reviewing a case that&#39;s and, uh, right down here.
Yeah. So when a faculty is reviewing a case, we&#39;re going to have, I didn&#39;t ask you design this right under, um, um, in case details as the first item here, we can say course, and the course that was selected, and this page also has a bug here.
We want to fix this so that this video is smaller and does not break out of it. So if we embed a video into the description field of the template, um, then it&#39;s showing up here.
So if you go to case logs cases and templates and edit day template and embedded video, it should not be larger than the model.
And then, so that&#39;s when this review is being reviewed. And then we have, when a case log is being, uh, this globs pages being looked at from the admin portal or from the personal portal, um, it should have a dropdown that costs it&#39;s called select course.
And then we&#39;re going to rename the rotations field to site specific rotations. And this is going to be select a course.
And then on the personal portal, same thing, select course. And then if that&#39;s selected, the page is going to, if you select a course in select search, it will filter the results that contain the particular course.
We also want to add a clear button to the right of left to this right here, so that it&#39;s, it can clear the searches.
And then once you search, this is going to allow you to download it to a PDF and Excel. We want to update the PDF and Excel to have the course that was selected.
And the last piece is actually on the reports page. We&#39;re going to be able to download the case logs here, and this report should also have a column called of course,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/891f78d6c3de4180b7f1e86ceabdea55</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for this functionality, when we look at, um, school of medicine so that it has to be UME program, and I went to some set up rotations that I&#39;m editing a rotation and you&#39;ll see, there&#39;s a map to curriculum functionality that allows me to select a academic year and then select a curriculum here.
So in addition to the map to curriculum, we&#39;re going to add a section called map to great, a great book.
And this is going to show, um, same appearance, but with different texts here, and then just the drop down that shows the great book quotations.
So currently, if I go to curriculum set up graded course rotations , we can have rotations created here that are for the grade book, and we&#39;re going in this functionality.
We&#39;re going to show any entry that&#39;s added here, that&#39;s to type rotation, and that&#39;s, what&#39;s going to appear in this dropdown.
So there&#39;ll be able to select one or more. I shouldn&#39;t sorry, it&#39;s going to be one. We&#39;re not going to allow one grade book, a rotation to map to.
So we&#39;re adding this in addition to the existing functionality there, which is to map.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9950eb42b94743acb430fb7098de3c9d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calculate Case Log Duration total in Stats Widget on Dashboard – Figma - 23 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Okay. So this particular task has a bit of a complex, a query that we had to build here. Um, the first thing that I want to mention is this is a widget that is going to show up on the student portal.
It would only show up if we have this setting turned on in the program system, set up the settings here, the checked off, then it&#39;ll appear here.
The tricky part is going to be the different types of data that&#39;s showing up. So first you see this select course dropdown.
Well, we need to display here is our, the graded course rotations. This one here, a particular student, let&#39;s say John Smith will be scheduled to the court will be scheduled to a curriculum course.
So under curriculum course, they will be put on a group and link to a curriculum course that curriculum course is going to be linked to a graded course rotation.
And what we&#39;re going to do is show in this dropdown, the graded course rotations that are, that this student is linked to.
So a student is put into a group group is linked to a graded course rotation, sorry, the curriculum course rotation student group group link to curriculum course rotation and curriculum course rotation is linked to grading course rotation.
So what we need to do is do a query of this student and see which curriculum course rotations that he or she is put into and then see which graded course rotations that that is linked to and display those graded course rotations here.
When you select a course, here we can. Pre-fill the start and end date here. So we can, these, you can, the user should be able to select the date range without politically putting a greater, uh, the task selecting a graded course rotation lock.
If they select a graded course rotation, here we will. Pre-fill the start and end dates using the curriculum course start and end dates.
So anatomy here is linked to a specific grade of course rotation and that, uh, anatomy and the curriculum has a start and end date.
And we can use that to pre-fill the dates here. Then if I can click calculate, I&#39;ll be able to get a total number of cases, minutes and hours for the rotations that this student, um, The student, a Lot of cases for.
So.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c8e37ff51e394a3696a10a2aa41bce29</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Faculty</pre></td><td><pre>So for this, uh, second guide that we&#39;re creating, this is going to be for faculty members and faculty members are going to be responsible for different practicum courses.
And we can start off this guide similar to the way that we started the student guide, where we tell them the domain, CU metrics, lab.com and let them know how they can use a single sign on to sign in and all that.
And then we can start with a screenshot of this page and saying how they&#39;re going to be arriving on the homepage.
And from the homepage, they&#39;ll see a section for any case, uh, any recent case logs that came in, that they need to approve evaluations that need to be completed.
And, um, but this only gives them a short list of whatever the top five, um, items are to see the full list of case logs.
You go to cases and logs. And in the case logs page, we have two tabs pending and completed on the pending tab.
I can see all the case logs that have been submitted by students that are in my practicum course, um, that needs to be approved.
So I can click review, see my student&#39;s name at the top, their role, and then review which site this was completed at, and then read through their responses.
The bottom, I can write a comment and either approve it or reject it. So we definitely want to include at least a screenshot at the top where we show the students information and the case details and at the bottom where we show whether they can approve and reject and highlight that a approved case logs will be, um, how did the student&#39;s account?
And the student will see that it was approved with the comments rejected case logs. Uh, we&#39;ll go back to the student and with the status of rejected and they&#39;ll be able to edit and completed again, approved, uh, case LOBs cannot be edited after it&#39;s approved.
Then once the case log is approved, it moves over to the completed tab where I can see all the case logs that I have approved in the past or rejected in the past.
And I can open it up and see any historical data. Then for evaluations under evaluations page, we have two tabs, actually three tabs.
The for me tab will show all the evaluations that I have to complete on someone else. These are for me to complete.
And by default, it will, we can show a screenshot of this top section and show how by default is for incomplete, but I can click on it and show all.
And it&#39;ll show me all the ones that I have completed in the past in order to complete one, I click view and then, um, fill out the questions here and click submit at the bottom.
I can also save a draft and come back to a later, if I need to the about me tab shows all the questions, all the evaluations that were completed by others on me.
And by default, they won&#39;t show anything if you have already looked at all of them. But if I clicked all, if I had any that, um, I could see that, um, sorry.
So by default it&#39;ll show all the new ones that came in and as you have reviewed and, um, read through them, it will get marked as, uh, reviewed.
And, um, um, but you can always go back to this tab and click all and it&#39;ll show all the ones that were submitted in the past.
The next thing is the, my evaluation summary, which allows me to run a report on my evaluation data, where I can select a date range, choose load assignments, and then generate a PDF, said that summarizes all my evaluation data.
So that&#39;s the evaluations page. Then under the review evaluations page, the faculty will be able to, um, see different evaluations that were submitted for students in the, my practicum course.
So if I have 25 students that are in my practicum course, I come to the evaluations page, use these filters at the top to select different students, different sites and see the evaluations that were submitted, um, on the students that were part of my course.
And another way another important section to highlight is the directory page. When I go to the directory page, I can open that up and I can see a list of all the students that have, that are enrolled in my practicum course.
And, uh, I can go into view profile and here it&#39;ll show me the profile information, the education time, all the clinical experiences they have completed.
Uh, we can kind of keep that screenshot at the top here. And then, uh, all the evaluations that were completed, uh, on the student, under the evaluations tab, I can open that up so we can mainly highlight the education section here, evaluations.
I can being able to view evaluations and then the case logs and showing all the case logs that were submitted, but on the student, by the student.
So that&#39;s the faculty account.

And &lt;affirmative&gt;, if this is selected, we&#39;re gonna show a drop down here where it will show the list of document categories.
So if I go into system setup, customize, we have document types &lt;affirmative&gt; and list of document types. So this is the, um, document types we&#39;re gonna show here.
And the purpose of this task is for us to be able to insert an image that&#39;s added to the document type.
So if I open up a profile and go to documents and certifications, you can see that different files can be added here.
And what we&#39;re trying to do is add an image here and then have that inserted into a document using this merge field.
Um, once the merch field is created, the administrator will be able to go to documents, templates, go to the Manish content and insert that merch field into this page.
So let&#39;s say it&#39;s this. So they&#39;re gonna be able to insert it like a typical mail, um, merge field. And when the document is generated, we&#39;re going to pull that image from the trainees document section and insert it here.
Um, it will only insert if it&#39;s a JPEG or PNG file and we&#39;ll use the full width and height of that document when we insert it.

So we can start off with a similar explanation of how they can log into their system, using the CU dot metrics, lab.com.
You are all and similar to the students section there, once they&#39;re in the system, on the homepage, they have evaluations, they have to complete for other individuals that know they have to evaluate the students in that program.
And then if I go to my calendar here, um, let&#39;s skip the calendar under case logs. If I go to logs, I&#39;m able to, I&#39;ll see two tabs, one for pending, and one for completed.
As students submit. If I submit case logs to me, they will go to the preceptor. And to me, the preceptor will not be able to make any changes to it or approve it.
Um, but they&#39;ll be able to see what the students submitted as a faculty. I&#39;ll be able to review them and approve them or reject them.
So when I review a case log at the top, it&#39;ll show me the trainee&#39;s name at the top. There, the site they performed the, uh, uh, saw the patient, the date, and then comments and other fields that were completed, um, all the way to the bottom there.
And then at the bottom, um, there&#39;ll be an approve and reject button. Let me go ahead and Submit a case as a student so that we could see the full process.

If I review this, I&#39;m not seeing the preceptor information at the top and same thing on the completed. Well, actually on the completed, it looks like it&#39;s showing.

So take those screenshots. I mean, uh, URLs Now let&#39;s log in as a student Basis View. And again, when I&#39;m looking at a student is not showing a preceptor at the top.
When I look at the, On the case logs page, you&#39;re exporting it. Doesn&#39;t show it at the top. It&#39;s also look as an admin.

So under clinical schedules shift schedules, when you open up a shift schedule, we have this section at the top for the leaderboard.
What we&#39;re going to do is remove this section. We can remove the frontend and the backend for this. Um, we actually, we don&#39;t want to remove this top section should only be up to the leaderboard and Then we&#39;re going to be, um, moving these buttons to the top here, like this design, and then adding a display shifts tallies button.
When you click on this, Actually, I&#39;m sorry. Um, Well remote this, um, Instead we&#39;ll be adding the tab. So when we click on this tab, it&#39;ll take, take us to this page.
And this page is going to resemble our requirements PA uh, the requirements dashboard. So if we take a look at the requirements dashboard, we can probably copy some of the code and here we&#39;re going to be able to select roles by default.
Um, it&#39;s going to show, it&#39;s going to have all the roles selected For The people that are on this shift template.
When you&#39;re creating a shift, let&#39;s go to metric for a second. Okay. I go to Schedules, shift him, shift schedules.
And if you click at it, you&#39;ll see that he can select roles. Let&#39;s say PGY 1, 2, 3. And if you open this up, these are the roles that we have shown here.
And When we are looking at this, a shift tallies only roles that are part of that schedule will be available for selection.
So if we were looking at that example and metrics, it would show PGY 1, 2, 3, and that&#39;s it. Um, and by default, all of these roles will be selected and you&#39;ll be seeing PGY 1, 2, 3 S listed out.
And then On the right side, you&#39;re going to be able to select different shift types. So in metrics you have shift templates here, see, these are the different types of shifts, and you&#39;ll be able to select that And see a tally Of how many shifts were assigned during this selected date range.
So by default, we can select all the roles and we can have the current academic year selected. And then, Uh, as you select one shift template at a time, it will show the tallies here.
Um, if there are more than one academic period, that&#39;s, um, Overlapping for this current one, because right now we allow multiple academic periods.
You can select the, You can select the first academic period, um, from the list So to explain that again, currently, um, you would select the current academic period.
However, if you have more than one overlapping academic period, there are some of our clients that have overlapping academic periods.
And that scenario, you will look at the current academic period. And if there&#39;s two academic periods that are overlapping, um, for today&#39;s date, you&#39;re going to select the first one and displayed here.
And then the reset will clear everything. When we&#39;re typing to search, we would want to, um, um, Filter this list as you&#39;re typing.
And we also need to be able to, um, sort, so if you want to click, if you want to be able to sort by the, um, each of the columns, so I can click on person and it&#39;ll sort by last name.
If I click on daily schedule, it&#39;ll sort by the, um, the, uh, number of shifts. Um, and then if I click on class, it&#39;ll sort by the number of shifts for class.
So that way they can find out which resident or student has the most number of shifts assigned.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f2eb4b232ca34f3cab644cc225f8a804</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Inbox (2,325) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 8 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. So I, that there is something that is different about nursing education than physician education is that a lot of times the nursing students are required to go find a rotation on their own and search through databases and like apply for it.
And then the school would approve that rotation site and the medical school community, the school, his response is building the relationship with the institutions and saying, Hey student, you&#39;re going to go here for your rotation.
So it, um, it&#39;s it&#39;s uh, so we don&#39;t really have, you know, agreements with different, uh, institutions to submit their rotations, but it is something that if the student does find a rotation, they can add that into the system and over time build up their own database of sites and rotations.
So we have nursing school like Chamberlain, uh, nursing school is using us for managing their training programs. And that&#39;s what they do.
They basically have the student fill out a form. Anytime there is a new site they want to go to, and then the school would approve it and it will be in the system and in the future, if they want to go somewhere, they can select that and assign it to the student.
So it&#39;s sort of, it is doable, um, in a slightly different way than having a capsule brand is doing. But I think the additional work for that process is not as much compared to what they&#39;re going to be saving from the rest of the system.
Yeah. Yep. I agree. So what, what do you think is the next step should be? Yup. Yeah, so the, I shall email you the dates.
Um, and then for that demo itself, it&#39;s going to be the, uh, scheduling, onboarding competencies and, um, anything else that they need to see.
Okay. And is there any, in terms of pricing also, is that something that is, is there, um, a budget or something that the nursing schools are, because I know that it&#39;s different than the medical schools.
Okay. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I think it really will streamline the process across the board because even nursing students, sometimes when they&#39;re working with physicians and if they need to collect any evaluations from the physician side, having everybody at the organization in one education management system is going to be, it&#39;s like epic.
You know, if everybody&#39;s on the same medical record system, it&#39;s the same thing on the education side. If they&#39;re all on the same education management system, it&#39;s makes everybody&#39;s life easier.
Um, so I&#39;ll prepare a demo and then we&#39;ll also use show a case study on how we implemented a Chamberlain university, cause that&#39;s one of the largest nursing schools out there.
Um, and then the, for the, um, current current students that are for the medical students, do you want, what do you want to do with that?
Um, the ones that you&#39;re managing, you want us to put together a proposal for that? Okay. So the one thing that, uh, it was a collab I emailing you about after the last meeting was if the students are there for the full year and they&#39;re using logging in and out of the system for all the rotations, then it&#39;s the full license.
But if they&#39;re only there for two or three months for some, um, some, some other students are only there for two or three months, then we would prorate that FTE to account for that.
So it is not the full rate. Uh, it all depends on how many, how long they&#39;re using it for, but it like they&#39;re going to be there for the core for the entire year.
Right. And then we don&#39;t, and we don&#39;t build for them after they graduate. Do you still have their data? And we only bill for the, um, for the current students.
Okay. Yeah, I was going to, so if the, um, if there, if it is required for everybody, what we could do is under requirements module on the left side, um, we could create a requirement that is assigned to all users was like that preceptor role.
And then it will be something that you can track and upload. So if you go to templates on requirements and then let&#39;s call create a new requirement and then call it that, um, agreement name, And then on the right side document category, just select anyone for now.
I&#39;ll, we&#39;ll make, we would need to create one called pre separate checklist. And then if you scroll down for share with, um, let&#39;s just call it supervising position or whichever one.
Yep. And then it scroll down. So this is something you&#39;re going to be there. How do they, how do you want them to submit this?
Is, are they going to be getting the signature and sending you to you? Or are you, um, getting a paper copy?
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So if you scroll down, now you&#39;re gonna turn on the check box called district garment is for program administrators to complete the second checkbox and, uh, let&#39;s see.
And then uncheck that first one there and click safe. Uh let&#39;s let&#39;s see. Yeah. I would just put a deadline for doesn&#39;t matter.
Yep. Assign now. And now if you go to the, now we have this administrative use only task that&#39;s created and it&#39;s going to be assigned to anybody with that role of supervising nurse midwife.
And let&#39;s go to the left side requirements and choose assignments and scroll down. Yeah. You can check. You can just select that there also at the top, just choose preceptor checklist and filter requirements on the right side.
I know you&#39;re right there. Yep. So this one is incomplete for this person. Now, if you click view details, when that PDF is available, you can submit that requirement.
And what happens is when you submit this, it will mark it as complete. And it also moved that document into the documents page on their profile.
So basically this is, this page allow you to track who has it completed, who hasn&#39;t completed it. And then ultimately the document all ends up in the one place on their profile.
If you ever need to go look it up, you can always open up that user&#39;s account. Yeah. Yep. So the, um, when you&#39;re creating that mission to make sure that it&#39;s set up as an administrative only so that it doesn&#39;t get actually assigned to the user, otherwise the user will get a notification saying, please upload this document.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/44d343f165eb45f9a362fc0b4a91f1c4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Display interactive Case Log Duration total in Stats Widget on Dashboard – Figma - 17 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So Micah, couple of feedback here, this, this is a great workflow. And, uh, um, it makes sure that we don&#39;t, uh, Have a speed issue.
Um, one thing is when you&#39;re calculating this, let&#39;s put this in the middle, in like a box or something with a label, uh, total Case duration.
And it can show the total hours as well as in minutes and the total case number of cases that were used to calculate this, having it right here, it makes it look like a button.
So instead of doing that, let&#39;s put a little box here that shows three stats and with the label of each of them, and that says a total hours and, and then parentheses hours, uh, total minutes and then total cases.
And then this one I really like, and it&#39;s showing the totals per rotation and Few things that, uh, factor in here.
One is sometimes there will be more than one preceptor. Um, it would also be good to show The courses, The, uh, graded courses that these rotations are linked to.
And my thoughts here are we grouped this together into, um, Something that can be expanded and collapsed, where if it&#39;s the, one of the greatest course rotations and has like five different rotations that are linked to it, it would show the total for that greater course rotation with the individual rotations like you have here, uh, with their subtotals And that&#39;s cause that&#39;s what you&#39;re selecting here.
If I Select a course and then Select a date range, It&#39;s going to show me, we want to show the late, uh, um, greater course rotation As the category.
So let me maybe easier if I do a quick mock up here. So it&#39;d be kind of like this Course code Total, I&#39;m making this up, Something like that.
And at the top, and then underneath that, you&#39;re listing out the, each of the different rotations that are linked to this graded course rotation that resulted in this total number of cases.
And we can also, Sorry. Uh, so you can not, we can also show way, uh, our slash minutes. That way it&#39;s easy for them to, uh, See both because when we are logging out, logging the case, we&#39;re inputting this in minutes, so it&#39;s good to show it in minutes and hours and it could be 20.25 HRS.
And then underneath that, um, X number of, uh, min minutes, and then we can also show the total number of cases.
So the heading is here. So we&#39;ll have a header at the top that shows you for the grade course, then each of the rotations are underneath it with the hours and minutes, and then another column for the total number of cases that led to that total.
So in the system, Remember that Each of these rotations Are mapped to a graded course rotations. So this, this graded course rotation is what we&#39;re displaying at the top here.
And then each of the rotations will be underneath that because they&#39;ll be multiple rotations linked to the same graded course rotations.
And then when you&#39;re selecting it here, you&#39;re selecting the, a graded course rotation and, uh, doing a date range while we would also want to do is make all of these are required field.
So if I select the course, I won&#39;t be able to select a date range outside of that, Everything I did like what you have here a lot.
Um, and I believe we can get to this, this a progress bar. Eventually the only piece that we need to add is on the, on the, um, graded course rotation, we&#39;ll need to input what are the total number of hours that are required And we can do that in a follow-up task in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a8b532db741c499dba428b1581afc201</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 8 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So in addition to that, when I sent you, these are some bugs that I came across while I was looking at the student portal here.
And first thing is, um, on the Chamberlain server, the diagnosis page takes a very long time to load. Um, so we can create a good lab issue specifically for this task and, and pointed to the CU server and say the diagnosis scene, uh, the queries need to be optimized so that, uh, we, these two tabs load faster.
So that&#39;s one thing. And then, Um, The other item was on the, um, so on the student portal, we show the schedules under clinical schedules, but we can&#39;t, we don&#39;t really allow them to access the schedules for the full, full, um, the full grid.
So it&#39;s just gives them an error message. So it&#39;s this best that on the student portal, we hide this clinical schedules tab and simply show the, my schedules here and list out the rotation, a name, and we can expand this information to show some more details so that you, for example, we can show the rotation, the site underneath it.
Um, the start date and end date is already here. And if I click view details, it&#39;s supposed to bring up a window.
It doesn&#39;t work. So we need to fix that also. So the F so just to recap, the first task is fixing the bugs with this speed on the bug.
Um, this is a bug diagnosis scene and procedure scene. Second task is to hide the clinical schedules page on only on the student portal and then showing the, my schedules time with the site D uh, underneath it, um, along with, um, if I click view details it, the, the window needs to pop up.
And, uh, it&#39;s a model that was working before. It can show details about the rotation such as the, the different fields that are part of a rotation record.
So if you go to metrics Rotations, and you can see, this is the name, the code, the site, um, this, it can show up on that model.
So students have more details about it, and you can also include name, code site, the description of it, as well as the, um, who the site precept, the rotation preceptors or faculty are.
So we can do a faculty slash staff section and list out all the faculty that are part of that. Plus you can also list out the rotation resources.
So if I go to rotation resources, you have, you may have a bunch of files that are in that folder.
If we can list out it out in the model with them to download it. So essentially what we&#39;re doing is, uh, removing this tab and making this tab a little bit more robust.
You can show the rotation details, uh, with the site underneath it. When you click on it, it brings up more a window modal window, which more details of other rotation, including the, um, who the rotation faculty staff is and the rotation resources.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c6cd8344c5334951a71f5841e3f2a9c4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 9 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>In this guide, we&#39;re going to be covering instructions for faculty members that are, that are responsible for practicum courses. And we&#39;re going to start off the guide with a similar setup as the student guide, where we go over the login page and explain that faculty should be logging into the system, using the Chamberlain university button that will take them to a page for single sign-on.
And, um, I&#39;m going to log in as a faculty here. So once a faculty logs into the system, they&#39;re going to see the homepage and we can put a screenshot of this and explain that, um, the case log section will show lists of the case logs that they were, uh, their students submitted the evaluations.
They have to complete and, and, um, uh, which if they want to see all of them, they can go to the case logs page and write on the pending tab.
They&#39;ll see the list of case logs. They have to review and approve. So in this case, this is a case log for a student.
The students submitted when they work, that they ed fast track at Robert Wood Johnson. We&#39;re going to open that up And then, uh, submit the case log here.
And you can see what all this, all the options that the student submitted. Uh, one thing that we can point out and the guy with this screenshot here is, um, they can see the students in the student information at the top with the name, the role, and then the date, this case is submitted, which site the student was working at when they submitted the case.
And then the other fields that are submitted is available at the bottom. They&#39;re able to put a comment in and approve or reject it.
We can put a screenshot of this also with, um, uh, explanation that for approving the student will receive an email that the case was approved and it will be added to their account for rejection.
They&#39;ll also receive an email saying that it was rejected and they can edit and resubmit the case if they want to.
All right, so let&#39;s, uh, close out of this. And then once a case has been approved or rejected, it will move over to the completed tab where I can see all the cases that have submitted in the past.
Now, if I go to the evaluations page here, we&#39;re going to have, um, all the evaluations that I have to complete under the, for me section and the ones that were submitted about me under the, about me tab.
So by default, it&#39;ll only show the incomplete option. We can point a arrow to scrape a screenshot of the stops.
I shouldn&#39;t point to the arrow and say, they can toggle between the, they could look into a screenshot of this and say, uh, if they need to see completed, once they can go to completed and it&#39;ll show all the ones that were submitted, and it also will show you, um, when the, if it was submitted, um, when it was submitted and so on, and you can go ahead and, uh, review anything that was in there.
So that&#39;s where evaluations that I have to complete on others. And for evaluations that were done by others on me, that would be under the about me tab.
And it&#39;s good to go there and periodically review review the ones that were submitted on me and make sure that they&#39;re keeping up to date on that.
If they need to create an open evaluation, they can click on open evaluation. And here, when you open up the evaluation, you can say, this is a template that&#39;s available for the faculty, which is faculty evaluation of the preceptor.
Start new and think of select a preceptor, the rotation that they&#39;re covering and complete that evaluation for the preceptor. So for evaluations, essentially, there are few things to, uh, sections to cover.
One is, um, evaluations that are for me to complete on others. Uh, we can take this screenshot here and then, um, also highlight that this filter allows them to toggle between the incomplete and the complete.
There&#39;s also the about me tab, where I can see the ones that were evaluated, um, submitted by others, evaluating me and my performance.
And it shows all or anything that you have in viewed, and then open evaluations to this third thing, which is to initiate an evaluation.
That is a, just a template. You can select a person and complete it any time you want. Last thing is the reports.
So I can use this to load reports, um, on evaluations that were submitted on me. So I can select the date range here and then run a report to see what was submitted on me.
So case logs evaluations, and then the other component of students is that as a faculty, I can review evaluations that were done, um, by others, on my students.
So if I go to the review evaluations page, I can see a list of all the evaluations that were submitted on my students and, or submitted by my students and view those evaluations here.
So this, so this is a good, um, screenshots to also include in say, um, the review evaluations page shows evaluations that are submitted on students or by students that are part of these faculties practicum courses.
And then same thing here. Under evaluation reports, I can run reports on my students and see, um, see data on the, uh, on the evaluations that were submitted on my students that are in my practicum course.
So cases, evaluation, evaluation, data, and then reviewing evaluate review, and the performance of my students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/577c200a6fe045ec83d0c6ba56976ca5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calculate Case Log Duration total in Stats Widget on Dashboard – Figma - 23 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this new update to metrics is going to add something to the dashboard For us students. And it&#39;s going to this dashboard.
Widget is going to be controlled by a setting under system, set up settings lab. This setting that is called cases, display case duration, total calculator on the dashboard.
And we can have, if this is turned on, We&#39;ll show this little widget on the student&#39;s dashboard. And the key thing here is we have a select course, the date range button fields here, and the course that we&#39;re selecting here is supposed to be Graded course rotation.
So under grade book set up, we have graded course rotations. So these graded course rotations are connected to The rotations that we use for scheduling.
And if I click edit on one of these, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a link from a regular rotation to a graded course, wait, book rotation.
So when we look at that student dashboard, what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re, we&#39;re allowing them to select a graded course rotation from the grade book, which may be linked to multiple regular rotations.
And we are Displaying aggregates based on the greater course rotation. So let&#39;s take a look at this here. So assuming that we selected, let&#39;s say anatomy 1 0 1 here, and we chose a date range.
When we click calculate, we&#39;re going to look at all the cases that were linked to different rotations That are connected to that anatomy 1 0 1 graded course rotation.
So let&#39;s do this. So we have case logs, Case logs are going to be connected to rotations And rotations are going to be connected to Graded Or A log as a case, have K state.
And, uh, we will draw a line here So, and then we have users, Users are logging the cases and users that put on user schedules, Which is also connected to rotations.
So I believe we have a direct link from the case logs or rotations. Now, if not, we may need to use a connection from the user schedule.
But the idea here is that if I&#39;m selecting a course, which this lists out all the graded course rotations, that All the way to course rotations that are, um, Connected to any of the rotations that the trainee Should.
It gets a little trickier than that. Um, So A course let&#39;s say anatomy is linked to a graded course rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e485b93282fc42d797dfdaf74e1fec23</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 7 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for the purpose of this task, what we need to do is on institutional portal, under programs, a search for Internal medicine here, the code review On this page.
We need to update this to Have a sector, a field that has the total number of slots that are licensed for that program.
And this field already exists in the back in the, uh, database. What we need to do is enable that on here, so that we see number of number of slots as a field typer into your into, and once that&#39;s added We&#39;re going to have the slots appear on the programs page.
So the total number of slots that are brief program with the number of active residents with that program as the primary program.
So this showing 14 residents in the slots that&#39;s allocated, and then there&#39;s 20 residents that is currently active with primary program equals to addiction medicine fellowship.
And if we have a number that is greater than the number of allocated slots, or less than the number of allocated slots, it will be a rep.
Otherwise it will just show us black so that they can, they can quickly identify any discrepancy in the number of, um, actual residents versus number of allocated slots.
And we&#39;ll be on. Also want to do is at the top, right? Do something similar to what we do on the evaluations page, where We can do download, uh, as an Excel.
So same data that&#39;s on the dashboard. As you hear it, download to Excel, similar to the active requirements page. And when they click on that, it&#39;ll download the program information as well as the slot act, um, available slots, active residents, active trainees, And the director information program status, all that into an Excel file.
So when he draws up, provide a sample Excel follow, that looks like And let&#39;s go back to the programs For a second.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d08cba018d724ee98f9d4c4c96415814</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Display interactive Case Log Duration total in Stats Widget on Dashboard – Figma - 17 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, Mike.

When you create a new program, there&#39;s a dropdown that allows us to determine what type of program it is. And there&#39;s G uh, residency medical school and nursing, I believe in there.
And we can turn this on automatically for the, when it&#39;s a nursing program And any student with the primary program as nursing, then that would make sure that we don&#39;t ha we don&#39;t accidentally forget to turn this on for some of the programs for medical school and residency programs.

So we want to cover the basics of metrics. The first thing that we want to emphasize in the article and the guide is the URL.
In order to access metrics, it&#39;s C U dot metrics, lab.com. When they arrive on this page, we can include a screenshot that points at this button.
That&#39;s what the, um, the single sign on that they should use to get into metrics. They should not use the, we want to point out that they should not use the login option down here.
They should use the single sign on option. And once they have logged into metrics, there&#39;ll be taken to the homepage where you can S uh, right now it&#39;s going to be empty, but in the evaluation section will show different evaluations.
They have to complete the, my profile section. We can let them know they can update their photo here, and then also use this space to store any personal, um, academic documents.
They want to store and have it in one place. Um, the photo and the documents are the two things that we can highlight here.
And then coming down to the calendar page, this is going to be a place where they will see all the rotations they&#39;re scheduled to there&#39;s the month view.
And the week view, main thing to highlight here is that it can clip the sync with my calendar button and sync this URL with Google, apple, or Microsoft next is cases.
So case page is going to allow them to log clinical cases as they see different patients. So to do a lot of a case, they would click on the new case button.
And here we can have screenshots that show the different sections, select a date, and it&#39;ll show the rotation that they&#39;re scheduled to for that particular date here.
They want to select their faculty for their practicum course. We use a word practicum in there assessing the fact that practicum course faculty, and then they&#39;re going to select the preceptors that they worked with, um, for this particular patient.
And then the diagnosis field they can search in here and find the appropriate ICD code for their diagnosis. Um, instead of scrolling down, it&#39;s best to type in and start searching and that&#39;ll give a more results.
And then the same thing for procedures, they can type to search and find the appropriate procedure that they did. And down here, these are, we don&#39;t need to go into specific details of every field here.
Uh, we can simply say you can fill out the other sections, um, based on the instructions that are provided. So for this three sections of the top, we can have specific instructions.
And then for the rest, we can tell them to fill it out as, as a wish. These are custom fields that are created by each of the programs.
And once the cases at log, um, point include a screenshot of this and say that, um, cases will be reviewed and approved by the faculty and periodically, and you&#39;ll see the, uh, pending approved or rejected status based on the, uh, stat based on what faculty have decided.
If a case log is rejected, he can resubmit that You can edit and re resubmit that The search, the search field here allows them to search for all the items that are, they have logged.
The export tab allows the individual students to export their cases. If I click search here, it&#39;ll bring up all the ones that I have in the system, and then click the download as PDF or Excel option to export for metrics.
The diagnosis seen column, or the tab will show me all the different diagnosis that I have logged. Um, this may take, you can, we can say that depending on how many cases have been logged, this may take a little while to load, And it gives them account of the different cases that they have logged procedures seen, Same thing.
So that&#39;s everything about case logs. Then we have the evaluations, uh, page and the, for me tab will show all the evaluations the students have to complete.
And as a, um, they can come into this page and complete the evaluations. And the about me tab will show all the evaluations that have been submitted and we can click on view and it showed the evaluations that have been submitted by other individuals about me.
So the first tab is for what I need to complete the second tab for while those had completed on me.
And then the evaluation summary page will me a report. All of the cases that have been logged. And then the schedules page also shows the, my schedule is that shows me all the rotations that have been scheduled to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/93ed28cefec24044811b999fa76b4408</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Intro</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, Alison hope you&#39;re doing well had a few minutes a day. So I wanted to create this video that gives you a big picture of what metrics is and what we&#39;re trying to do over the next year.
So metrics is a complete, uh, re learning management platform for healthcare. And, uh, we do everything from curriculum to demographics, student management, um, evaluations, case logging, clerkship, scheduling pre-clinical scheduling.
So it can be implemented in different ways. And current focus of, uh, Michigan state is to start with the clerkship component of metrics and the curriculum component.
Those are the two projects that we&#39;re currently doing, and this is a tentative timeline that we have for the implementation.
The clerkship project is, uh, still going on because we ended up expanding the scope of that. We also are working with Jessica for migrating all of the curriculum into the, all of the curriculum for pre-clinical and Conklin to metrics.
And then we&#39;re also supposed to start a project for enrollment and compliance. We started some of that work already where we can track whether or not the students have met graduation requirements and ideally move away from the FileMaker system that the school is using.
And we&#39;re creating a dashboard that that can be used by the team to know when the other rotations have been scheduled for pre for clinical students.
And eventually this Fe data will also feed into our document generation tool for generating MSPE letters. The grade book is I believe Kirsten said it&#39;s going to be handled on campus solutions.
Um, the, uh, we can, we&#39;re collecting the clerkship evaluation. So any sort of data that needs to go from clerkship into campus solutions, we can, we can, uh, set up an integration for that.
And eventually for pre-clinic complete clerkship, uh, scheduling, um, for basic sciences that can also be done in metrics. And later in the year, we&#39;re also going to be releasing some LMS capability if the school wants to take advantage of that.
So the way the system works is this is what the administration side looks like. And when the, uh, administrators log in, we have a variety of different modules on the left side, and each of those modules, uh, covered different functionality.
And then every individual user has their own personal portal, where they are able to log in and see the data and submit data that they need to, uh, um, they&#39;re responsible for as part of their training.
So starting with the users, if I go in here, we have a 312, we have 312 students in here as soon as an administrators.
So if I go ahead and open, one of these accounts, we&#39;ll see the student&#39;s profile, demographic information, education, history, attendance, exam scores, evaluations, work hours, case logs, documents, and certifications.
So this documents that certifications can be used for collecting different onboarding documents, such as immunization records and others HCLs BLS, those kinds of paperwork.
And we send out reminders to the administrators, um, when something is expired and if something needs to be renewed, currently we are in the process of, um, setting up the schedules.
So the let&#39;s go to sites first. So all of the MSU sites have been added to the system. And these sites are linked to different rotations that are offered at each site.
So every rotation that is that the student can participate in at each of the base hospitals and other electives are added here.
And once those are in here, the school is able to create schedules. And so you can see here view Mon Trenton is one of the schedules that we have imported, and these are the upcoming academic year schedule.
And when did this is published, the students can see that in their account and they can sync that with their personal device.
And no, um, no one, uh, the rotations are starting and ending. In addition to that, there&#39;s content that can be linked to this, or the students can have goals and objectives and other content pushed to them via email.
Then for evaluations, we create different evaluation templates and these templates are linked to those rotations and metrics would use the schedule to automatically assign these evaluations to the students or faculty, and then send them reminders.
So they&#39;re completed and reports can be run. So there&#39;s attending evaluation. Our clerkship students do an evaluation of a clerkship and so on in here, and this is only for the clerkship, but we also support evaluations for pre-clinical courses, basic sciences courses, different lectures and labs that they have.
So we haven&#39;t gotten to that side of the implementation yet. We&#39;re currently focused on the, uh, clerkship implementation. And once those evaluations that are assigned, you&#39;ll see all of that being tracked here.
You can see one of the forms that were submitted by the test student. These have responses and comments at the bottom.
So that&#39;s this part of it is almost done. The evaluations on the, um, scheduling. Next part we&#39;re working on is case logging case.
Logging allows the students to log all the patients that they saw, uh, and make sure that they&#39;re seeing certain diagnosis as part of their training.
So if they go to a cardiology rotation, making sure they are kind of CHF patients that they&#39;re seeing, they go to internal medicine, Making sure they&#39;re seeing enough diabetes and other kinds of internal medicine pathologies.
And we haven&#39;t created this yet. Once it&#39;s defined, the school can create a set of diagnosis, set of procedures that students have to do.
And as those cases are being logged, metrics will track whether or not those requirements are met and then that can be used to calculate their grade.

In addition to that, we&#39;re also migrating the curriculum.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/abe9bf8274994d10b849b6112e759441</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 8 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for this first guide, we&#39;re going to be creating a document that students can review when they start at the university and they&#39;re getting oriented to metrics.
So, first thing that we want to emphasize there is their login page C U dot metrics, lab.com. And once they arrived there, we can, um, we want to have a screenshot that it points to the Chamberlain university button.
So students who use the single sign on option to log in, they click on it, they would enter their Insta institutional login, and then there&#39;ll be routed back to metrics, to access metrics.
We want to explicitly say that they should not use the regular login option. It should be using the Chamberlain single sign on option.
So now I&#39;m going to log into metrics as a student, um, so that we can go through the student functionality.
So as a student at Chamberlain university, sorry, I logged in as a faculty, As a student at, uh, Chamberlain university.
When they first arrive, they&#39;re going to be arriving on this page. We can let them know that the left menus, where they&#39;re going to be navigating to, to find the necessary information, um, in the middle, they&#39;ll see evaluations, if that needs to be completed.
And the, my profile button allows them to, um, add, um, any personal documents they want to track and metrics, click on that, and they can put in, uh, any files that they want to track for their academic, um, progress, any, uh, any, any.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3ed33203771b4faab4d937c337590353</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So when you call her, start off by saying, um, you know, introducing yourself and saying, Hey, this is David from a metrics calling.
Uh, I don&#39;t know if you remember our conversation from a few months ago and hopefully she does. And, uh, then going to, you know, it&#39;s been a long time since the last time we spoke and, uh, you know, uh, my J sometime it&#39;s been when it&#39;s been this long and a lot of stuff has happened in the world.
One of the openings that I like to do is, you know, it seems like a lifetime ago since we last spoke and that ends up being a nice icebreaker.
And, uh, I feel like lot&#39;s been happening and ask her how she&#39;s doing. How&#39;s the program doing? And has there been any, um, uh, challenges, uh, in the last, uh, um, you know, few months as they went through onboarding with all the COVID spikes and see if, um, you know, ask her if she still is she&#39;s working from home and if, if they have any, um, or if everybody&#39;s back in the office, and then once you have some discussions about how she&#39;s doing, how the program is doing, then you can transition into, Hey, I also wanted to ask if you had a chance to, um, uh, if they, they, the residency management system has been brought up by the team and see if there&#39;s any, any, uh, discussion about exploring any new platforms.
And then if there is an interest in there, you can say, you know, this will be, we&#39;d love to have a, a, um, reschedule that demo that we couldn&#39;t do last time.
And then we can go into it. If they haven&#39;t had a chance to discuss it, then you can say, Hey, um, we are, we have done a lot of work in the last year.
We&#39;ve been, um, working with, uh, several large institutions to expand a lot of the platform. I&#39;d love to meet with you.
It doesn&#39;t have to be something that we bring everybody into at this point, I can meet with you and show you some of the things we&#39;ve been working on.
So at least you have an idea of what we&#39;re, what we can do. And if it&#39;s, if it comes up in any of the discussions internally, you can, um, you can, uh, uh, you know, uh, present us as an option.
So, so, so basically if she says they have been talking about it, asking for the demo, um, with multiple people, if they haven&#39;t talked about it, we can try to ask her to meet with just with her, just to give her awareness of our platform and what we do so that she can keep that in mind for the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/57844042c2a1494485764efc88a0dd70</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LucentRad – Figma - 4 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey slogan on and re so I was looking at the emails and if we&#39;re going to try to simplify the full report, um, who would say, this may be a way we can do, I modeled it after raised design here.
Um, w if we have a bunch of reports loaded, um, you can click next report, previous report, and then it will pull up the text here, the header text there, then each of the different, um, body part.
So this should be coming from a structured report that they&#39;re filling out. So you can see here, we would give them a template to use, and the templates will have different body, uh, sections here, and they will be filling out the appropriate section for pathology.
And then on the right side, we would provide the simplified version with different, if we have, we have the guidelines and there&#39;s multiple sentences being created for each finding, um, each would show up in a separate row, and then you can click a little arrow or click, click, click on it, to click a drop down and maybe get another version of it.
So, for example, if I&#39;m talking about the spleen and I put speaker the, it says, speak to your doctor at your next visit, I can click on it to select one of the other options, or then have one of the options be Right, my own simplification.
So you can either choose the first two or the L that&#39;s one, and then it gives him a text field to type it in.
Um, and maybe it would also be maybe in the, we can also incorporate feedback here, like the easy to follow moderate suggestion.
So this is a quick mock-up, um, it&#39;s, uh, it can be improved to make it look nicer and, um, add more things here.
But since we&#39;re, our goal is eventually to be matching up to existing phrases. Um, having the phrases appear in a separate line and given event dropdown to switch options, um, would make it easy and then they can write their own if they need to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a137ce58e622444b971af8aedde86891</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 31 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>And this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to handle core scheduling and metrics. So courses are managed by pre-medical or preclinical teams and in medical schools.
And the first part of setting a PE core schedule begins with creation of user groups as cool can create a set of groups for different courses or have one set of groups that are used across multiple courses, either way, a group&#39;s creation starts with coming to the groups page on the users groups tab on the users page, and these groups, can we create an, a spreadsheet and import it into metrics, or they can be created one by one in metrics once they are created, they can be populated with students using different, uh, different, uh, randomization rules.
So for example, if I want to populate, um, couple of groups here, I can go ahead and select those groups, select students of certain role, and then say, I want to populate these grew with these two groups with X number of students in each group, and then metrics will automatically allocate, um, students into each of these groups based on the number of students.
I want each group. So this can be done based on, um, number of students or number of a percentage of students, um, in each group.
So if we have a hundred students and you have four groups, you can say put 25% of the students in each of the groups, or they can say put, uh, if you have a hundred groups, a hundred students and you want to create, you want, you have 10 groups, you can say, put 10 students in each of them.
And that&#39;ll give us a 10 groups with 10 students each. So once groups are created, you can also click the preview groups tabs, to which to see what students are put into each of those groups.
Another thing to note about groups is that groups can be linked to a specific academic period, or they can be permanent groups, groups that are linked to academic periods.
Um, can we, uh, it should be used for, um, courses where students are, it should be used for, um, groups that are going to be used for one course, and then, um, does not need to be persist from one academic period to the next.
But if you have set of groups that you&#39;re going to be using over and over across multiple academic periods, then you can use a permanent group.
This is mostly useful for putting a different faculty or preceptors into groups because they are always going to be part of the school, but students will be there enrolled for one semester at a time.
So once these groups are created and populated with students, next thing to do is under courses in rotation. We have all of the courses already created and each course is linked to a specific academic period.
And then what we can do is go ahead and link different groups that we have in the system. These are not great names.
So I probably should not use these in the screenshots. Um, but we can put these students into a particular course and you can see that I&#39;ve put this group into this, uh, in this course.
And now every student that is in this, every student that is in this group is going to be available for scheduling for this cardiovascular course.
And once I have the groups linked up, I can go to sessions, select a particular course. I can see a session here.
If I expand that and click add to schedule, I can go ahead and I&#39;ll see that I have that group available for me for scheduling.
And typically there may be multiple groups that are linked to a link to a course, and then each of those groups will be listed here and I can select the one that is going to be used for this particular session.
So let&#39;s say an anatomy course has labs happening every Monday of the week. You may have four or five different anatomy groups being created and then put those anatomy groups into different sessions.
So I&#39;ll have those five groups show up here. I can select one of them. That group of students will be scheduled to this session.
Then I can create another group for the next week. And those a different set of students can be there for the next session.
So the way that the groups are created in metrics can vary from school to school. Um, but every group that is part of a course will be available for scheduling.
And they&#39;re linked to sessions based on which students be covering in which students are going to be.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f5832ea100a84194aec20178923100d0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Adtalem Product Management Team Introduction - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 2 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Jess, how are you doing? Hope all is well in Dallas and getting ready for the storm. Um, Chris has been, uh, anticipating, uh, power going out.
So hopefully that&#39;s not true. I want her to take a few minutes to give you an update on these, uh, priorities that we&#39;re working through.
Um, figured out it record a video since it&#39;s faster than writing everything out. So for Ross, Matt, and Ross AUC, the key things that we&#39;re addressing here is the faculty, um, have a way to download different evaluations that were completed on them.
But since there&#39;s so many students, it&#39;s not efficient for them to look at each form and, uh, we&#39;re building a report, uh, it&#39;s, it&#39;s an existing report.
We&#39;re adding to their portal that allows them to look at aggregated data for the evaluations. So that&#39;s something that is going to address both AUC and Ross meds, uh, uh, concerns.
And, uh, that I believe is the last critical item that it was on their onboarding sheet. Um, we&#39;re expected to finish that in the next few days, so that should be out there for the MSPE.
I didn&#39;t get a chance to join the most recent meetings, but I&#39;ve been keeping up with Chris and it sounds like, uh, the priority is for us to have the first component out there so that you, if the schools can start building the templates, and Chris mentioned that the standardization is not happening.
So we are, um, kind of work on this, um, this, uh, this module as a priority on our end and get that out so that the schools can start building it in and then we can work through any issues.
So that&#39;s, that&#39;s uh, after the last meeting, Chris had, uh, uh, the asset team to, um, prioritize that since it&#39;s, uh, we&#39;re not waiting on any standardized templates.
There are also a few issues that Kevin mentioned in the last call, which I think a couple of them, um, were already resolved or like a dropdown had something that wasn&#39;t showing up correctly.
Um, but those are sort of like one days has to, that we have addressed, uh, and got out there for Ross vet.
The main thing is the schedule optimizer. And, um, the, for this case optimizer, we actually have hired, uh, two contractors that is going to be helping us build this.
And one of them is actually an engineer from Google and he, uh, we&#39;re going to be building this on the Google&#39;s infrastructure instead of IBM like evalu was using.
And then there&#39;s going to be a lot of benefits for this, for the school. Um, I believe in the car, on the past system, it was a spreadsheet that they&#39;re sending over to evalu and then the optimizer was running and a spreadsheet was coming back.
We&#39;re trying to do this in the system so that the school can submit this information and have a result come back to the, uh, the schedule automatically built, um, in metrics instead of having to exchange spreadsheets.
So we need couple more pieces of information, information to get started. Kevin is going to be coordinating with the school on this.
And, uh, um, once we have that, we&#39;re expecting to start development on this it&#39;s, uh, later this month, and it&#39;s going to take about a couple months for us to build this out and they should be amplified at the time.
I would say about three months to, um, build it, and then they should still leave a lot of time to iron out any issues and make sure everybody&#39;s trained.
Um, for CU we are pretty much done with the UAT, so they should be ready to go live. Um, there is still a couple of, or reporting related items that came up we&#39;re, we&#39;re addressing those, um, um, as a smaller tasks where we are adding a case log report that allows them to just pull certain things, a total hours for calculating the number of hours the trainees, uh, covered, which is unique to see you and not to a format vet and then evaluation reports they needed something&#39;s tweaked.
So these are, um, relatively smaller items compared to these other schedule, optimizer and MSP. But the team is aware that the priority is, um, the reports and anything related to current implementation for Ross med and AUC.
The schedule optimizer is something that is not a panel going to be handled by our current development team. Their contractors are adding, so that&#39;s not going to affect our timeline for anything else we had planned.
And the MSPE is also something that is a priority. So they see, um, we&#39;re probably going to be prioritizing the cus, uh, reports, um, before finishing the MSPE because since they were ready to go live, but the Ross , um, reports and smaller issues that are part of the, uh, project that is ending, that&#39;s going to be the number one priority for the next few days until we get those resolved.
Um, I think this captured most of the major projects. I think there may be another, a couple other ones that I may have missed, but, um, they are not on a time sensitive items.
Uh, if I, if anything else comes up, I&#39;ll follow up. So, so hopefully this was helpful. Uh, we&#39;ll try to, uh, keep you updated of anything else that pops up, or if anything changes.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7e5ce2f801ca485d8cfc2f613093a2ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Onboarding Ideas</pre></td><td><pre>So the goal is to make the system as automated as possible for onboarding. So first step there&#39;s actually two, two parts of that is that I want to do the first part is to preload as much of the setup information as we need for different types of implementation.
So the, um, in order to, for example, I&#39;m running a worksheet, This is my original one. Yeah. So when it comes to Demo But here are the, here are the things that I&#39;m thinking about.
So I&#39;m creating a new program. What I want to be able to do is instead of having to upload milestones and stuff like that, I just select from a program dropdown.
I want to create an internal medicine program, or I want to select, I want to create a nursing program. And then when I do that, it&#39;s going to automatically have all of the milestones because these milestones were important.
We can just have it preloaded as a migration that fills it in. We don&#39;t need to go look for a spreadsheet, a spreadsheet and all that.
Yeah. So for like the milestones 2.0 a specialty, um, ones is, that&#39;s not a global objective. Is that more of a, that&#39;s a program objective, like for I Milestones 2.0, it&#39;s actually stored in a completely different part of the database.
It&#39;s not even on the curriculum. We have some, we have milestones table in there, but you don&#39;t even have to worry about that part.
It&#39;s sort of, um, When I&#39;m just thinking of like a big, create a new program and it&#39;s like a GME program, would it be just specifically like the ACG and meeting milestones or would it be like if you&#39;re creating an internal medicine program, would it be internal medicine, milestones?
Do we know if you&#39;re getting family medicine? So, so what, what what&#39;s going to happen is if you&#39;re creating a new program, it&#39;s going to have a dropdown at the top that says, I want to create an internal medicine program.
If I select internal medicine program and click continue is going to load a model or page, um, below that sort of like where we do evaluations part one and part two part three, and evaluation set up for part one would be select the type of program you want to create.
Part two would be these settings that show up and some of these things would automatically be turned on because I chose internal medicine.
Yeah, it&#39;s going to be GME is going to be a PGY 1, 2, 3. We don&#39;t need to do it for all specialties, but let&#39;s do it for the top specialties.
And then medical students are going to be turned off faculty. We&#39;re going to have a bunch of roles turned on, uh, staff.
We have a bunch of roles turned on. That means that we also have a bunch of these low row roles already preloaded into the system.
Okay. So we need, we can look at, um, you know, just go fair. They&#39;re the ones that we&#39;ve set up so far and James and MSU and Kaiser, and see what other roles that they create a standardized list of clean roles that we want to always use categories, document categories, and that.
So basically we will have sections here for turning on all these, all those document categories will already be in there, but we&#39;re just going to turn chat boxes on.
It&#39;ll all be on by default and we&#39;ll just uncheck the ones that don&#39;t need exam scores. So I think that&#39;ll be really helpful for setting this up.
Just some of this is just kind of hidden in pages unless you know what you&#39;re doing. And then if we do this in a way that we build this page and at the bottom, we also have a section for settings.
So all of the, for example, there&#39;s, I&#39;m going to make, compile a list of all the crap all over the place that we can put into one page for a program set up.
So this is one part there&#39;s each program should have, um, review of all of these settings and have this turn on, who should be doing what, like the, this is another thing which of these need to be turned on and off for each program.
So, so we all, a lot of times we forget to turn these things on because we&#39;re not doing as part of the initial setup, you had to go to the system, set up and do this, and then it&#39;s not so easy to enter some issue.
Why can&#39;t we got to set it up? Exactly. So settings the stuff on that previous page, the work hour types, the document types, exact event types.
Um, and then the, um, so once, once we have it, all of it in one page, we can also, we can use that for initial setup, but in the future, we can have this as a annual thing that we present to the program directors.
What was the program admin that says it&#39;s time for your annual audit of your program. Can you go through this and make sure all of your settings are good?
So then you&#39;re putting it back in their face, a little confirming, all the things that you want is correct. So you&#39;re more likely to have everything correct because every year the program coordinators and directors are auditing these things.
So, um, anyway, so the reason I&#39;m saying this is because the first you don&#39;t have to do this immediately, as well as recording it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/69a3d5efecef4b429c89efc819c37229</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 27 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike. So for that report that we just did, um, um, for these case law pages, um, two things that we need to adjust there is when we export from this system, um, let me see if I can Um, let&#39;s see.
So, uh, we need to, um, tweak the headers a little bit also. Um, so when we update that task for breaking up the demographics into separate columns, uh, we need to also make sure that these, the headers here, instead of calling a procedure date, we can just a K state procedure time.
Instead of that, it would be, uh, um, case duration. Okay. Sorry, case time. And then there&#39;s the procedure duration in minutes case duration in minutes.
And there&#39;s also a feedback duration in minutes, so we can rename those. And let&#39;s also, we also need to do some stats at the bottom where it would be, um, I think you had it, uh, designed for the Eva, uh, the, uh, Xcel report.
We can probably apply here where there was like a blue header, and then we can have a tally at the bottom here that shows the, um, total number of, uh, cases.
And then for feedback duration and procedure duration, we can sort of get a feedback duration and case duration, total number of minutes.
So let&#39;s see. Maybe we can do as, um, Or maybe we can even put it on the top somewhere. Cool cases.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So essentially we want to rename this to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/420aabbcf8ae4786bb98223c3c965bcd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Re: Medtrics - 27 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So for that cast, we did, you just wrote up where you have the demographics being broken up into separate columns.
In addition to that, we also would need to do some more cleanup on this report based on today&#39;s call. Um, one thing we sh we can try to do is apply that design.
You have four reports, uh, so it makes it look nicer at the, you had like a blue header and all that.
So we did in the past for Excel reports and then, um, break up the person&#39;s name into first name, last name, so they can sort it if needed and put their role in another column.
So, first name, last name, role. And then for the, um, for the M um, date column here, we can call it K state instead of procedure, date, case time, and to proceed instead of procedure time, then for duration, let&#39;s call it case duration in minutes.
And then for feedback duration, I would call the feedback duration in minutes. Um, and then for the supervisor, we want to call that a, I think we have it somewhere supervisor, we can call that, um, faculty, and then we also need to add a column called preceptor, or that&#39;s a new field we added.
So supervise, uh, supervisor will be renamed to faculty and also show their role in parentheses and then have another column called preceptor with their name and role in, in parentheses name.
And then for the seasons are, and then supervisor comments going to be renamed to faculty comments. And once we make those column changes, um, we also want to have a section at the top showing some stats.
First is a total cases, then total duration, I mean, a case duration total. So that&#39;s going to be basically tallying up the, um, case duration column, which is right here and then dividing by 60 to get the, uh, in hours.
And we can show it to like the second decimal places. And then for the feedback duration in minutes, same thing, we&#39;ll show it in hours.
So this is going to make the report more usable for, um, the faculty.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/39bee2adda1f4896aa91219dc81a0355</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Inbox | Medtrics | Intercom - 27 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So whenever we have a blog that needs to be written up the process for deciding when to write it up is, uh, based on how critical it is.
If it&#39;s an issue that needs to be solved immediately because it&#39;s stopping the client from doing something urgent, then we have to write that good lab issue immediately.
And whoever&#39;s dealing with that support issue can write it up. And if it&#39;s something that is non critical, you can simply tag the reply as a bug.
And then this will go into product board and then it can go through the product or workflow. And you don&#39;t have to write it up.
If it&#39;s a bug that you&#39;re writing up, the there&#39;s a quick links button at the top, right of Intercom. If you don&#39;t have the quick links app set up, you can just go to the app store, turn it on.
And these links will appear. Some of these are outdated, but if you click on the new bug, it will start up a new bug, uh, and get lab, choose the bug template.
And then you can fill that out. The important things to include here is a video under the screenshot section. You can, um, put a loom video.
Um, if you can also include a screenshot, if you like, but the little video is important, so that developers know how to get to that bug.
In that video, you want to show exactly how to recreate the bug. This how to reproduce section is, uh, is good to write, but if you can capture that in a video that&#39;s sufficient, then in the spec section want to create a checklist and this checklist should include what needs to be fixed, um, and how to fix.
And what is the correct solution? Uh, you don&#39;t want to just simply describe what is wrong, because then the developers have to figure out what needs, what to do about it.
So if something is, if a button is in the wrong position, like let&#39;s say in the left side of the screen, instead of right, don&#39;t simply say, what is on the left side of the screen?
You want to say move button to the right side of the screen. Um, and then maybe even have a little screenshot or, um, a mock-up of it if necessary.
And then you can also include the Intercom URL from here so that when this is released, David can include this URL in the release notes so that you know, that it&#39;s, uh, it&#39;s, uh, out and you can test it and confirm with the client.
So once you fill this form out, actually, um, at the top, there&#39;s also an important section here, naming of these, uh, bugs.
You want to include the module name, so such as Cases, the module or the portal that affects in institutional admin or personal portal, then the actual page.
So if it&#39;s in the case, log cases, module logs, page, and the logs tab, and then write down what the issue is.

And then we have students being attached to that particular, um, particular core course. And what we want to do is if, so if a group of students have been added to a course, the course directors, we can add it permission here that says, allow course directors to view case logs, um, for students in their course.
And when that&#39;s turned on, the course, directors will see something like this, where they open up on their personal portal cases and then a review logs page, and that&#39;ll show similar to the admin portal it page, where they can select one of the trainees that are in their, in their course and see the logs data.

So adding an Excel file here, a button here. So if I click that it&#39;ll export whatever results I got and we can, we want to specify to the developers that they should use the same endpoint as the, what we&#39;re using for the log download.
So it will be an export that resembles exactly what we have on the log of download, but it&#39;s only for the results that we have, um, pulled up on that page.
So that&#39;s on the program admin portal, but in addition to that, um, in the personal portals, we have the ability for site administrators and medical students to be able to run, uh, uh, see that same page.
So if I log in as a, um, Bonnie here and I go to the cases page, we&#39;ll have, uh, a export page here and I can search and it gives me results here.
And, um, Bonnie hasn&#39;t logged anything. So it&#39;s log something here. Okay. Bonnie can do anything here. So you can see a coal has these reports and it, well, Actually it looks like we do have an export functionality already for the, the student and resident portals or shooting portals.
And what we can do is basically tell the developers to copy this functionality to the admin portal. Um, so if the admin is looking at it, we have a download button as PDF as Excel, and it&#39;ll show an export like this.
And like we did in the last task, um, it&#39;ll be broken up these demographics and broken up into separate columns, but that&#39;s already, we handled on the other tasks.
Um, so all we&#39;re doing in this particular one is pointing them to the, um, trainee portal and sewing how the, there is a download to PDF and Excel here.
And we want the same, uh, download to Excel added to the admin portal, um, so that they can export it from there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7acdab353c304d328f2eee48571796a8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this second task is for again, for the logs download report. And right now we can run this report from here.
But what we want to do is on the logs page. If I am, um, coming here and I do a search and I get a result, um, let&#39;s pick something maybe that has a results.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4a87f540e21b4f808f603cc19fef853f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So Mike, in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the first, um, task, which is going to be on the cases, log, download logs page, want to select criteria.
And then if I choose one or more residents or select individuals and select a date range, it&#39;ll generate a spreadsheet.
Let&#39;s do this, delete a school of medicine, select all to like this download CSV. And if I open this up, it will show a column at the end called demographics.
And what we want to do is instead of having one column called demographics, we want to have separate columns for each of the sub, uh, custom questions that are in, in cost in this section here.
So if we have multiple custom questions, each of those questions we&#39;ll have a separate column and then it&#39;ll have the responses.
And that&#39;s all. If I open this up here, you&#39;ll see right now we put all of that into a demographics column.
We&#39;re getting set up demographics. We&#39;ll have each custom question listed out along the top, and then the responses for those, um, under, under that.
So you can see an example here. This was, um, medications and there&#39;s someone chose sugar. So instead of showing it in here, it would have a column called medications.
And then in that cell for that user would say sugar. So that&#39;s the first task, basically breaking this up into separate columns based on the custom questions that are created for that program.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/162200cbc27845c48e01b1854b13cdb1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike. So for these three tasks, um, under reports, we have a few different, uh, case log reports here. The main thing that we want to work on is this, um, case log downloads a report.
And what we want to do is under the curriculum functionality. So under Cordic alum set up curriculum permissions here, um, we want to add another checkbox here that says, allow course directors to, um, I love course directors to view case log data.
Um, and then, then, um, explain that if that is turned on the case log data for students that are in groups linked to that course will be available, um, to that course director.
So for example, if we have family medicine here, the course director is Perry Cox. And I go in here and add the PT and mentorship group here.
And then that means that any students that are part of the PTA membership, their logs data will be viewable by Perry Cox in his personal portal.
So if this is set up and under curriculum permissions director, we have an option that says a law course directors to view, um, case data.
Then we will have a, um, we will have the reports page appear in the, um, personal portal. And that reports page will show the logs, um, download.
And also on the case logs logs page, they&#39;ll be able to see the case logs for all the students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ad81acdc98e54ce79a8528a186e77781</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Case Logs – Figma - 24 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So for this particular task, it&#39;s a few different UI updates. And this came out of, uh, two meetings we had with the client today.
And most of the updates that we changed, we did a very excited by and looking forward to, uh, getting the students on there.
But there are a few things that we need to address before they go live. And I try to put all of them in one issue since we want to avoid merge conflicts, given the short timeframe, but if appropriate, you can split them up.
So I&#39;m going to start with the student portal here. So currently we have, this is a screenshot from the current, the current, uh, client&#39;s database.
And if I go into metrics here, I&#39;m going to go into the staging server And use acute care here. And on this acute care, we can see under cases.
There&#39;s a lot of custom questions they created. And on the template, if I edit this, you&#39;ll see that they have added those custom questions to the form, and they gave it as custom question name with questions underneath that section name, then question underneath that there&#39;s also fields that they have enabled at the top.
So what we are doing now is, um, uh, making some tweaks so that the way that the fields appear on the student&#39;s side, it looks more natural.
When a student, when a new person is entering it. So it&#39;s more intuitive. So if we look at my design here, first thing is number one, we have multiple, um, we have columns here where there are four fields here, three fields here.
Some of these fields have long texts in there. So procedures and diagnosis names, they can be pretty long. So to make room for that, it will, let&#39;s switch to a two fields parole and use it at a grid that supports that instead of four.
And instead of three here, it&#39;ll be two, a uniform. Um, every row has two fields and that gives it more room on the screen to fit more texts when they&#39;re, uh, longer texts, uh, in those drop-downs.
Then we have this, uh, rotation field that we recently added. We&#39;re going to rename that to my scheduled rotation. So it&#39;s indicating what rotation that they&#39;re scheduled to, and also show this bootstrap alert here that says, please select a date to view schedule information here, um, so that they know that they have to select a date before they can see the information.
And as soon as they select the date, it&#39;ll the bootstrap alert would disappear. And it just showed the information that we show.
Now, then we&#39;re going to rename this supervisor field to faculty. So currently supervisor, I&#39;m going to rename that to faculty.
Then the primary and diagnosis fields. Currently, they appear at the top of the page, under patient info. Instead of that, let&#39;s give that a specific diagnosis section.
So we have managed diagnosis, primary diagnosis, secondary diagnosis. If these two fields are enabled, we&#39;ll show the diagnosis section with the primary diagnosis, secondary diagnosis.
If they&#39;re not enabled we&#39;ll, we won&#39;t show it this section at all, same thing with procedures. If the procedure section is enabled, then it will show the procedures performed section with those in here.
And then at the bottom, any of the custom sections that they created, we&#39;ll show them in a separate card like this.
So if I go down here, you have a custom section called patient information, and that would appear under patient information.
Same thing with visit details right here. And it&#39;s going to show up under separate card here and then additional details at the bottom for the notes.
One field that&#39;s also getting updated here is the feedback duration. Normally you would have shown up the bottom here, but instead we can show that in the case detail section going forward.
So if the feedback duration field is enabled, it will do two things. One is that it would appear in the case details section.
And it would also be a dropdown similar to case duration where we show increments of 10. So you can look at the way that this field is created right now, where it shows you a dropdown with, um, up to one 20 where it&#39;s increments of 10.
So those are the updates that we&#39;re doing to the student portal here. And then on the list view of the student portal, we currently call this column supervisor gonna rename that to faculty.
Then the next section is preceptor and faculty view. So if you pull down the staging server here, you can actually log in as acute faculty test or a good preceptor test, and you&#39;ll be able to review, um, the necessary information and see what the client is seeing if you want, if you&#39;d like to.
But the idea here is that we&#39;re going to update this model when they&#39;re reviewing a case to include, um, the section of the top bolt for the preceptor and faculty models.
We&#39;re going to call it review case at the top of your case with the template name and for both of these preceptor review and faculty view, we&#39;re going to show the student faculty and preceptor information at the top.
So we are currently at the top. If I&#39;m looking at it as a faculty, I don&#39;t see the preceptor information at the top.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ab225ec7900a4b14a456f013b78dee5b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 21 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So the idea here is, um, we can update this layout, the design, um, to match our newer reporting functionality. So for example, if we look at the events report that we recently updated, you can see the newer design.
And then, um, we have the ability to select people here and these people selection dropdowns should be updated to include all users that are part of that program, including anybody that&#39;s inactive, um, and it can include, uh, um, the, it can, it can including inactive users and then we can put a little sign next to it in italics that says inactive.
Um, and we can also, um, make it so that We are using, um, Let me see. It&#39;s not going to work.
So, um, essentially we can use, um, uh, this dropdown and we can show all users that are affiliated with that program, um, that are inactive or active or inactive.
And with next to their name, we can show in italics, whether if they&#39;re inactive, if they&#39;re active, it doesn&#39;t need to say anything.
Um, and this, this way we&#39;re showing, uh, both the, uh, trainees as well as any faculty members. Um, and that can select more than one user if they want to.
So key things are, um, all users indicate, um, whether they&#39;re act inactive and then allow for multi selection, if they want to do that.
And we&#39;re going to apply that to this report, the case log download import first. Um, and then once that&#39;s done, we can see if we want to do it for other reports.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/645a2ccee4b3400eb0b5f45cefa26891</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software - 21 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Area. So for that email that you received with the, um, quotes from accessibility, um, here&#39;s a draft of the email that you can send back.
And I rather have you get into this habit of, uh, or build up the skills to have these kinds of discussions.
So I&#39;m going to explain what I&#39;m thinking here. So she sent over, let&#39;s pull this up. Okay. So sh she sent over these numbers, but unless I&#39;m missing something, it doesn&#39;t really indicate whether these are annual rates or monthly rates, because that&#39;s a huge difference.
Um, so first thing I did here is thank her for the information she introduced someone in the email. So it&#39;s always good to say hi to them also.
So great to meet you via email. And then we had a few questions about the pricing, are these monthly or annual rates, and then she&#39;s asking us for page counts.
So the assumption here is that we have to first define which plot plan size we fit into and then number of domains to calculate the rate.
So if we there&#39;s, what I explained here is that, how do you want us to do that? Do we want to look at the total number of unique templates that we have in Django and then calculate a number of, uh, pages because that&#39;s who, if we try to do it based on a client, it&#39;s very difficult to do that because we may have, uh, lots of user created content that we can really factor in.
And that changes throughout the year, depending on how much they&#39;re using the system. So I explained that here, and I&#39;m hoping that they will come back to us and say, calculate the number of unique pages based on like the templates that we have.
And then we would come up with an S I think we would probably fall under, um, the standard. And we look at the unique pages and then it would be four 90.
Uh, and I think this is going to be probably annual rate. So four 90 per year for MSU is what I&#39;m thinking is the number&#39;s going to be, but let&#39;s send that over to them.

So the, um, this, this document, I, I really, uh, wanted to say that this is, this is not what I saw last night and in terms of just a screenshot of it and see the percentage, I didn&#39;t really, um, see that it, how it was getting calculated and the fact that we have this, and you said you&#39;re working on something else.
I did want to give you some feedback on how to incorporate more of the UAT into this. Um, the first thing is the user acceptance testing should not be focused on the development tasks.
That should not be the focus of it because that&#39;s sort of telling them that we don&#39;t have things that they user needs.
Instead we need to, um, we don&#39;t, we need to focus on the actual UAT checklist and start creating a standardized checklist that they&#39;re going through when they&#39;re, when they&#39;re approaching the end of the implementation.
So for example, like for, um, St James, we&#39;re doing the clinical implementation at the end of that, it should be a checklist that they can go through and confirm that everything is working.
The, that spreadsheet that Chamberlain is using is a good starting point. If we could take out all the elements from there that is not specific to Chamberlain, um, such as like login and log a case and confirm that all the fields are in there, and those could be different checklists that they&#39;re marking office completed.
So this document that you&#39;re creating, we can actually share with them and have them updated in real time on a Google doc, as they&#39;re testing it.
And then your spreadsheet can be updated in real time from what they&#39;ve walked off as complete. And at the bottom of that, we can also have a few items that are development related, and that will capture anything that is specific for development, but the actual UAT progress should be based on the checklist items that they&#39;re testing as functionality that users attesting, that the features are configured the way that it should be.
So that will then change this in a way that every, at the end of every meeting, they&#39;re seeing a percentage of the features that are configured and ready to use.
And then a small percentage of that would be anything that specific to them that we are agreed to do custom development for, but ultimately in a few months, a year, there should be almost no development because we have all the features that they need.
So I think if we can merge what you have with the UAT checklist that an institution is using or manually testing, that will be amazing.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8bd7305739ca40acad597428698e842e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Chamberlain Next Steps - 1/20 - Google Sheets - 21 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Emory. So the one or two go through this, uh, and, um, uh, this new template and give you some thoughts on how to incorporate some other ideas for future implementation.
The, I really liked this, uh, this structure here, the fact that it&#39;s pulling from another thing that automatically calculates, um, the, the main thing that we want to keep highlighted here is the full UAT.
So I was thinking that we can, um, take that UAT, that it would be useful for us to, um, create a standardized UAT document.
So if we&#39;re doing a clerkship implementation, there are certain things that we want them to test at the end of it.
And certain things that they need to confirm that everything&#39;s working, because we started developing some of these UAT tests internally.
And that&#39;s what we provided to Chamberlain that they started using. Um, it&#39;s also customized to their specific forms and stuff, but if we look at that spreadsheet and we built, um, the original data source for this to incorporate the UAT items that are supposed to be manually tested and have the development items also in there this way, this can just be UAT progress like that.
And it can capture both the manual testing stuff, as well as the development cause it&#39;s supposed to be user acceptance.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/465557def5b449418730bfa778f70037</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kaiser Permanente - Internal Medicine - Oakland - PGY 1 (6/24/21-6/23/22) - 20 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey. So for this, a bug that we have, um, with Iris supported by a client where if we run a report, let&#39;s say if I do this from 12, 9, 1, 2001 to 1231, 2021, and this 12 31, 20 21 is the end of the fiscal year.
And I look, I run the gaps in schedule report, and I ran it, ran it for internal medicine, Oakland. If we take a look at this user here, um, here, you can see, it&#39;s saying there&#39;s a gap from 1231 till 1230.
So it&#39;s showing it backwards. It&#39;s supposed to show it correctly from, uh, if it was true, it would have been, it should have been correctly, uh, shown as a 12 30, 12 31, but this is not correct.
Anyway. So if I look at the actual data, you can see that for Brianna, she&#39;s scheduled to allergy, um, from sorry, wards from December 17 through December 30th and then allergy from December 31st to January 6th.
So this is not true. And in addition to that, um, for some reason, all of these are showing up backwards.
Um, so I believe it has something to do with the, uh, uh, the end of the fiscal year, maybe happening at the same time that they&#39;re changing rotations.
So if we go to Tracy here, um, she has the same thing. She&#39;s ending the elective here on December 30th and they started the new one here.
So maybe it has something to do with the fact that the fiscal year is ending at the same time as the rotation ending.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dc665d6bc27c4940bf58ae5ab3d8a510</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, this is, Hey Mike, this is a task that&#39;s also pending.

So if you have Perry Cox added as, um, director for cardiovascular, if there&#39;s, you know, 200 students that are added into a group and put into the cardiovascular course, and the permission to view evaluations is turned on, which is that task that you did recently then under their personal portal, under evaluations, that reports, they would be able to run reports for that.
So essentially what we are adding there is a reports page with this first tab evaluation summary report, and then letting them let the developers know in that specs, that they would only be able to run reports on individuals that are part of that course, um, or rotation based on what group has been added to that quarter rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3cc2acfc4b1a460a944d34bd63557d8f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this is a pending task that we need to put up. Um, the way that we currently do evaluation reports is, um, you can do it on the admin portal and run reports for people that have admin access.
But we need to do is in the curriculum. We have courses in rotations and we&#39;re linking a bunch of students to these courses and rotations using groups.
So we put a bunch of students into it and say, they&#39;re going to be part of the, um, the family medicine depart.
Um, uh, they have a new county medicine rotation. They have to do internal medicine. And these course directors era that are in the system, we&#39;ll also need to run reports on these students.
So what we want to do is take the reports, evaluation summary report, and make it available on the personal portal.
And it will be under, um, evaluations and then reports. And under the evaluation reports, they will have the, uh, evaluation summary report for now, um, and evaluate evaluation summary report.
We&#39;ll, uh, we&#39;ll have permissions on it so that if I&#39;m running a report, um, and I select date range, select the form, I would have the options to do filtering and all that stuff that we currently do, but it would only be for the individuals that have permissions to view.
So if I&#39;m a course director, I have this view and I would only be able to run reports on the, either myself, the evaluations that were submitted on me, that I have permissions to view, um, or for users that are in my, uh, added as a group into the courses that I&#39;m course director for.
Uh, so Perry Cox is course director for, um, let&#39;s say for cardiovascular here, any group of students that are added here, um, he&#39;ll be able to run reports on.
So that&#39;s um, so what we want to do is the, um, added, add the design for on the personal portal.
Under evaluations reports as a sub sub menu on the reports phase, have the evaluation summary report, explain how the course directors will have permissions to view reports for evaluations, for any students that are LinkedIn groups or any users that are linked as groups.
Um, any students that are LinkedIn, who&#39;s not any users. And then, um, have also be able to run, um, um, reports on, sorry, not the reports that we need to also have a permission that we can turn on.

So the Irish database is something that pulls in information from all the different schedules in metrics and generates a separate table in the database for, um, building these reports for a reimbursement from the government.
So the each fiscal year, which is different than the academic year, they have to generate a report and send it to the federal government and get reimbursed for all the training that this happened during that year.
This all regenerated, all data will pull the schedules for every single resident and fellow at that organization that worked during this timeframe.
Um, if you do it by site, you would allow you to select a specific site and look at the schedules that are linked to that site.
So if there&#39;s a rotation that&#39;s linked to that site, it will put all the schedules and pull that. So this is a faster way to regenerate specific areas of the Iris, uh, but in a large organization like Kaiser, if they triggered the all button, it will pull everything again.
So we, from a UX perspective, we should get rid of this all option and replace this with a, uh, a multi-select where they can select a few of the, um, sites and same thing here, select a few of the programs and regenerate for that this way, having this all off, they want to do all, they can always click this button, but otherwise it&#39;s something that they&#39;re going to accidentally hit and then may have to wait a long time.
In this case, it may be a bug because it shouldn&#39;t take hours for that. Uh, but, um, sometime, um, in the next a week or two, we can add a task to change this interview tree select where they can select multiple.
And then from both of these, we can remove the all option because if they want to do all, they should do this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/da2fd61302334c438c28f7b86095eb90</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Student Portal</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the personal, uh, the portals for medical students and some of the core functionality that they have, they have access to.
So as a medical student at a university, when I log into the platform, I have different tasks that I have to complete.
And I am also being informed about different things, uh, regarding my education. So right on the dashboard here, we have different announcements that has been shared with me, uh, from my organization.
And also from here, I can see any evaluations that I have to complete, uh, statistics on anything that I have completed in the past, if there are any.
And then I can always go to my profile to review my basic information and see any documents that have been added by my school here.
I can also set up a signature if I need to set up a signature for signing my, um, evaluations or other paperwork.
If I have any academic documents that I have to load into the system, um, so that I can store it in one central place, then I can do so.
Um, on my personal document section, I can add any document I want and have it organized in one place. Then the other mate, a major functionality for students is being able to see a calendar that shows where I&#39;m supposed to be working.
So my calendar here is telling me different, uh, um, hospitals or different settings that I&#39;m supposed to be working at.
And right now this is showing me it continuous. So, um, assignment that I have at a specific hospital for OB GYN, but sometimes I may also see events that are happening where I can, I&#39;ll be covering a clinic for half a day, or if I have a lecture that I have to attend, those items appear here, I can toggle between the week view and the month view.
And then I can also sync with an external calendar here by clicking on here, copying and pasting this URL into my Google, apple or Microsoft calendar as part of some of my, um, clinical rotations, uh, courses that I complete, I need to log cases.
So these cases allow me to, um, keep track of all the, um, patients that I saw. So I can come in here, click a new case and then fill out a form that captures that patient&#39;s information and put that into my record as a type of patient that I&#39;ve seen.
Um, I can also export my data from metrics and then even see, um, statistics on how I have, um, met the requirements that I have.
So if I, if my school tells me that I have to meet certain number of these cases, um, metrics keeps track of whether or not they met those mate, uh, minimum requirements and market is complete.
Another important part of my workflow is evaluations, and I can see, um, evaluations that were completed by my faculty members on me.
So if I go to the system and open up a form, I can see what a faculty wrote about me and how I am performing in a specific, uh, training program.
So in this case, this preceptor evaluated me and when I was working on the pediatric rotation and this is how they graded me.
And then the, the evaluations page also allows me to complete evaluations on other individuals. So these are some of the forms that I submitted, um, on faculty or, uh, or courses that I was parked.
I was in, um, this toggle up here allows me to switch between what&#39;s incomplete and what&#39;s completed, and then make sure that they&#39;re all done on time.
If I need to, I can also download them to a PDF. And so those are the, the core functionality of the medical student, uh, portal.
There are other modules, but these are the main things that a student needs to be aware of when they start using that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/255d26c6837b46308d00d3b471b74b16</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 18 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this is an email that came in from, um, Kevin and they had some usability issues related to the evaluation summary report.
And we can make some tweaks here to improve this. So the first thing is, for course evaluations, if I go to, um, you have to go to a school of medicine here, I go to values in summary and click load assignments.
You have a course evaluation so I can choose that form. But when I come down here, if I choose course it will run the report for all courses.
Um, while we want to do is give them a way to select evaluate tours, just like we can set up an evaluator.
We want them to click on this and be able to select a, a course so they can run it for one or more courses instead of the, all the courses in the system, which becomes overwhelming.
The thing to note about courses is also each course is linked to an academic period. So we will need to give them a way to select an academic period and then select one or more courses within that.
So the best, the way that I can think of handling that is we borrow the design from evaluation templates. So if I go to core, see Val assignment rules and which courses you want to include.
So we give them an inter a similar to basically copy this interface so they can select all or, um, some and also switch the academic period.
So that&#39;s where the core. So when I click on this, it would up here under here. The other updates that they&#39;re looking for is when a PDF that we asked them to when they asked the system to send them PDFs, um, it will send them a PDF with all the same names like evaluation, summary report or something like that.
Some generic name, what we need to do is be more intelligent with those email PDF names and could be more descriptive, of course, selected the name of the course by the title, faculty Val&#39;s and name of the faculty.
Um, so essentially if they, if they, um, well, we want to do is if they sell, if they don&#39;t select any grouping, it would be based on, um, whatever the standard name we currently have.
But if they select a grouping and they choose to have it separated into separate PDFs for each group, we would use the different group to name them.
So if I choose to group, by course, then each of the file names would have the course name as part of that.
Um, same thing with like Jews by evaluator. Then it would show us, include the evaluators name as part of that.
And this is for the emails that I&#39;ve emailed you, the PDF that I sent to them via email, Let&#39;s see, We&#39;ll have it generated and sent to me and we&#39;ll see what the file name is.
So that&#39;s for the second thing. Third thing is multi-select. So for the evaluate Tor and evaluate T fields here, if we show a list of the users, but this list can be ridiculously long.
If you&#39;re dealing with a place like Ross, where they have thousands of users. So instead of having these types of fields, it is better.
If we use the evaluate turn evaluates, he feels like we have on the assignment rules page, where they can expand and collapse and it&#39;ll show actually the best one is from the manually assigned page.
So if I choose, Actually I take that back. So it&#39;s a, we could use it similar to these, but with the ability to multi-select.
So this would have a little box in it, and each of these would have a box in it, so I can select multiple trainees here or I can select all .
So that&#39;s for The evaluate and evaluate tour fields. Essentially, we replaced this with, um, one of those multi-select options. So it&#39;s going to be the same fields that the evaluations assignments page, but with the option to select more than one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/628b5843ebd64726aa093f3332044bb3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Issue · Medtrics Lab / Medtrics · GitLab - 18 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for this new functionality we&#39;re adding, it&#39;ll be added to the logs page and cases. And for the locks page under table, we&#39;re going to add a second tab for results that are shown, um, went into administrator or anybody that has access to the logs page, uh, looks up case logs.
So either an admin or a specific individual with the ability to view the logs page from the personal portal comes in here, they will search for submitted results.
And what we&#39;re going to do is add a second tab so that if I&#39;m looking at a results here, it allows me to see individual submissions.
But the second tab will allow me to see aggregate data on the custom questions that have been included on those logs.
So the client is creating a set of custom questions here, and when the students submit those results, we want to be able to see aggregate data on those custom questions.
This is what that looks like. Submitted logs will show everything as is statistics tab will show the custom questions. There are three different types of custom questions.
There are multiple choice checklists and text questions. And what we&#39;re doing is I&#39;m showing all of it in a format that is similar to our evaluation summary report.
And we don&#39;t have to worry about the PDF for now. It will be simply showing this in a printable format if they want to print it.
And it&#39;s going to show all the multiple choice questions, total responses, percentages. Again, these totals and percentages are based on what they pulled up.
So they&#39;re going to use the filters at the top to pull up a bunch of results. When they click on the statistics tab, they&#39;re showing the same aggregate data for the logs that were pulled up on the first tab.
Um, it&#39;s not for everything in the system it&#39;s specifically for what was pulled up on that tab. And, uh, we also need to make sure that this is something that will work with a large amount of data.
Um, so if it&#39;s something they will, um, that&#39;ll work with a lot of submissions, um, could we have several hundred to a few thousand logs that are being pulled up and that&#39;ll, it&#39;ll work on the statistics tab.
If it becomes a speed issue, then, uh, we may need to consider adding a way to, um, have this email to them once the, uh, um, like if, if there, if more than X number of logs are pulled up, then we made, when they go to switch to the statistics tab, we may need to have a way to have that report email to them.
Um, but for now the, we w we want to focus on the interface And making sure that we can get the data there.
Um, but this particular client is not going to have a lot of beta initially. So if we can do the email option as a follow-up task, if necessary.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/817c87cd9a8a47f384f6fde98e406d7f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Issue · Medtrics Lab / Medtrics · GitLab - 18 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>They will see a new report under the social results. So if I go in here and I apply a bunch of filters and I click search, I&#39;ll get results at the bottom and are right now, these results can only be viewed one at one at a time, or I can download it and see a table, but I can&#39;t see any reporting data, meaning like aggregate data.
So what we&#39;re going to add here is a second tab. So for any results I pull up, I can switch to the second tab and see aggregate data.
And this aggregate data is going to look like a very similar to the evaluation summary report, where we show the, uh, the field, the options, the total responses, along with the percentage.
So we have, this is what it looks like for a checklist, sorry, multiple choice checklist and text question. And the fields that we want to include are the standard fields.
Sorry, let&#39;s go to case logs templates. And if I edit one of these templates, we have standard fields that are, they can be turned on.
So we want to include these fields on there as a report for things like, um, um, actually let me be more specific here.
We want to do all of the fields here, except for, except for M date. We don&#39;t need to show the case.
Um, yeah.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/69aea4ed5c13471a9fd2e2af1879384f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 9 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike, so this functionality is for giving global PR uh, permissions to view the schedules to specific individuals. So currently we have block schedules and shift schedules as the two types of schedules that can be created for a department in the, uh, uh, for clinical schedules.
And for each of those, we could go in there and we can give specific individuals, permissions, um, curriculum, schedule, administrators, I can give a block schedule.
So I added, I added this particular schedule called effective date, and then I can select an individual and this individual will be able to view and edit this schedule.
I can do the same thing for shift schedules. I can edit one of these schedules and then set up admin users and they can view and edit the schedule.
But what we don&#39;t have is a global permission that says these individuals should be able to view or edit view or, um, and, or edit all block schedules and all shifts schedules that are part of a department.
And if someone is hired as a chief resident or, or a schedule administrator, they don&#39;t want to be going in there and specifying for every single schedule, who&#39;s going to be able to edit it because that can lead to a lot of manual errors.
So we want to have a global setting that, that applies for all schedules that are part of the department. So what we can do is put that, um, in school of medicine, you&#39;re going to see an extra menu item here, system set up permissions, and here, what we want to do is, um, be able to select an individual.
And then we&#39;re going to add another check box at the bottom that says, um, similar to this first one here says calendar administrator, we&#39;ll say block schedule administrator, and then another one called shift schedule administrator.
And if that&#39;s turned on this individual will be able to, um, we&#39;ll be, may, we&#39;ll be able to, um, should we, should we, we should do two things.
One actually, um, it&#39;ll be a block block schedule and block schedule administrator shift schedule administrator, and inside each of that, we can have a specific, uh, uh, checkbox for view permissions and then edit permissions.
If you click edit permissions view should automatically be given. So for both shift and for block Schedule, we&#39;ll have view and edit permissions.
And if that&#39;s turned on, they&#39;ll be able to view and or edit the schedules that are created in there in this department on their personal portal.
So this we&#39;re dealing with people that do not have admin privileges, and we&#39;re giving them the ability to manage schedules for our department.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b210f5d23d22456785bc0b5813ff7a81</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Schedules</pre></td><td><pre>So let&#39;s take a look at this, a spreadsheet I&#39;m sending over the spreadsheet, this video. And, uh, another document that I created that may, um, it was just my attempt to try to put some of these constraints together.
Um, so the first thing is we have, this is a schedule, uh, business rules for a veterinary school. And then we first gonna have this mandatory and elective classes.
So think of rotations as classes and each class, uh, and the mandatory students have to complete each of them. So each of the, each unique one.
So if they&#39;re bovine, they have to complete the requirements of bovine. And if you see here, the students have to complete once to complete this lab.
So within the, these are the weeks that are offered, it is offered. These are the days of the week that it&#39;s offered.
And this is the minimum number of students, maximum number of students, if you&#39;re less than a minimum number of students, they don&#39;t, they won&#39;t be this, this, uh, this session would not happen so of the week to Monday, they only have 10 students, it would not happen.
So it&#39;s happens when there&#39;s a minimum and they can support up to a maximum number of students, sometimes the courses or classes that are offered in different patterns.
Um, so in this case you have the communications class being offered Monday, Thursday, and, um, Thursday here. So it&#39;s, it&#39;s different.
Um, four weeks, one through seven and four weeks, nine through 12 versus week eight. But the key thing here is the students don&#39;t have to complete both communications courses.
They would just, each student has to complete one of them. They would just need to be placed into one of these sessions because the requirement is for them to attend at least one, sometimes some of these, there are different constraints.
So in this one, the students must attend an entire week to complete this class. So emergency is offered Monday through Friday and then offered weeks one through 13.
So if they&#39;re scheduled to the Monday, they would automatically schedule two Mondays to three Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Um, and that&#39;s for that one, for some of them, you had to attend both days of the same week.
So for equine, if it&#39;s offered two days, if a student is scheduled to the Monday, they also have to be scheduled to the Thursday.
Another constraint is sometimes the students need to be scheduled in pairs or threes. So students will be asked to create a group.
And if they&#39;re in a same group with somebody else, that those two students will have to be scheduled together throughout the, um, required coursework.
So if they have to do it two times a week and every other week, um, those students in those groups will always be scheduled together like John and Sally will be in the same group, um, throughout the entire set semester.
And, uh, that&#39;s how it needs to be structured. There&#39;s some more complex rules here, whether something needs to be done.
Um, like the physical class needs to be done in 2010 to 21 days before the surgery one. So that&#39;s, so there are constraints where if you&#39;ve been scheduled to something, the next assignment can only happen after certain number of days, um, or a certain number of sessions.
So I think that&#39;s something that we need to discuss a little bit more detail, so we can skip that for now, as for the electives, each student will submit a preference list to the school, and then the school will put that into the optimizer and we have to make match up Stu um, two electives per student and try to maximize their preferences.
And each of these intro courses cannot be scheduled with any of the, Okay. Yeah. So maximum of one intro to clinics rotation per week.
So if this, although these mandatory ones are in to clinic, these are not mandatory and they need to be able to match, uh, put them into, into, uh, a schedule so that you don&#39;t have more than one of these intro classes happening in the same week.
And then there&#39;s a few other constraint. Uh, each student must be need to reschedule once per week. The entire classes are gonna be scheduled here, divide them into some.
So this, this can be a combination of some manual assignments. And then, um, rest of pre-filling some of these courses, for example, if they need to be the entire class, we can pre-fill that in, before we send it to the optimizer, this one, you have to be scheduling in groups of three and they have to be together for those throughout the semester.
And the trio groups will have to have one week off during the three week rotation. So minimum of 14 days between one assignment to the next.
So if they&#39;re scheduled to a surgery, um, assignment, they&#39;re going to be assigned in groups of three and then they would have a week off and then they would have the next surgery assignment.
Um, Well, get you more details on the surgery, one, uh, separately. Um, you can read through it to see if it makes sense.
We have a follow-up discussion with the client to get some more clarification on these. Um, but I think they should give you a big picture idea of how those constraints have to be created.
And then based on one of, some of the things that Sam sent over, I created a, this document kind of, um, putting some of these things into a document that outlines what we maybe we may need to create.
So this may or may not be helpful. I just found the province very interesting. So I was just trying to spend a couple hours just writing it out and maybe completely useless.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e28466e64bd04dbbb7bdfb35d55504d6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sample of Sem 7 for Optimization (September 2020).xlsx - Google Sheets - 7 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Sohn. So wanted to send over a few things. Uh, first thing is this document in this is going to be in a folder with a couple of files, and it is a document that was sent over to our us from our client.
And I&#39;ll quickly explain how it is structured. So we have some mandatory rotations which will, we can just call it courses.
And then for each of these courses, they are offered certain days and times. So in this bovine course, you have happening weeks two through seven, seven through 12, and each of those weeks it&#39;s offered on a Monday.
And you can see that it has start time and end time. Then for the next one, it&#39;s offered these days also on a Monday.
Then if you look at, let&#39;s say equine, this is offered Monday on Thursday, along these days, uh, these a weeks.
And it also shows the start time and end time. Um, and there, some of these courses have two separate patterns.
So for example, for equine, the first pattern is it&#39;s offered a Monday and Thursday. And then the second pattern is, is offered Monday and Wednesday.
Another one is offered Tuesday and Thursday. And on the right side of the note section, it tells us how they should be scheduled.
So for the first row, it&#39;s saying that student must attend once to complete this lab. So this is a mandatory rotation, but the student has to complete one Monday out of all of the possible Mondays to have completed this course.
Then we have, um, must students must attend an entire week to complete this Monday through Monday. So in this particular example, number six, they would, the courses, um, classes offered all 13 weeks and they have to complete, um, a Monday through, um, Monday to have that complete.
If they&#39;re assigned to a Monday, then they have to be assigned Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Um, and then the next student will come on the following Monday.
So that&#39;s how this particular one is assigned. And then for the next one, student must attend both days of the same week to complete this.
So in this case, if a student is scheduled to week two, they would have to assign complete the Monday and Thursday to have completed this course.
They don&#39;t have to do it every week. They just have to do any one of the Monday, um, Thursday, um, schedule.
And then since these three are the same course, um, another student may complete the course by doing the Monday, Wednesday, a different student may complete it by doing the Tuesday, Thursday.
So this, um, To this also, so they don&#39;t have to take all three. They only have to TA as students only have to be scheduled to one of these three, uh, in order to complete it.
And another constraint here is that, um, in some scenarios, students will need to be attending in pairs. So they had to be in groups of two to three and all those students have to be scheduled together throughout the entire.
Um, let&#39;s see each Farrow students need to be forming a group and scheduled a total of four times in the same group of pairs two times for physicals and tube times for surgery.
And they need to be done 10 to 21 days. Um, physical needs to determine days before except for week one, which would be only be, so that&#39;s a weird scenario.
Um, we can get into that one later, a little bit more in a discussion. Um, but the idea here is sometimes the students need to be done in pairs and they have to always be together in those pairs.
They also have to have sometimes have a gap before the next assignment. So if I&#39;m scheduled to something, then I will need to be scheduled to a, in order before I can be scheduled to the same rotation or same course again, I would have to have a gap.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/398d075ca6774481a92c29130b97b49d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Issue · Medtrics Lab / Medtrics · GitLab - 18 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for this task, we have a new report that&#39;s being added to the case logs page.

If someone has access to the logs page with this, um, section, I should be able to search for any of these filters and bring up results.
And for the results that I bring up, I&#39;m going to have a second tab where I can see a report.
So the first tab will show the, uh, the results of submitted logs. And the second will show, um, statistics. And basically for any custom question that has been submitted on the logs that I pulled up, it&#39;ll show stats.
This would be a custom, multiple choice question, custom checklist question, and a custom tax question. And we&#39;re using the same design as the evaluation summary report.
Remember that custom questions are created under case law custom questions, and it can be added to the templates. And that&#39;s the data that we&#39;re using to generate this report.
And we&#39;ll be able to, um, export this to a PDF also, which will follow the same design as the evaluation summary report.
The one other thing that I wanted to mention is, um, we also, in addition to the custom questions, we also want to include the data from these fields.

So we have a meeting on the calendar ready for tomorrow. So I was hoping we can move the OKR planning to that, but I wanted to send a video, explaining a few things and seeing if you can think about it.
Um, and the main, uh, one of the main things that I want to have on the OKR for you this quarter is, um, you and I working more closely together on the business side of things, because it&#39;s not really going to be scalable for you, especially from a financial is being one of the most important roles in the company for us to not have more direct, uh, um, communication more frequently.
And also I want to go over on a, like a scheduled basis, different, uh, sales and communication strategies that, um, with clients, so that this is something that you&#39;re really getting a deep understanding of.
Um, otherwise it&#39;s going to be really difficult to have a, a chief financial officer role, you know, it&#39;s, it is helpful what you&#39;ve been doing so far with the finance.
Uh, it&#39;s in, uh, if you, if that is your interest and getting more into the business side of things, um, it is right now, it&#39;s been mainly been bookkeeping and filling out forms and completing things, which is definitely very helpful.
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not, um, it&#39;s, but we need to sort of focus some of the energy into mastering the business and having a more intuitive understanding of these negotiations we&#39;re having.
And then, so that you&#39;re able to make decisions and help strategize and not simply be providing different spreadsheets and transactions.
Um, and I want you to be able to make those decisions when it needs to be made. And it, it is, um, I think the only way to do that is to spend enough time working together, um, uh, over extended period of time.
And like I&#39;ve been doing with, uh, Chris and David Ward more recently, so that, and you&#39;re able to also, um, you know, step away from the development side and then lead the finance side as a, uh, from the strategy perspective and not just the, uh, the bookkeeping perspective.
So first thing I want to do tomorrow is sorta talk, come up with a plan to do that, and I will commit whatever time necessary to do, make that happen, um, and having some sort of consistent schedule.
And if you, if you&#39;re not interested in, you want to stay focused on the development side, uh, that&#39;s fine. Also, I just, for me personally, I just need to know which direction you want to go into.
Um, but the finance side, it definitely needs, uh, more, um, communication and collaboration than we&#39;ve been having in the Past.
Um, otherwise it&#39;s it, it&#39;s very difficult to do that. And from a development perspective, it&#39;s okay. You know, if you&#39;re working directly with Chris and figuring out tasks, that&#39;s fine.
Um, if that&#39;s the direction you want to go to, um, either way, I&#39;m fine with doing whatever works best for you.

Um, I know that I saw that we already have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow so we can meet at that time.
Uh I&#39;ll do, I did want to send you this video to go over a few things. Um, so you can think about, uh, I think about them before the meeting.
So the first part is, um, I&#39;m trying to, one of the things I want to talk about is what, you know, just to get a general idea of what, um, your plans and interests are, because we haven&#39;t been talking on a consistent basis.
And partly because I haven&#39;t maybe been able to join these, uh, um, meetings that we have scheduled every two weeks.
Um, so I&#39;m, I&#39;m, I&#39;ve been out of the loop on a few things, so, and, uh, I want to figure out, um, which direction that you&#39;re wanting to go into.
So for example, if you are interested in looking for something else and figuring out a different strategy for yourself, then that&#39;s fine.
And I want to help plan for that. Um, but if, if your long-term plan is to at least in the short term long, you know, next week continue to stay on, uh, is to continue with metrics and getting more into the finance role.
Um, and the, for me, the more important thing is to spend part of next quarter, working with you to con uh, to have more discussions and an ongoing basis, like multiple times a week, so that you&#39;re actually able to help, you know, uh, from a finance perspective, make decisions and strategy because it&#39;s chief financial officer role, you know, it has to, it&#39;s something that requires more than just the bookkeeping aspect of it that, uh, it&#39;s definitely helpful that you&#39;ve been maintaining the books and filling out the forms, uh, but it&#39;s more of the strategy and being able to, um, make decisions and communicate on behalf of the company and, uh, you know, build relationships on behalf of the company assets, you financial officer.
So if that is, you know, that&#39;s, the more in a bookkeeping can be outsourced to anybody, that&#39;s going to fill out the spreadsheet and reconcile the books, but the people relationship building aspect of it, and the strategy part of the business, that&#39;s the part of the chief financial officer that the company needs.
And for me to, for me to be able to scale the business so you can decide, uh, I want you to think about what is, what, what you want to do, and if it is to continue building on that, uh, finance aspect of it, uh, planning out the OKR KRS in a way that you and I are working more closely together to, you know, the way that I&#39;ve been working with, uh, um, Chris or, or David, a ward, so that there&#39;s more regular communication and calls.
Um, so you&#39;re mastering the business and learning to make those decisions for yourself, um, instead of, um, um, helping with different pieces, uh, after the decisions have been made.
So I want to help you do that. And the second thing I wanted to focus on as part of the OKR is helping you also, um, take on more of a leadership role within the team.
So for example, like, you know, you&#39;re doing a lot of work to help the team with different areas. And sometimes when that is delivered to the team, when they slack message, it&#39;s not really being heard by everybody and working and having a few meetings with you to figure out strategies, for example, how do we get the health, uh, dashboard more active and, uh, developing a process by which people can provide you with feedback for that.
And that is a, you know, having a more like a structured meetings for delivering your ideas to them, and then getting feedback for it.
Uh, the OKR, for example, having a way for you to get those regular updates to you and basically selling your ideas and needs to the team.
So you&#39;re getting what you need as a chief financial officer, to make sure that it&#39;s, you&#39;re able to do what you&#39;re you need to get done.
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s not something that I can write in a book or it&#39;s in a document. So I wanted to sort of plan out time this water to work through different projects and see how to talk through how to approach it similar to the way that David water and I are doing this externally for sales.
And then for the last side is development. So regardless, I mean, you, I want you to decide which, which, you know, what you want to do for your future.
Um, if you want to leave, that&#39;s, that&#39;s, uh, you know, I have to, I&#39;ll support you and then I help you with whatever you need to do to get that accomplished.
And if you, um, or if you want to stay and you want to do finance that&#39;s, I want to meet with you and meet we&#39;ll help you build up your experience on the business side.
And if you, and the third option is, if you don&#39;t want to do the finance article, if you want to stay on do purely development, that&#39;s also fine.
Um, but if you&#39;re going to be doing it, one of the things that is important is you&#39;re not going to be, if you don&#39;t want to be full doing full-time development, we definitely need to start looking for someone to take over, um, some of the backend development in the us time zone.
So.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eed228b91b384496a00ab786bae70795</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Meeting recaps - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 17 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>we&#39;ve had a few minutes, a one to review these questions and figured if you get to record a video than to write everything out, first thing is, um, um, for this question in toward to clinics and communications course or anything like that, um, you are correct.
And I, I don&#39;t think I may, maybe I didn&#39;t do a good job explaining that in that video it&#39;s there it&#39;s one course and they have to make the requirements for it just happens to have a different availability on the eighth week.
So, um, again, this is something that, um, it&#39;s also one, another thing that I want to mention is this is a September, 2020, uh, document that we&#39;re reviewing.
And these availabilities may change in 2022. So, but the general, um, format of it is gonna stay the same, where it should the different types of requirements.
They have attend one per week or once per Monday, or once per Thursday. So in this example, it would be intro to communications.
It&#39;s saying must attend once to complete this. So it&#39;s available, um, all of these weeks, Mondays and Thursdays, but on week eight, for some reason, the Monday one is not available.
That&#39;s why they put it into a separate role, but it&#39;s not two separate rotations. It&#39;s one rotation, same thing with this equine.
It&#39;s saying that it&#39;s available Mondays and Thursdays all of these days, but for week 12, maybe the professor is not available on Thursday.
So they&#39;re going to do it on Wednesday for week eight. Maybe the professor&#39;s not available on Monday, but they&#39;re available on Tuesday so they can have the session on Tuesday.
Um, but the students have to attend to both days of that week to complete the rotation. So they cannot attend a Monday and the following one day they have to attend a Monday and a Thursday, but Tuesday and Thursday or the Monday and the Wednesday.
Um, but these are not separate courses. These are one course. And if the student finished the requirements on week two, they&#39;re not expected to also meet the requirements will be 12 and week eight in the schedule.
The expected to be the same for every week. No, it&#39;s, it wouldn&#39;t be same for every week. Um, we would need to schedule out the full semester all at once, but it wouldn&#39;t be the same because students are expected to complete one assignment per week and so on.
So next week we meet different set of students. Um, we&#39;re not going to be scheduling. We&#39;ve got a time w we need to have this semester scheduled all at once.
And if they need to make any changes, they would make that change manually in our system. Uh, we would optimize it once at the beginning of the semester, send it over to them and they would have made any manual changes when students have to be done in pairs.
So it, it has to be the same students, um, four pairs pairs, and for three hours, the students will stay together for the entire semester.
And the idea here is that those students are going to be working on certain like projects. So in this case, these are mostly surgery labs.
They&#39;re going to be doing certain surgeries on a patient, on a animal because we&#39;re a veterinary school and they need to be together and work on the same animal.
It wouldn&#39;t be different. So pre-filling, so, um, for this optimizer to work, um, they may have some preferences for some of the students.
And in addition to that, and we can also ask them to do some of the scheduling manually. If some of these parameters are too difficult, um, we can ask them to do that manually.
And pre-fill it so that the optimizer already has some information to start with. So these are the, um, uh, let&#39;s see.
So for example, these two right here, divide the class into six evenly, half the group on, um, Tuesday and other half on Thursday.
So if we want them to do that manually, we can just pre-fill those. And not even, not even have to worry about this, the, the optimizer, um, and there may also be some students that need to meet certain requirements on certain days.
Um, they will put that in manually And it bought the student&#39;s preferences. Um, they&#39;re basically all the selecting, um, the electives, I believe they selected one or two electives.
They need as a preference, the rest of it we&#39;re going to automate. So that also makes it easier. Um, so it would outfit as a student, they would say, I want, I&#39;m interested in, um, two of these electives and then the, uh, optimizer would factor that in and try to schedule it.
And the rest of it all will all be automated. We can try to get more information on the performances in our next call.
We&#39;re trying to schedule a call with the school to get some more details. So what to do if there is no actual possible yet.
So this is something that we have would have to figure this out. Um, I do know that it is successful successfully being solved by IBM&#39;s see flex platform right now, which is similar to all our tools.
So it&#39;s the IBM&#39;s version of the optimizer. So they do that. The other company that, um, the school use is currently solving this for them using Aussie osteophytes.
Um, so we make it is solvable, but we have to figure out what they&#39;re using all of the constraints or some of them.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dd321472edbe4bf187e67a66cec68eb9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Review Questions</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Sohn. Hi Tom. Hope you guys are well had a few minutes. So I wanted to review your questions and see if I can make things a little bit clearer.
So starting with the first one here On the example of intro to clinics communications course. Um, so what you&#39;re describing here is correct, uh, in the initial video, maybe I did not explain this.
Um, clearly let&#39;s take a look at that again. So for these courses that have two rows, they&#39;re expected to, uh, complete the requirements for the course, not the requirements for each role.
So let&#39;s take a look at this first one. Students must complete once attended ones to complete this core as soon as much must attend at least once to complete this lab.
Um, so for this example here, it&#39;s available Mondays and Thursdays in weeks, one through oh seven and weeks, seven through 11, nine through 11 on the eighth week.
For some reason, the professor&#39;s not available on Monday. So it&#39;s only available on Thursday. Um, so if the student is being scheduled by the optimizer, they only have to meet the, uh, the Elliot to attend the lab once in any of these weeks to meet the requirements.
And so if they can, if they attend the Thursday on the eighth week, they don&#39;t have to attend all of these other weeks.
Same thing for equine here and SAC weeks, two through seven, nine through 11 and 13, it&#39;s available Monday, Thursday, but we 12, for some reason, the professor&#39;s not available on Thursday.
So they&#39;re going to hold it on Wednesday week eight. Professor&#39;s not available on Monday. So they&#39;re going to evaluate, they&#39;re going to have it on Tuesday for this set of courses.
Key thing is they have to attend both days during the same week. So if they attend the Monday a week, two, they have to attend Thursday of week two.
They cannot attend a Monday a week two, and then a Monday a week, week three, it has to be the same two days of the week for Let&#39;s see, second one and expect to be the same each week.
So we are expected to complete the schedule once per semester. So we have to build the entire semester schedule all at once at the start of the semester and each week, it will be slightly different depending on the students and the sessions they&#39;re attending, but we&#39;re not going to be scheduling it week at a time if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking, but they have to schedule all of it.
And then it&#39;s going to be different based on which slots are available, which students are attending because some of these courses only require one day of the entire semester to complete the requirement when students have to be done in pairs.
Yes, it has to be the same pairs per week. So we look at this document again, some of these are let&#39;s see pear.
So he had to F pair. Um, here, they have to be the same students every time because they&#39;re going to be working together on the projects and they need to be together.
And for this also in three hours, so three students at a time. So for this one here, number of students must be an even number.
That&#39;s not really a group. That&#39;s just, students need to be that, that is students as an even number, but for this requirement, and for this one requirement, they are creating groups and they&#39;re, um, the students are expected to form their own groups and then those groups are going to be what&#39;s scheduled.
So when we&#39;re doing the optimizer, we would get, uh, we would, we would be providing a list of those group IDs and those group IDs would, can contain a bunch of students.
And then that would be what&#39;s scheduled into the individual students. And well, I guess we need to also account for, um, each the assigning each, each of those students in those groups and making sure that, um, we&#39;re tallying up the requirements for the individual students within that night.
So we would schedule based on the groups, but we also need to keep track of the individual student&#39;s requirements as for mentions of pre-filling the schedule.
Um, so this is something that can help us make the problem easier. So some of these constraints we can ask the school to pre-fill manually to make the optimizer run faster, or make sure it solves the problem.
Um, because the last question that you have here, we do need to solve this because currently the school is using another platform to solve this using the IPM Plex optimizer.
So they have the other platform uses IBM, sleep plaques, and they do have a solution being generated. School is trying to replace that with our system.
And so we have to have a solution, but what we could tell them is, Hey, do some of this work manually so that our system finds a solution.
And it&#39;s something that we would, you would need to tell us that these are the ones that we need to remove.
And we can discuss that with the school. Um, I know there are still a few more pieces that are missing that we need to clarify.
Um, the, but we&#39;re trying to get a meeting with the school. As soon as I have that, I&#39;ll send it over, um, or we can meet.
And one other piece is the student&#39;s preferences. They are not expected to provide a full rank list like we had in the past.
This they&#39;re simply providing a list of, um, elect like cup to one or two electives that they are, they want to do.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b593b5eb251142f6a91cec6cc0cd9c30</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 13 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Maria. So to explain that issue here is how it works on the case pay case logs page in metrics logged in as a resident here, I can select a template and add a new case, and there&#39;s a supervisor field here.
And by default, initially it shows all the faculty members that are part of the program. Anybody that&#39;s, some of the faculties are type, but as a resident completes the requirements for a certain procedures, we mark them as credentialed.
And if they&#39;re credentialed, their name will also appear here. So they can act as a supervisor for other residents. She is saying that if she is, if a PGY two resident is logging a case, they don&#39;t want that PUI two to be supervised by another PGY two resident.
Who&#39;s their friend. Um, we don&#39;t really have a way to prevent that from happening. And, uh, um, it is something that we can consider adding in the future.
But in the meantime, it&#39;s something that they need to address as a policy and convert, communicate that to the resident.
They should, they shouldn&#39;t be selecting their peers. Um, it&#39;s the only way that you can hide someone is to, if they&#39;re not credentialed and we don&#39;t want to credential a resident, um, to prevent it from the dropdown because you&#39;re taking away, um, their academic completion, uh, to prevent it from a dropdown.
So what we need to do is, uh, um, let her know that this is something that we will, um, add to our list of some as a, at a setting in the future so that it will, um, it will be a setting that they can turn on that says if, um, if you&#39;re a PGY two resident logging in this dropdown will not show anybody with the same role and that will solve their problem, but we&#39;re not going to do that immediately.
It&#39;s not, it&#39;s a nice to have feature and they just need to communicate their policy with their resident residents. And in Intercom, when this comes up, after we communicate this, what we need to do is, um, tag it as a feature request.
So if I click on this, I can click client feature request and save it. So while we need to do is, um, put a note and the ability to, um, actually I want to add a, I think that will prevent same role from, So what&#39;s happening here is I&#39;m writing this note.
I&#39;m tagging it. Now, this message is automatically going to get sent into a product board so that Mike can flag this and put it into product board as a feature request for the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3cf6cff8cb2f4858bc9a1c78b9fa41da</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 13 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>David. So before we finalize the okay, ours for tomorrow, uh, wanted to get some, um, my thoughts to you about the ones that you have here in general.
Um, it will be great if you can turn some of these into some sort of measurable goals, um, measurable key results, as best as you can.
I know some of them are different, more difficult and, um, others to quantify into measurable number, um, but setting some sort of goal and then working towards that would be the best for key results.
Um, another thing that I wanted to try to talk through is, um, for these things that were discussed with novel, um, I would prefer to have you work with me on creating this hiring process, as well as, um, the job requirements that we need, uh, to make sure that we have a clear way of hiring someone.
And then, um, this one would give you, um, um, a way to get into that process more rather than just me working on it with someone else.
And then you just reviewing it after I&#39;d rather work directly with you and others can provide people feedback on it.
So adjusting some of these development things so that you have time for it. So for example, the client health dashboard, it&#39;s not really something that you should spend a lot of time this quarter, mainly because others have not really made use of what you already built.
And if anything, this quarter, we I&#39;d rather work with you to figure out some strategies to sell what you have done to them.
So they make use of it. I feel like there&#39;s a lot of value that can get out of it already, but they&#39;re not really seeing the benefits yet, and I can work with you on, um, some ways to present it.
So that similar to the way that I&#39;m selling the product to clients, you&#39;re sort of selling what you have built to the team.
And it&#39;s a good practice for conveying those ideas to the team. And I, once I see it, I feel like they&#39;ll start using it more anyway.
So rather than doing development, it more development would be better for us to cut back on the development side and I can help you with the, uh, how we can a strategy to get them, to use it more this quarter.
And then next quarter, maybe get back to building new things based on what we learned. And then for the third, um, areas I&#39;d like to also incorporate a key result on, um, being at the office.
Um, and, uh, this is something that we had in plan for you and real to be back, uh, sometime, um, after you guys had left.
And I want that to happen starting in February, uh, mainly because of three things. One is we&#39;re getting really, uh, into doing a lot of these onboarding and more larger clients coming onboard.
And it&#39;s not very efficient, uh, for us to do everything remotely. And for me, I&#39;m having multiple meetings with different people to communicate things that are happening.
And it&#39;s things that takes five minutes on a face-to-face interaction after a meeting ends up being a zoom call that needs to be scheduled and coordinated.
Um, and if we, you know, even if you can&#39;t do two days, uh, uh, starting February, maybe we can do one day.
I think it&#39;ll one, it will give others a chance to interact with you and for you to work with them.
And, uh, and then, then for you and I, to also have some, um, planning sessions in person, um, I also spoke to Rio about this and I told him that, you know, if he cannot find a place right now having some budget for him to stay at a hotel, um, when he&#39;s coming down.
So this is the first reason is being coming more efficient as we take on these bigger clients. And the second reason is, um, for getting that experience, working with the team in person, because it is especially important for, um, anyone like you or Rio that haven&#39;t worked in a larger company with, in an office setting to get that experience now.
And so that as we add more people, um, you&#39;re comfortable with the, uh, uh, with the team and, um, leading the team in a direct interaction because eventually it will be something that each person has to do.
And it&#39;s good for you to build that skill up now, little by little. And I think that&#39;s very important, um, as we try to add more people.
So, um, you know, I, it&#39;s not something that I, I want to say, like everybody needs to be there all the time.
I personally don&#39;t. I prefer to work from home too, but I try to go in there because newer team members are not as efficient when they don&#39;t have people to mentor them and coach them and communicate the one on the regular basis.
So put that into the key result as some sort of goal that you have. And even if, um, you can start with one day, that&#39;d be something.
And then as the winter gets better, we can increase that. Um, and then we can also try to plan it in a way that you have, um, and we&#39;re making use of that.
They are to, um, more efficiently so that it&#39;s not always going to be possible to plan everything out, to happen that day, but at the very least, uh, it&#39;s, uh, it can be coordinated better than we have done in the past.
So to summarize, um, first is turning it into measurable key results. Um, second is cutting back on some of these development things so that you have time to work me on The hiring process, the job requirements and so on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/60306db48bef4afab0557fad4429c1ca</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Editor - Guide 1: Templates | Stonly - 5 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So wanted to just record the video as I&#39;m previewing it for any changes. See, I feel that it would be good if we, um, Specify that course and session sort of belong together.
Um, this needs some tweaking, Leave it at a session scheduled to manually, cause they&#39;re probably not going to be assigned quarterly.
Um, and then the other piece is Maybe what we can do is group them. Um, It&#39;s not gonna work even as it is, and then They can figure it out thinking this is good.
I&#39;m overthinking it. So leave that. And then.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a94886ac24ce41b0a2cc866bd3212cef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 13 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So, um, some, uh, things I&#39;ve been thinking about for your OKR, um, you can finalize these into measurable key results.
Well, in addition to that, I wanted you to see if we can modify some of this because based on the things that we talked to novel about, we will, I&#39;d rather have you put some more time into the things that we need to do from a business side then for development.
So for example, um, the client health dashboard, you&#39;ve already done a lot of development for it. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that you need to spend a lot of time on it this quarter.
Um, other than the other than spending time working with me to show the value to the team and getting them to use it.
Like, I want to try to, um, uh, like go through like almost sorta like we&#39;re, you&#39;re selling a product to them, just like we have, we do to the clients and figuring out how to present this to the team in a way that they&#39;re going to start using it.
Because until now I don&#39;t think no, uh, Ken and Chris have started using this in a meaningful way, and I see a lot of potential from it, even without any doing any more development for it.
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s better for them to put some time into it and show, and just like you have, and for you to also present the value to them a little bit more.
And I have some ideas on that we can talk about, but from a development perspective, maybe cleaning up some of the things and making it a little bit easier, but I don&#39;t think you should spend a lot of time developing it.
Um, and then, but from my operations slash finance perspective, I do want to work with you on figuring out a good hiring plan.
And, um, I, I believe it&#39;s best done by me. You maybe Chris and reel providing input, um, others can provide like in a general input on like, you know, handbooks or questions and stuff like that.
But I feel like people that have been here the longest have more perspective on, uh, the company, the finances, um, I&#39;d rather work, you and I worked together the most and then others can provide input on that.
For example, hearing and hiring point, how do we hire someone, um, create the job descriptions for the people that we need, and then putting that out there and creating an interview process.
So that&#39;s, I&#39;m gonna need your help with that. So incorporating that in here, um, and cutting back on some of the development responsibilities, and then the other area also is, um, I talked to Rio about this also, um, figuring, uh, I want to put some measurable thing in years four and per Rio to being at the office, um, starting February 1st.
And if, um, because there&#39;s two reasons why I want this to happen, one is, you know, we need to be as efficient as possible.
And this is something that can only happen if there is some direct communication.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f263f51fe9a54c85acd4b69eaf102c75</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 13 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David wanted to go over the OKR one more time and give some thoughts on here first, if we, um, great.
If you can turn some of this into more measurable, okay. RS, I&#39;m a key results. Um, but more importantly, what I wanted to highlight is trying to cut back on some of the development items so that, um, you can address a couple of things.
One is I&#39;m going to need your help, Oregon, uh, over the next quarter, building out this hiring plan, writing these job requirements and, um, and, and having a way to get these, um, uh, the two people that we talked about, uh, an account executive and the developer.
So this is, um, something that will be good for you to go through that process with me. So having that and OKR for that, um, and then we can coordinate with other people to get input and help us build that plan.
Um, but it is something that I would like you to help me lead on, uh, that since, um, this is something that, um, one I&#39;d like to have your input on it.
And two, it also is good for, from a, um, but your own experience also to go through this process with me so that we can have something solid that we&#39;re going to use for future hiring plans.
Second thing is, um, I do need you and real, I already spoke to Rio about this, um, having a, um, a plan to be at the office starting February 1st.
Um, ideally, and there&#39;s two reasons why I find this very important one is we&#39;re getting to a point where we&#39;re having a lot of rapid things that are getting done and growing, we&#39;re getting taken on onboarding and it&#39;s important for us to be very efficient.
Um, and that efficiency happens when the team has really good chemistry and are working together. And for me, a lot of times, right now I have many one-on-one meetings with different people to convey information back and forth.
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s getting to a point it&#39;s, it&#39;s not really efficient for me to do this. Um, and, uh, and in the past, we&#39;ve moved fast because people are, are in more direct communication with each other and it doesn&#39;t, it can be, uh, in the beginning, it can just be two days a week.
Um, or for you, even if you can do one day a week next quarter, I mean, of this water and then scale up from there, uh, out as, uh, as the spring time stores, that would even be fine.
Um, and then for Rio, I, I told him that if he, you know, he can&#39;t afford to get a place, um, this is something that we can have, like a hotel or something that he can stay at when he comes down to stay here.
And, um, As for paying for it, this is something that last year when we had adjusted salaries for people to stay in Philly, like after I started stopped paying for the apartment, we, the plan was for you guys to have a salary increase so that you can pay for the apartment.
Um, and so either he&#39;s going to have to like figure out a way to calm it down or.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c042606183e243a2978701a45b030fa1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 17 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So Maria, so first a part of it will be about sites. So we want to introduce Jay I&#39;ll present it as if I&#39;m presenting to the client.
So metrics offers a way to track sites, um, that you&#39;re affiliated with. So these sites are set up under our institutional portal and it is something that can be imported from a spreadsheet.
And the way that it works is we go to sites and we can create each hospital that students are being sent to.
And when they create that site, we can define them as external sites, since they&#39;re not part of the St James university.
And once an external site is created, we can click on it and define any leadership at that institution, plus attach any agreements to it.
So these are affiliation agreements or other contracts that are linked to this specific site. Those are the documents or the main thing that you can add and for leaders, but all of this information is optional and that when you get getting started, the main thing is the site name and the site ID.
And we have it. Um, we have it set up so that we can start adding rotations to it. So once all the sites that are imported under our regular program, admin portal, we have the school of medicine program and in system set up rotations, we are able to upload all of the rotations that are offered at each site.
So when creating a rotation, it would give it a rotation name, rotation code, and link it to a site. So let&#39;s do that here.
Add rotation name code. So code is something that can be created based on, uh, the name of the rotation, select one of these sites.
These are sites that we just went over. You pre create them and it&#39;ll show up on this list, search for it and link it to that.
And sites also, sorry, rotations can also be linked to the curriculum rotation. So remember that we already have curriculum implemented for St.
James, and we can link that to a particular rotation in the curriculum. And for now we&#39;ll skip the rotation directors and administrators, since that&#39;s not going to be set up for St.
James at this time. So once the sites and rotations that are entered, we could also add rotation resources. These are attachments that are linked to a particular rotation.
So if someone is going to family medicine at metrics, hospitals Southeast, we can have a bunch of files that are shared with the students before they start that rotation.
So this could be different forms. They have to complete or different articles they have to read. Um, so if you have any files that are need to be shared with the student that can be done here, now let&#39;s focus on users.
So in metrics, there are four different types of users that can be created. Each of these types of users have different portals associated with them.
So every user metrics has a personal portal and there are four personal portals based on that user type. And if someone is given a, a, a administrative access, whether it be the program admin portal or an institutional admin portal, then we give them an extra, a button here to access those portals.
So if I take away this user&#39;s admin access, then I will just have the personal portal. So I can always toggle into that by clicking on it.
And you can see, this is, this is Perry Cox, and he has the faculty, uh, access. So those are the four user types and inside of each user type, we have use a rolls.
So if I scroll down here, there&#39;s a roles field, and I can define different roles. So user types and the user roles underneath it.
And depending on what their individual&#39;s function is, we can give them a specific role roles can be customized to your institution.
So you can create as many roles as you like. And this is something that we&#39;ll go through in a few minutes, and we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll, um, create faculty, staff, and medical student roles.
So they&#39;re available for you to use. And one more thing to highlight here is, um, site is the same as home institution.
So every user can be linked to a home institution. And this home institution is something that is meant to be their employer.
So if a external or preceptor or attending physician is employed by us or in the hospital, you will select that as a home institution or students.
The home institution is always going to be St James, because that&#39;s who, um, uh, that&#39;s where they&#39;re enrolled. And when it comes to roles, we can also create some specific roles that are tied to external sites.
So if you want to have a, um, site coordinator role, and it&#39;s only linked to external institutions, when you select an external institution, you&#39;ll see that role available.
But if you select the St James site, then you would only show roles that are part of the, uh, St.
James staff and students.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/39c38ba1202e4774b69c874664f100f8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So creating a video for you so that it&#39;d be easier for us to go through everything rather than typing it all out.
And, um, so first thing, yes, it would be very helpful. If you can, uh, start a Google doc, put your dates on there and ask others to do it.
You can share it in the company channel. And, uh, and then once we have it on there, you can also put it your dates on your calendar and block that out as for the OKR.
Um, I went through it and, uh, it&#39;s definitely, uh, a really good start. I may have good points on here.
Uh, one thing that needs to be done is to turn this into the format of an objective and a key results and for the objectives and key results, we want to make sure that you&#39;re turning.
Um, so for example, for this one, one of the objectives could be that you want to, um, become a, a better UX lead, a director or a leader.
And underneath that you may have specific key results that you&#39;re going to put in there saying define and implement, you know, a certain number, certain processes in the company.
Um, so research, design, research plan and implement certain processes, um, and define like kind of either, if you know, what process to implement, like the, for example, you already did that.
We did thing. Um, similar, you, you had talked about the, um, having some mechanism to keep things in sync when it goes into get lab with different ID numbers.
So think about any process that need to be defined. And the key result should, um, will be specifically implementing certain number certain, uh, processes, then implementing it with the team.
Another one could be, um, the, um, um, maybe finding a mentor that is on a larger company as a UX director, um, having a set number of hours that you&#39;re going to dedicate per week for studying leadership in a UX.
Um, so that&#39;s, or another one could be for finding a eh, intern, um, so that you can learn how to mentor a manage peop uh, at, uh, someone.
So that&#39;s, so I would say this needs to be turned into, uh, two or three different measurable key results for one.
And this one, both of those are pretty clear, um, key results. So you can probably group those together with any other, uh, major projects for this quarter as an objective with under an objective that talks about designing functionality for metrics.
So, um, so these are, are talking about designing and getting feedback about metrics features, and so that plus anything that&#39;s like MSPE, um, anything else you can think of that our major project for this quarter, um, can be a measurable key results as what are you going to be completing for that for us?
So that&#39;s one, then there&#39;s two, and then the third one, um, could be related to third objective could be related to user flow diagrams.
So the objective could be improve, um, uh, your knowledge of metrics with creation of by creating user flow diagrams and then define key results as three, each of the three user flow diagrams you&#39;re going to finish.
So, um, so you can plan that out as like, what does it mean to be finishing those three diagrams? So you can say, uh, create and publish user flow diagrams and, um, and, uh, Figma or that, that platform that you used for the retreat, the, where it shows diagrams and flow charts.
So create and publish, uh, um, use of flow diagrams for evaluations, um, use, create and publish user flow diagram for curriculum, and then maybe case logs, pick three modules, and then specifically put those as key results.
So that it&#39;s measurable and where are you going to publish it? And then that will be the third objective with key results.
I don&#39;t think this is something that needs to be a key results. This is sort of just has been on the, uh, on there for a couple of years, couple of quarters.
And I feel like you finished most of it. He sort of does, you can finish that up. If you want to turn this into key results, maybe defining something new, such as I&#39;m going to write a blog article about this.
Um, and that could be a key result. And the other area that you&#39;re doing now is Intercom. So it would be nice if you can fit that into somewhere, maybe under this OKR becoming a UX director, um, you know, putting some measurable key results for Intercom.
So how can you measure that? It could be, um, your key results could be, um, Make sure that Intercom, um, responses are Intercom issues are closed within a, uh, within a week.
So whatever Intercomm issues you&#39;re dealing with, uh, close them within a week. And then that would be a measurable key result.
And that involves like coordinating with other team members and making them getting the responses that you need to answer those and close them in a week.
I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m throwing ideas out there, but we want to think about all the things that you&#39;ll be doing this quarter and trying to turn those into measurable, um, key results.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cadf461ffd0b402ebacd06eb84d9254e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Accepted: Medtrics Demo w/ UT Southwestern UME @ Fri Jan 21, 2022 4pm - 5pm (EST) (Santhosh Cherian) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, uh, Mike. So we had started talking about processes a little bit yesterday, and you did a great job with presenting these two new processes to the team and especially emphasizing the importance of why they should do this to help us speed up your process and making sure things are getting done.
A couple of, uh, um, feedback that I had. One is for this feature requests one, it would be better if we changed that to a form that just pops up so that it doesn&#39;t get posted each time someone clicks on it, otherwise you just have this blank form that gets posted and they had to click on it and open it up.
It just streamline, um, and prevent something from posting until it&#39;s actually completed. And then the other thing is this urgency thing is a very subjective field.
People can write whatever they want in there, and you&#39;re may not get any actionable item from there. I would recommend that it&#39;s better if you use that impact score or impact, um, score that we created for product board.
And I think it was, um, let me see if I can find it So we had an impact 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and And, uh, one was little improvement on user experience.
Um, some improvement on user experience. For four, we can actually tweak this for Um, sorry, dramatic, uh, for all users at one institution, uh, Some improve and on user experience for Users at all institutions Dramatic improvement Of user experience at all institutions Here we go.
So a little improvement, some at one institution, dramatic improvement in one institution, some improvement for all institutions, um, dramatic improvement for all use it at users that all users At all institutions.
So basically if it&#39;s something that is specific to one institution, it&#39;s not going to affect everybody, then it&#39;s lower priority, but if it benefits, everybody gets higher.
So if they can pick one of these options and you can put this text into that dropdown, then you can prioritize that based on this feedback.
Um, and then, and then basically if it&#39;s something that hits this five or four, and if it&#39;s an easy task, we should write it up immediately.
And if it&#39;s something that is not one of these, then you can, um, put it into the product board. So when it asks, gets added to the product board, there&#39;s two places.
It can go. One is the, just putting into the backlog and it just stays there, but it second is putting into the backlog, um, and adding it to the roadmap.
If it gets added to the roadmap, the understanding is we&#39;ll be working on it in the near future, maybe weeks, months, if it&#39;s just added to the product board backlog.
Um, it&#39;s a long-term thing that we&#39;ll come back to it, maybe months down the road. So to summarize, um, um, updating this urgency, to have some sort of like, uh, information that you can make a decision on because otherwise people are going to just put high, medium, and low, and that&#39;s not going to really meet anything.
But if we have this information, then we can use that to decide whether it&#39;s something that should be prioritized or not.
And then once you have that information, you can either add it directly to get lab. If it&#39;s something that&#39;s super important and quick, if it&#39;s not, um, if it&#39;s not, if it&#39;s super important, but not quick, you can add it to the roadmap.
So for short term project, if it&#39;s something that&#39;s not important, but nice to have, it can just go into the backlog and stay there as an idea for us to review some time in the future.
When we have more time and resources.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7dac747c616a4ddfa64f00c1bc154b79</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Fwd: Renewal Time for ARH - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So here&#39;s what&#39;s happening with the ARH. Um, I gave a Ken a script to give a call to her yesterday and asked him, well, ask she, I think he wasn&#39;t able to reach her, but then she sent a follow-up.
He sent a follow-up email asking about the same items and this included any missing, uh, sorry, any new programs changes to the existing number of students and also asking whether they wanted to do something with medical students.
So here&#39;s what she sent back. Um, we are currently awaiting a response from ACG AME regarding our accreditation. So, um, if they have no warning, they&#39;re going to be asking to increase the number of trainees to nine, or sorry, by nine over three years or three more residents per year.
We don&#39;t need to wait for this for us to do the renewal I&#39;m. Um, I don&#39;t know when that&#39;ll happen.
Maybe a few months, they also said that the surgical residency is on hold. Um, she&#39;s working on a new GI fellowship.
If they get approved, they may, they may add that into metrics. And the, she also said agreed that she would want to hear more about the medical students side from 14 of our hospitals.
Um, so I sent her an email, just schedule a demo for that. Um, if the contract is already expired, um, I say we can go ahead and send the renewal and get that paid.
Cause she said, she&#39;s willing to process that. And you can add the, um, add the inflation percentage with that we&#39;ve been adding, um, if it&#39;s not expired or like, um, very close to expiration, we can see if we want to consolidate the students side into that.
Uh, she, she&#39;s gonna probably have to go through some sort of approval process for that. Um, uh, after we give the demo or maybe still be a few weeks until we get everything, uh, signed off on it.
So, um, I&#39;m not a hundred percent sure. Um, which is a better report approach if, um, um, if she&#39;s, if she&#39;s saying that she&#39;s willing to pay right now, maybe best to just get that processed and then we can handle this separately either way, that&#39;s the situation and would also be good for you to, um, uh, document a few of these bullet points somewhere.
Um, so for you have for your record when you&#39;re going, if we don&#39;t remember it on the next year, uh, at least on a renewal time, we&#39;ll, it&#39;ll come up and we ask about their new programs.
So maybe in QuickBooks or notion or somewhere, somewhere, we define that there, they have a GI fellowship that&#39;s coming up and they&#39;re also planning on increasing the number of, uh, I am residents.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3d0dd6fd6de2457d8e4393f26b9ee3ed</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, you win... - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So one or two, uh, instead of, uh, being able to meet, I wanted to just create a video that goes over these things, um, for the time off for the quarter.
Yeah. It would be very helpful if you could start a Google doc and then she put it on a company channel and people can write that in.
Um, you can also put this, the dates that you&#39;re, you&#39;re doing, uh, taken off on your calendar, asked for the  the, um, the, um, the key thing&#39;s going to be is, uh, turning things into a, um, measurable key results.
So you have the objectives and then you have key results underneath it. So being able to turn this, for example, this is a good, uh, objective, uh, but what are the specific items that you want to focus on for this role?
Um, so, you know, complete a certain course or watch, uh, I mean, uh, uh, find a mentor, um, throwing random ideas that you can define those, um, the defined processes.
Cause a big thing here is going to be, um, leading the, for deleting the design department, as you&#39;re you&#39;re already starting to do is how do you interact with different members of the team so that you&#39;re gathering the ideas and learning and putting those into an organized structure and then, uh, prioritizing different projects, um, and then delivering and communicating on the sort of like defining some of those processes could be one of those key results.
Um, but something you need to turn that into a key result, that one or more key results that are measurable.
This, this is a key result here. So it&#39;s sort of saying you&#39;re, you can see that as a measurable key result, um, that can be part of an objective.
And so this is also key result. Um, so for the case study for KP, um, I don&#39;t know if this is really needs to be a key results since it&#39;s been there for a while and you know, it&#39;s not going to be a quarter long project, whatever needs to be, just finish it, you can just finish it.
But I feel like, uh, it&#39;s, it&#39;s been a long, like a couple of quarters and it just needs to be finished.
And then, uh, maybe a key results from this could be, um, like taking it a step further and, um, writing a blog article about it, something cause like internally the case studies one thing, but what we want to focus now on is like, how do we tell the story of metrics to other people?
And if you want to turn this into a key result, it could be something like I&#39;m going to write a blog article about how I did this or, um, or something farther than that.
Then just finishing last quarters then for this is a good key result completing the design for it. So I can work with you on that one.
And Let&#39;s see. Um, And then, um, Yeah, so I would S.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e742a964e48b4385a3ee3fb1f8725272</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So I wanted to, uh, uh, create a video to go over these things. Um, so it&#39;s easier for us to, uh, uh, communicate around that mean typing everything out.
So the first thing is, yes. Uh, it&#39;d be very helpful if you could start a Google doc with your baits on there and then ask others to do that, he put it in the company channel.
You can also put your dates onto your calendar so that it&#39;s, um, marked off. Um, so for OKR, the key things here is going to be turning things into the, an OKR format where you have an objective, um, at most like let&#39;s say ad most three objectives and free to those objectives having, um, let&#39;s say, uh, um, about three key results.
Um, I&#39;m just thinking about, because you can decide that for yourself, but you need to have an objective and then key results underneath that.
Um, so that in each of those key results would be measurable. Um, I&#39;ll also send you that Google video. It&#39;d be good to review that also also that he can see how that&#39;s, how the structure is.
So the first thing here, this is a good objective. Um, or if you want to turn this into key results is sort of devoting X amount of time, um, per week on what is the specific things that you&#39;re going to do?
Um, or there&#39;s two ways to do. One is you can say, I want to, um, research and implement a successful strategies for being a UX director.
And then underneath that you can have specific items that you&#39;ll be doing this quarter towards that goal. So one of them could be something like, um, define certain document and communicate certain processes.
So you can list out those processes or kind of generally say, they&#39;re going to try to define, um, cause you already started doing that with the winded stuff.
There may be more processes that need to be defined. That could be one of the things and you can reach some of those may require research.
Then another one could be, if you have, if you want to find a, a mentor, um, on LinkedIn, someone that works at a larger company as the director of UX and seeing if that person would be meeting, willing to meet with you, like once a month or something that we could be another one, another one could be, you know, a certain, um, courses or articles or something that you want to dedicate X amount of time per week to building your leadership skills as a UX director.
So I&#39;m not sure what that would be. I&#39;m just throwing ideas out, spending a little bit more time, defining this into measurable key results.
So this one is already a key result. So, um, you&#39;re going to be working on designing and, um, uh, different features this quarter.
And this could be, that could be an objective where design a high priority functionality for metrics or something along those lines.
And then you can put something like these two under there. Um, cause those are all things that are designing and testing and maybe there&#39;s other projects that we need to complete, but the objective there would be something along designing features and then putting these things under there.
Um, so that&#39;d be the second objective with a couple of key results and anything else that you want to add.
And then there&#39;s the, um, user flow diagrams for three of the metrics, uh, modules. So this one, um, could be a, an objective for this could be, um, create the customer.
Um, the objective could be create a, um, create customer experience or sorry, build user full diagrams. That could be the objective.
And then underneath that you could define the three metrics modules that you&#39;re going to create the, um, user flow diagrams for.
And I believe the, um, curriculum, um, evaluations and maybe case logs could be the three that you start with. Cause they&#39;re heavily used the scheduling stuff.
I feel like it&#39;s really complicated and maybe something that, um, can wait, but curriculum is also complicated evaluations and case logs, um, could be a good, good three to start with.
And that will involve you working with me, Chris and creating this map. And the purpose of this is also to help you master the system.
So you&#39;re able to go no, the hard work from end to end, um, rather than just focusing on specific areas as you&#39;re building them.
And then once it&#39;s built, this is also something that can be used to new team members on how things work for this particular one.
I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t feel like this is something that needs to be a K risk key results. Cause we had it in there on the thing for the last couple of quarters.
And the best thing is to finish this as a finish or whatever it is. If you want to turn this into a key results, I guess like the marketing thing, maybe you can have a marketing OKR and say, turn the case, study into a blog post or something along those lines.
So that it&#39;s not just finishing the case study. It&#39;s actually, um, doing something new with it and having a measurable, I&#39;m saying this is well turned us into something that can be marketed.
Um, Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cfc6f147145e4a988c77decec517e471</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Editing Contract Renewal Process - Tettra - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this process is something that is used by customer success, and it&#39;s going to be used today once a year when we&#39;re renewing our contracts.
As we know, most of our institutions sign an annual agreement with us and our contract says that it&#39;ll auto renew unless they canceled 60 days in advance.
But before we send over any paperwork, we want to make contact with our primary contact at the institution. So the primary contact is usually the person that is our champion at the organization.
And this person is usually the first person that reached out to us initially for the demo. And it was communicating with us to what the sales process, and then what&#39;s also involved with the onboarding and we want to reach out to this individual and because they&#39;re going to give us a real feedback on how things are going with metrics and also discuss any potential new opportunities, as well as address any budget concerns, if they&#39;re considering canceling or, uh, or, uh, cutting back on metrics.
Uh, this individual may not be the primary decision maker and, uh, um, but this is going to be the person that&#39;s closest to us when it comes to metrics.
And when it, when we do this renewal, it&#39;s always important to call first and wait, uh, sorry, call first and then send an email the after, um, we try to reach them and then saying, um, we&#39;re reaching out because of this reason and then send an email immediately afterwards saying, okay,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/197af6ed93b94246983b44b2d6d579c1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Re: Inbox (2,176) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 11 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So I&#39;m working on something for MSU and it&#39;s a few different things, but, um, one area that I wanted to ask, uh, your opinion on is, um, for them to be able to track whether a student has met his certain number of weeks, um, on the, uh, has been scheduled to a certain number of weeks of, um, specific rotations.
So as a, for graduation, um, we pull up a, so this was, uh, from today&#39;s implementation meeting with them. Um, if I look at this complex document that they sent over, we can see that for, um, required rotations and electives.
They have categorized them into different types of rotations. Um, and then we, they have to make sure that the students are meeting a certain number of weeks of that.
And they just basically looking at the block schedule and being able to, uh, uh, tell whether it&#39;s met and if they&#39;re moving all of the scheduling into metrics, um, um, it&#39;ll be, it will be an extra work for them to be able to manage this and this other platform.
So I&#39;m working, um, on a thing with, um, a plan for how we can handle this specifically the, for the query, um, where if someone is scheduled on the block schedule and that rotation is linked.
So we have this rotation that&#39;s in here, that&#39;s linked to a curriculum rotation, and then that curriculum rotation is linked to a graded rotation.
So it&#39;s, um, user schedule has a rotation rotation is, uh, linked to the curriculum rotation, uh, and then curriculum core slash core rotation is linked to the greater rotation.
So if that&#39;s the link that exists, is it going to be possible for us to create a page where they can select a student and it&#39;ll show all the graded rotations that are required the number of weeks, and then next to that, um, each item showing the user&#39;s schedule from the block schedule.
So it&#39;ll be basically one column chose the rotation named from graded rotation. And then the next column would show the actual schedule for that rotation from the block schedule.
And then the third column would show the number of weeks, um, that they were scheduled for. And the fourth would basically show the, um, for the number of weeks, we already have that requirement being captured now under the graded course where we have a weeks into your field.
So if we have this field and then, um, for each of these graded course rotations, being able to pull up the appropriate scheduled, um, user schedule using the relationship that exists from block schedule, uh, assignment, uh, to the rotation, to the curriculum rotation, to the graded course rotation, if that is possible, um, or if it&#39;s going to be something that we should look of a another relationship, cause it&#39;s, I don&#39;t know how there&#39;s like four levels deep, and if that&#39;s something that&#39;s gonna cause a speed issue.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d109a029c2564903a82f030892ea068d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>8 - 1/11 Implementation Meeting - User Permissions &amp; Scheduling Imports - Google Slides - 11 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So for implementation at MSU, we&#39;ve come across so many issue with being able to track the requirements for graduation and whether the students have been scheduled for the appropriate number of rotations.
This is something they track in another system. They send us a screenshot of this, where they have picked up a student, uh, uh, picked a student and he can see all the requirements and whether they have completed it.
Um, so I have a general idea of how to handle this and talk to, um, Rio about some of these things.
One area that I wanted to get your opinion on is right now we have the user schedule and that user schedule has a rotation.
That rotation is linked to a curriculum using the curriculum link here. And that&#39;s the curriculum course, um, uh, of curriculum curriculum, course rotation object.
And this curriculum course rotation objects will eventually be linked to the graded course rotation, um, where we are giving them the ability to define the number of weeks that are required for graduation.
So the question is with this relationship, is it possible for us to efficiently create a page where I can select a student and see all of the graded course rotations that they have to complete and, um, show which assignments have been made on the block schedule, um, for those, for that particular rotation.
So if I have a family medicine rotation, that&#39;s added to a graded curriculum and I select a student, I want to know that a family medicine rotation has been scheduled for January 1st to January 31st.
And that information will be coming from the user schedule via the relationship that exists from graded course rotation to the curriculum course rotation to the, um, this rotation and the assignment that&#39;s on the block schedule.
It also has like three or four levels deep of in terms of linking. And if it&#39;s possible to pull up that information efficiently and show it on a table so they can look at it and verify the student has everything scheduled for graduation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/48bc310e70214f579c8ec2c4e52a3963</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Accepted: Medtrics Demo w/ UT Southwestern UME @ Fri Jan 21, 2022 4pm - 5pm (EST) (Santhosh Cherian) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 12 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, um, reviewing, um, some of the things that, uh, we started talking about yesterday about processes. So we did it, it was really good.
A presentation that you did going over these two things. Uh, if you like, uh, you also emphasize the reason why, um, they should, everybody should use this process.
So, um, couple of, uh, uh, feedback about the items itself. Um, so for the new feature requests, um, uh, one, so when you, when you click on this, it will post something to this, and then you have to click on the form.
If you look at the other one, it will just bring up the form and they can fill it out and submit this.
So that way there is, um, um, it doesn&#39;t just pop up in here, uh, for everybody to see until they have something to submit.
So you might want to consider changing that. So, um, right now the sample that you did today, anybody can just open it up and start submitting it.
Um, so minor thing, if you want to try changing that. But the one thing that I would like to try to do here is, um, this urgency is a very subjective thing.
And instead of asking high, medium, low, which doesn&#39;t really give us any actionable information, um, it&#39;s better to give a dropdown as I, um, how quickly should this be completed, um, and give them a dropdown that says, um, add to get lab immediately, um, add to, um, um, product board, um, add, add to product board for, um, short-term term short-term project and add to product board backlog for longterm project.
So this way it&#39;s giving you something actionable, what you should do, the re uh, if it&#39;s simple, supposed to, to get lab immediately, then you can, we can write that up and put it into good lab.
If it&#39;s a short term thing, we&#39;ll add it to product board and make sure that it&#39;s on the roadmap so we can address it in the near future.
If it&#39;s something that is for long-term, we just add it to the appropriate category in the product board, backlog, and get to it whenever we get it and get to it.
And it is, um, and this applies for both of them. And the other piece of it is, um, since in product board, we do have the impact and effort scores.
Um, we could add a dropdown, um, for a least the impact score and the impact score we had a in product board is like one through four.
And, uh, we can ask the person who is submitting it, um, not to put a one through four score, but, um, you could, they can put in, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b4f602a1408b4c1abb1d407007fa659a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Inbox (2,176) - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 11 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>so Rio and I had a call about the things that we&#39;re talking about, the MSU meeting today. And here&#39;s a summary of that.
Let me know if you have any thoughts on this. So the first thing is for graded, um, the graded curriculum courses, um, we&#39;re going to move the mandatory slash elective to the graded so that we&#39;re going to see mandatory elective here and not on the other one.
And then when a course rotation from curriculum is linked to this, it will show what was the parent, um, selection.
So the course current inherit the mandatory, um, then E actually this, this one, um, we don&#39;t need. So what we&#39;re going to add is a second category option here, so that if you select a rotation or a course, you can sub categorize it into something like, um, surgical and nonsurgical, like, uh, MSU has asking about.
And then the category itself will be managed on the page somewhere. And it&#39;s going to be, um, have a way to specify number of weeks that are required for graduation for that category.
So if you have surgical, um, graduation requirements, you can say you need 20 weeks of surgical, um, rotations completed. And then the actual number of rotations that are available, maybe hundred weeks worth of, um, um, rotations that are available, but you only have to do 20 weeks to graduate.
So each item in here will have how many weeks that rotation is. The category we&#39;ll have the, uh, what&#39;s required for graduation for mandatory.
The number of the candidate for the category will equal the number of, um, core rotations that are in there. And for electives, the category is going to be less.
Um, usually it&#39;s going to be less than the sum of the weeks of all the rotations that are in there.
And, uh, the weeks are going to be tracked as an integer field. So in the case of rotations, it&#39;ll be weeks in the case of courses, it&#39;ll be credits, but it&#39;s going to be the same field, um, that track that.
So it can have elective courses, uh, for a few credits and or elective rotations that are for certain number of weeks.
So once this is set up with the category and the, um, rotations courses, we&#39;re going to have a separate page created in schedules, a section that will be modeled after benefits, where they can select a role, see a list of all the students, and then they can expand it and it&#39;ll see show the category of the graded course rotation.
And then if you expand it, it&#39;ll show each of the requirements under there and what they were scheduled to. And it rolls up to see whether they&#39;re meeting the requirements for that particular section or not.
And the way that we&#39;re going to get this information from the schedule is through the link from the rotation to the curriculum, to the graded, um, graded course.
So hopefully that query is going to be fine if, um, where, if they&#39;re scheduled to a rotation on the block schedule, that rotation is going to be linked to a curriculum rotation.
And that curriculum rotation is going to be linked to a graded, uh, correct, uh, graded curriculum rotation rate of course rotation.
And that&#39;s how, when we expand this, it&#39;ll show the graded and then it&#39;ll show the details of whether they&#39;re scheduled to the number or the start date and end date and the number of weeks it is by dividing it by seven and showing the number and what&#39;s actually required.
Um, so I&#39;m going to work with Mike on the designs for these two. And, um, and, um, Rio&#39;s working on making these other changes that are bolded.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7f9cf570b19e4ec082e40924f126efef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loan payback - Budget - Google Sheets - 9 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So first thing that I want to update you on is I&#39;ve, um, started this stream between, uh, both of us allowed you to this tomorrow, um, July you now, so that we have a place to track any operations slash finance items that we&#39;re discussing.
I know there is a one-on-one, but this is more general company discussions. The one-on-ones can be specific to anything related to, uh, you, so first thing that I want to go over was I reviewed the debt sheet and for Ben Franklin, uh, Matt Terry relieve a that&#39;s all coming from the document that&#39;s right.
And then this is, should be coming from QuickBooks. So I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s right for do things the, for the salary, for my deferred salary.
So this was a metrics liabilities document from, um, um, while ago that I had put together wanted to make sure that this was capturing it because it looks like it starts at 2019 to 2024.
Um, so, but my first salary started after my four years was up. So 2013 to 20 14, 20 14 to 20 15, 20 15, 20 16, 20 16 and 2017.
So July, 2017 onwards. So this was, um, where it had started. And then, and then for all of these items in here, there were a couple of items that had to be cleared and cleared up in QuickBooks.
I&#39;m not sure if that was ever done. Um, let&#39;s see. So this was the expenses. This was the deferred salary, and this was the loans up to July, June, 2019.
And I believe I mashed all of these into QuickBooks. Um, so there were some notes here. So I wanted to just confirm that this was, uh, accurate and any issues here was a address.
If not, I can, uh, if you&#39;re not sure I can look through it again and work with you on clearing that up so that we have it cleaned up so far going, uh, going forward and then work with Jeremy&#39;s person to add it into QuickBooks.
So that&#39;s for, um, this salary and then for 2021 onwards for me, Rio and Chris, we would have that part that is getting paid.
And the part that is getting added as debt until we hit the 1.5, um, milestone 1.5 million milestone. So that was from October onwards.
So I&#39;m not sure if, uh, you didn&#39;t want to put that on here or if it&#39;s something that&#39;ll be kept somewhere else.
Um, that was from October 1st onwards. This is for the contract that you made, uh, recently. And So depths are, I was researching and recently I don&#39;t think that company exists anymore.
Um, I am connected to their people on LinkedIn. They&#39;re a founder and, um, Mark Martin who worked on our company, if they have star started a crypto startup and it&#39;s been a completely different company.
So, uh, we&#39;ll keep it on our books for now, but I have to see if they exist. And if this is something that we need to pay back.
So to summarize, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/65462499ca2e41dab4371399d5fc22f8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loan payback - Budget - Google Sheets - 10 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So I had a chance to review the, uh, things that were pending in my queue and wanted to send you a video to summarize everything.
First thing, one or two, a share is this new stream that I started and it&#39;s under operations and finance under other streams only shared with you.
This is to keep track of any operations slash finance items that we have pending and from our meetings or videos or discussions and your other one-on-one can be used for any personal discussions, such as, okay, ours.
This will be something that&#39;s for related to the company items and added a few things here. I&#39;m gonna add a call for Tuesday for us to have another discussion related to novel.
And at that time we can go through these and also put any other things that we had discussed, uh, that require follow up on this board.
So it&#39;s easier to track. So today I wanted to go over a couple of things. The first thing is I went over the, uh, debt repayment items here, and things to discuss is the salary here for ashy loan.
A question I had was whether from this document, uh, any items that needed to be fixed was fixed in QuickBooks, such as like incorrectly classified on QuickBooks.
Um, there was another comment here, $900 for Chris&#39; account. So I had, um, went into and mashed up all the sound, all the items in here with, um, what was in QuickBooks and put some of the dates here and highlighted anything that had some questions or issues.
Um, I don&#39;t know if you remember if this was a, a dress, if not, I want to work with you to make sure we clean up anything so that this doesn&#39;t turn into a problem of confusion.
If it needs to be reviewed later by some other investor. The second a four item is for the deferred salary.
I saw that on this document, the deferred salary starts on 21, 1 20 19. And then, um, for, but for me, it actually started on 2017 after my sheriffs had vested for four years.
So the first four years there was no salary, it was completely shares. And then after four years, um, I started adding a salary that was the same as Chris and 2017 on worst.
There was a salary that was deferred. So on to check if that was factored in here anywhere then for 2021 onwards, for me, Chris and Rio, we had us created a new contract from October 1st on worst, where we had part of our salary adjustment with part of it being deferred until we hit a 1.5 million revenue milestone.
So maybe, uh, you had, uh, some, a different way to track that. Uh, we wanted to check with you to see what the plan was for that.
It was basically part of it was going to be paid. The other half a part is going to be fade once we hit 1.5 in revenue.
Um, so those are the items related to this sheet. I haven&#39;t checked up any everything else I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s correct.
Um, um, I only had a chance to look through mine to confirm. So one thing to note here is, um, we should put all of this into QuickBooks.
Um, one item that I would not put in yet is Def are, um, I, there, I don&#39;t think this company exists anymore.
I believe the founders started in different company and I don&#39;t, uh, I&#39;m not sure if we need to repay this.
Um, I&#39;ll do some more research, but before we put it into QuickBooks, uh, I&#39;ll confirm that. So that&#39;s related to the loan payback.
Um, second item is I did get the things to approve things on Carta. I went and looked into it for, um, I want to add a question about the, uh, the most recent one you sent.
Uh, so back, uh, when we had started, um, our discussions, um, regarding finance and helping manage that, uh, we had put in for the, um, into the contract for, um, the 24 months of the thousand shares to assume the role of typical responsibilities of CFO.
And, um, and then the plan was at the time you Rio and, um, marina were the only ones that doing development.
And the understanding was you had to put in a lot more actual work between the two responsibilities to get caught up on finances and get everything organized.
And, uh, it was a lot of extra time. That&#39;s why we had discussed the extra, uh, 24 months of thousand shares.
And, uh, during that time period, uh, we had, um, uh, ended up hiring multiple developers to take over, uh, you know, uh, development responsibilities, um, for, um, uh, to support you, uh, support the team and the development responsibilities.
So what I see here, I wanted to confirm as you have the 20,000, that is a four year vesting period.
And then from here, um, this started in August to December, um, that was a 5,000 shares. And then from the second one was from, um, Um, 1, 1, 2.
So that would be a 12 plus of five, um, 17 months. And then the remaining would be, um, Uh, remaining would be a four to get to the 24 will be 17 plus three plus four.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a394a84f4f254b2aa24035b8e549be0f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Knowledge Base Settings | Stonly - 4 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So Ken, I&#39;m looking at the, uh, settings and, uh, here&#39;s what I need to have updated to make the task, um, should be easy as just linking the new URLs.
Um, so when we go to acknowledge base, we have the three knowledge base that you have set up here. Um, the, for the administrator, one, one thing that I wanted a separate from this discussion is like there&#39;s links at the Thompson&#39;s feature requests link into comm link.
It takes us to this spreadsheet for ostomy tracking, probably want to remove that. Um, but if I go to the general setting here is access control to everyone search index.
Um, search engine index should be disabled for the domain name. Um, we would want to make this, um, unique for each of the knowledge basis.
So it can be metrics dash metrics, admin dot, stoli.com. Um, but tricks I haven&#39;t done, uh, uh, stolen.com metrics, trainee dust only not common metric educated us, the only.com.
And then what I&#39;m going to do is have them replace the link in the left nav for the different, uh, portals.
Um, and that&#39;ll be, allow us to get it published, um, down the road. We need to consider using the, um, a custom domain and seeing if we can, uh, hide some more of the things, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2ce4fbb1f1bc432c982f6b44816a5bb5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Knowledge Base Settings | Stonly - 4 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ken. So under knowledge base, if you go to the three knowledge base, uh, sections, administrator trainee and edge educator, um, there&#39;s a couple of things to do here.
One is making sure that everything&#39;s okay. We want to, uh, remove these links at the top for feature requests in our comm link, because it takes you to the stolen lead tracking spreadsheet, um, so that you don&#39;t want to, and also says Maria and metrics lab here for contact us on, uh, update that.
Then if we go to the general settings for each of these knowledge bases, we want to make sure that it&#39;s, um, we can activate it.
Um, the search engine visibility should be disabled. The diff uh, default domain. We want to customize it for each knowledge base.
So it could be metrics, admin dust, only.com metrics, educator Dosta only.com metrics, trainee, dost only.com. And then we can use that to publish it to the different portals, um, in metrics and, um, the name description, the knowledge base.
Um, we can, we want to update that here, putting some description here for each of the knowledge bases yeah. Done.
And later on, we can also do some more custom design work, but I don&#39;t need that right now. But the key thing is the setup page may having a separate domain for each of them and making sure that this search engine is disabled so that it doesn&#39;t show up on Google and then, um, activating.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a7785a77e8af46cea7318786636778b5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 9 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So had a chance to review, uh, some of the things that were pending on my end for a finance.
And first thing I want to say is I started a streams, um, op on other streams for operations slash finance, and I&#39;ve added you to it.
So this way we have a dedicated place to keep all these projects or tasks organized from meetings and, uh, other discussions we, we do have that one-on-one also, but that can be related to your personal discussions and topics, unless I just say, okay, ours, and this could be really, this is related to the operations and finance right now.
I&#39;ve only added you to it. Um, and we can keep it that way for now. And then, because this is going to be related to anything that I&#39;m working with you directly on.
So for the three things I wanted to go over today, um, first thing is this, this, uh, stream, um, second is the, um, is the, um, that stuff.
And then there it is a Carta had a question about that, and I&#39;ve also put some items in here. I&#39;m going to set up a call for Tuesday for you on item, meet, to go over any, any follow-up discussions and also finalize a plan for novel.
I&#39;ll put that on the calendar so we can talk through it then. So about the debt few things I wanted to point out here.
Uh, thank you for putting, putting this together. It&#39;s a great summary, um, for, I didn&#39;t look into Ben Franklin and Matt Terry, um, but from this, uh, loan, uh, role, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s coming from QuickBooks.
And I also wanted to confirm that, um, any issues with this document, uh, this was that document I put in put together a while ago that organizes my debt and wanting to make sure that any issues that were mentioned here, like in, in incorrectly classified or, uh, $900 from Chris&#39;s account, these things were, uh, corrected in QuickBooks.
If you have, I know it&#39;s been a while. If you have any questions about it, I can work with you on it to make sure that it&#39;s all cleaned up.
And then the second part is on this sheet. I had a defer salary starting at 2017. Um, after four years of my, like the first four years, I had no salary because it was all shares.
And then after the fifth year onwards, that&#39;s when I started adding a, um, salary. And then this, I didn&#39;t see it here starting from 2017 onwards.
So want to make sure that it&#39;s captured here somewhere? I&#39;m not sure if they, if you, if this was something that, um, that was a calculator into the count into the math somehow.
So at 2017 onwards capturing that or ex or discussing how it was addressed and sorry, here, not under loan under this role.
And for 2021, after October 1st, 2021, myself, Chris and Rio, we had that new contract drafted where we had some debt being created, uh, to be paid out when we hit the, uh, uh, $1.5 million revenue milestone.
So if is that something that is being captured somewhere else or will that be also be added here? So that was my question there then for, so that&#39;s everything here.
And then for, um, expenses, I am assuming that this is coming from here also. Um, so again, let me know if that is accurate.
Let&#39;s see. And one other item that I wanted to put on here is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to reimburse myself this, uh, anyway, but for now I want her to have it on the, on the record for, uh, what I put in it was the 2200 rent that I was paying for a year, um, for north by Northwest.
Um, it was, I believe I paid it out of my personal account because, um, that was, uh, for my personal account because of, um, the way that Jeremy said we can&#39;t have rent being paid from the company.
Um, so anyway, so that was 2200 times 12. So at 26, 400. So I&#39;m not expecting that to be easily, uh, reimbursed, but I&#39;d like to at least have it documented and then have a discussion with Jeremy, if that&#39;s something that is ever can be, uh, accounted for.
So that&#39;s related to the, um, the loan repayment and a debt. The second thing that I wanted to talk about was a Carta.
Um, I did look through everything that I needed to sign, and I had a question about the, uh, the new one that I needed to sign is this, uh, for the, the, the second year of the financial responsibilities, because, uh, I remember from our initial discussions and from the paperwork, it was four years of the best thing, period, um, and shares associated with it.
There was a end of one year that was a $60,000, uh, uh, bonus for meeting milestones. I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s captured in this one.
And then it was 24 months of, um, for finance. And the reason we had talked about that, um, 24 months, a thousand shares per month for CFL responsibilities, um, was because at the time when we had started, it was only you marina and Rio are the, were the only developers that had to do everything.
And there was extra work to be done for finance and cleanup. And the assumption was, um, first 24 months, either we find someone else or decrease the, um, responsibilities of the development.
So, um, the, the, um, after that first six months or so we started hiring several additional developers. And my, my, uh, thoughts here is that 24 months was the time that we had, uh, accounted for.
And then we addressed the, uh, um, the shortage of developers so that there was decreased, uh, responsibilities related to being the, uh, um, primary backend developer.
And then I also, at the, at that time, um, you know, did not take out any, um, did not take out any of my investments.
That was that loan that I took out was planning on taking out after Kaiser, but because we needed, we, we decided to hire all those developers.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/390295be47d7466782f2337c8f4fa43e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma - 3 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning can hope you had a good weekend. Um, I wanted to follow up on our discussion on Friday because I felt that we didn&#39;t really get, um, through our talk and, uh, I was also, uh, rushed and frustrated.
So I wanted to explain myself and also get in to get, give you a few more, um, ideas for your meeting today.
So first about the Sony discussion, I thought about it a little bit more, and I wanted to explain why I got frustrated.
It, it, it, it, wasn&#39;t something that I was trying to blame you for not finishing the project or getting us having to extend the deadline.
Sorry. The reason I got frustrated was because of the unclear, um, communication. So initially when we had met you and I had talked about, um, Maria, not delivering on those items that you needed and you needed my help to talk to her.
And I had a meeting with her, um, about those three items. Cause you said you needed her to finish those and you were gonna finish the, uh, the rest and we&#39;re going to be done on Wednesday and then went on Wednesday.
Um, you had wrote on the huddle that you would need another 12 days of sorry, another week of 12 hours a day of writing to get it finished.
Um, that, that for me, when I read that I was like, this is not really consistent with what we had talked about.
Cause initially it was just the only thing that you needed from Maria was those three articles. And, um, so, and then when we got on the call, you said it was just those articles that was red, still pending, everything was done.
So that unclear communication about what was done and what was not done was what made me frustrated. Um, I, you know, rather, um, have the information on the progress, um, and then we can get through it and then I&#39;m able to more effectively provide help if needed.
Um, so about the Maria not finishing it also, it is something that I should have done a better job with giving her a deadline.
Um, I, it was, I went, I met with her, gave us those three articles and which require her to, um, get videos from me because she didn&#39;t have enough context to write all of it cause she&#39;s new to the team.
So I made her two of the videos the next day and the third video, I only was able to get to it after the weekend.
Um, when I was assuming that she knew that it was Wednesday, that we were trying to publish everything cause she was in the huddle.
So what I could have done a better job saying this needs to be done by this day so that we can get it done anyway.
Um, what I want to emphasize is it&#39;s not necessarily the getting it done, that part, that I&#39;m, um, uh, that frustrated me was, you know, having a more clear communication of if it&#39;s not done what&#39;s pending and what real help that I see you need.
Um, and it&#39;s the, you know, the 12 hours a day for seven days, um, that was still pending. That made me frustrated.
Um, but in the future, will it be good from your end? If you can be more clear with that. And from my end, I&#39;ll try to, I want to try to get you the help that you need to get projects done.
Um, first being held again, getting Maria to help you with some of these projects and the second being, working more closely with you to build up the skills so that you can pull people and get help that you need, um, on your own.
So starting with the sec, getting Maria to help you I&#39;ll have some pointers for you, um, to be more effective in getting, getting, um, her to complete these projects.
Um, I put together a few videos. I&#39;ll send it to you. You can watch it on your own time. So the first thing is when it comes to communicating someone with ADHD and managing that person, um, you want to try to give a written follow-up after a meeting.
So they&#39;re clear on the expectation and then give a deadline saying, how can you have this done by a certain time, make sure that they&#39;re okay with that.
And, but, and then put it, maybe put a calendar event to follow up on that day, um, and then prioritize their requests.
So if they, if you&#39;re giving them something and they&#39;re saying that they&#39;ll get it done by a certain day, ask if what else is, are they working on that may interfere with that and see if you need to help them prioritize that.
Um, and it&#39;s because a person may get requests from multiple people. You want to make sure that your request is in there somewhere with the deadline.
And if you don&#39;t give a deadline, uh, someone with ADHD will, there&#39;s often multitasking and it may get sidetracked by other projects and don&#39;t, they don&#39;t get to it until later.
The, the other part is giving them one project at a time, because if you give them five things, a person with ADHD will start working on all five of them.
And some of them may not get completed in time. So it&#39;s better to focus on one request at a time, um, and then continue with more things afterwards.
And then the other, uh, aspect of it is there is something called hyperfocus and the term for ADL, ADHT where an individual with ADHD.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4f9741b4606a4cec83ea9a27310f9638</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CSM Team Performance Metrics That Matter – CSM Practice - 2 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ken. So I felt like our conversation on Friday was not a complete and partly because a us going back and forth, I didn&#39;t really want that to get into a, a, a, um, a session where you felt like you were getting blamed for something not being done.
I want to, uh, spend a little bit time explaining what happened and from my perspective, and hopefully that we can avoid that miscommunication in the future.
I also want to spend a little bit more time expanding on tips for helping, uh, or working with Maria, and then some more time on, okay, ours.
So the first thing about the Stoney discussion. So here here&#39;s what happened to why I got frustrated. Um, the, initially when you had said you were going to get it done by Wednesday, we had met and you had asked me to meet with Maria and how you need her to finish those curriculum guides.
Um, so based on that, I had a meeting with her and then I told her that we need to, uh, have those curriculum guides finished.
So she was not able to do that herself. So she was, would depending on me to make those videos. So the first two videos I made it, uh, I think the next day after I met with her, and then the last one, I only made it after the weekend.
Um, I&#39;m thinking that maybe I didn&#39;t give her emphasize the deadlines and having it done by a certain date. I said, this needs to be done.
I, I was assuming that, uh, she knew that it was Wednesday goals since we hadn&#39;t met. New had mentioned, mentioned that in the huddle anyway, so that I, I, you know, I feel like I could have done a better job with, uh, making sure that it was done on that by that day.
Um, but as for the, the, the reason I got frustrated, um, with the, our discussion was on Wednesday. When you had wrote that on the huddle, as that in order to finish this, it requires another, uh, 12 hours of day of writing from you, uh, until the seventh.
Um, I, so my first impression was that something was not communicated and there was, uh, cause we, when we initially talked, you had mentioned that it was, uh, only the curriculum guides that you need help with the rest of you are going to have it done.
So I didn&#39;t really understand the whole 12 hours a day for a week. Um, so, um, it was either something wasn&#39;t done, um, or something was miscommunicated, um, or I felt like it, you know, maybe something I don&#39;t know anyway, so that, that, and then when we got on the call on Friday, um, I was trying to figure out what exactly happened.
And you said everything was done, um, except for Maria&#39;s park. Um, and that&#39;s what was needed to be written, which I still didn&#39;t understand what the, uh, the 12 hours time was for, for, uh, for a week.
Anyway, I&#39;m not, I, I fully understand the time that you put in. I know that I saw the articles and I know that you put in a lot of time or it, it, you know, it&#39;s not about necessarily always getting it done and meeting the expectations or having a done it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;d be helpful if we have a clear line of communication about the, um, like having some thing that I can rely on as this is home, this is when it&#39;s going to be done.
This is how much is left. Um, so when, you know, when you&#39;re you say for going from, I&#39;m going to, we&#39;re going to have it done by Wednesday and then 12 hours of work per day.
That&#39;s what led me to that frustration. I was like, I, it was this unknown variable that was thrown in there.
Um, and then from my end, I&#39;m going to also work towards a help getting you the help that you need to do some of these projects.
And, uh, um, that is in two ways. One is with Maria helping you. And the two is I also want to help you get the help that you need yourself.
And then that, and I feel like even within the team itself, you can pull people to help you, but I want to teach you or show you what is the good strategies for doing that over the next quarter, by meeting with you on a regular basis, because, you know, you don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t really need to say, have that some sort of authority or anything to do that.
It&#39;s something that you just have to build the trust with the people, and they will help you with whatever projects.
Um, and then we just need to plan that out and I&#39;ll help you do that. Um, cause a lot of times is just about how it was presented and we&#39;ll go through that together when we get to the next quarter and different projects.
So tips on for the short term, um, tips on working with, uh, Maria, the, I put together a few videos.
I don&#39;t, you don&#39;t really have to watch all of it before meeting with her. So I&#39;m going to just summarize, summarize it.
You can explore it more if you want to the first. Um, so, uh, with her ADHD, there&#39;s certain skills and there are certain weaknesses.
And, you know, I spend a lot of my time from medical school residency and working in metrics, having systems in place to, uh, maximize the strengths and then try to control the Weaknesses.
And when it comes to working with someone with AAC, one of the things that you want to do is make sure that you understand the strengths and the weaknesses.
So the first, the, the strength is going to be from the ADHD brain, someone that has ADHD, we&#39;re very good at making connections with different ideas and putting things together.
So, you know, when a normal or neuro-typical what they call a person, looks at a problem, or look deals with a situation they&#39;re going a linear manner.
They&#39;re saying, this is what I&#39;m working on, and this is what I need to get done. Um, or when we&#39;re in a meeting, they see certain things that are within the framework of what their brain is working on for someone that has ADHD.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/518887c2753f4cf1bef83f01350a4b63</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Proposal Review - Google Slides - 4 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So here is a summary of the St. James, uh, discovery discussions. And this is a tentative timeline. And, um, I made this in Figma, but I&#39;m sure David Ward is going to make it into a fancier Gantt chart.
So the, they already completed the curriculum. And then right now we&#39;re going to start off with the clerkship component then, uh, figuring out a way to do their grades and metrics for clerkship and, um, um, all of their rotations and eventually being able to automate the MSPE.
And I believe they also mentioned ESSA. So that&#39;s something that we can try to address with them in the beginning, going back to this, um, outline.
So clinical schedules, the big picture of how St. James is different than most schools is they have third party contractors that work with them to get students clinical spots.
So they would contract out to these companies who would find them clinical spots, and they would then schedule, let them know this person is available to go to this particular hospital.
And then, um, St James would put them on a schedule. And when the evaluations are completed, it goes to this third party and they send over a zip file with all the evaluations at the end of that particular rotation.
So it gets a little trickier because they don&#39;t have a way to get this third party companies to get into metrics right now, eventually they&#39;re going to try to convince them to do so.
Um, from an implementation standpoint, what we&#39;re going to do is set up all of their sites, all of their, um, rotations that they offered.
And then they will create separate block schedules for each hospital that they can send their students to. And then as they become aware of the students&#39; schedules, so the third party will contact them, or the student will find a rotation and contact them.
The M the, uh, St. James administrators will then update that block schedule to reflect that. And the student will be able to see that in their portal student is not going to necessarily depend on metrics and know their schedule, because it&#39;s, they&#39;re gonna already know that from the third party or from the fact that they found their own rotation, we&#39;re documenting it for the sake of evaluation and grades in the future.
So a sites first rotations, and then separate block schedules for each of their hospitals that the students will be going to.
And then the, this is, uh, a, a diagram that we presented to them on how that will work metrics will have a centralized schedule and the students or the, um, the third-party organizations will submit those rotations to the administrators.
And actually this one piece, we actually, we talked to them, we&#39;re not going to be doing where students are able to submit a rotation requests in metrics using a form.
This is something that was discussed, but we&#39;re not going to be doing this. So let me put a Thing here.
So administrators will update the block schedule, um, and then students will see that on their calendars rotation, resources will be sent via email.
So we got to have them set up those rotation resources also, um, as part of the implementation, then for grade book, um, any evaluations, they are getting this information from third-party in PDF format as a zip file.
So what we&#39;re going to do is give them a way to, um, take those PDFs. And they&#39;re going to enter that information into the grade book, using our new rotation grades functionality.
So they&#39;ll open up a particular student&#39;s grade book and select a student enter any comments that are relevant, the grade, the rotation that they performed, and then submit that into the grade book, and then also be able to attach that PDF into metrics, using the, uh, um, functionality we added there.
And then we don&#39;t have any reports for the grade book, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s going to come up on how to track those grades.
Um, but we also need to be able to publish those grades to the students. Um, once they&#39;re in metrics Then, so this so far, what we&#39;re talking about is evaluations off the students by the preceptors, then for students evaluating the rotation, we&#39;re going to do all that in metrics.
So metrics we&#39;ll assign an evaluation to the student, and then we will get those evaluations to the students via email notifications that they complete this and administrators loyal to see the status and run reports.
So we had to load the templates for these student evaluations, case logs is currently being done through new innovations, and which is pretty, uh, uh, cumbersome having two different systems.
So they&#39;re gonna be moving over the case templates to metrics. And so as part of the implementation, we also need to do case logs, um, for a clerkship.
And then this includes all the moving, all the templates and the diagnosis and so on, um, and publishing that to the students.
The administration will define the cases and the requirements. Students will be able to submit that on a review of reports with the faculty.
So, one nice thing about this implementation is that we don&#39;t need to set site level permissions. It&#39;s all going to be managed in the program admin portal.
And so that&#39;s something to note, um, and that makes it easier for our setup. Okay. So onboarding documents and certifications are being handled via manual process.
Um, we can have a separate project, uh, where we can put all those requirements into metrics and then have them collect this information and send reminders and have it approved.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/43ccd96a55a7412f8843dc8d36c1f487</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>&lt;inaudible&gt; backsplash download now.

We can first organize this permission list a little bit, so we can have two sections, one for course, directors, and one for a session leaders, instead of having a bunch of different check boxes and under course directors, we can add an option that says, allow course directors to view profiles off a lot of cost structure to view the profiles of, um, uh, individuals scheduled to that course.
So if that&#39;s turned on, we can, uh, once has turned on then in their personal portal, they&#39;ll have a directory page, which we already have.
Um, so if you log in as a, Let&#39;s try a Perry Cox And I go to the user&#39;s page, sorry, personal portal.
And it&#39;s not shown here so best. Uh, I don&#39;t remember how we had set this up. So under, um, system set up permissions, Maria.
So Maria, if you log in as Maria on demo And go to directory, you&#39;ll see that this is what the core structure will see.
And on this page, if we give them the permission to see the profiles of the people that are scheduled to the course, they&#39;ll see a list of those individuals here, and then They can open up the thing, can click on it, to open up the profile and it will allow them to see, um, their profile without being able to edit it.
Okay. And their profile will also show those, that new evaluations tab that we were talking about. And one more thing that we can mention in there is that when the permission is being set, So under curriculum system set up permissions director.
So we&#39;re going to add it permission that says a lot of course, directors to view profiles of the individuals that are scheduled to this course.
And we can also give them a timeframe because you&#39;re going to have multiple semesters happening over a period of time.
And if you keep, if you let them see the students for every single semester they ever had, then that&#39;ll be a lot of students.
Um, we&#39;ll need to figure out a way to limit that access or hide it. Um, Why don&#39;t we start with just showing everybody.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/752470930ab44081ba1c937aeee2eb0a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this permission should change. It should go in a separate task and it&#39;ll be, it&#39;ll follow the other one.
Uh, we can assign both of them at the same time, but it&#39;s going to be somewhat linked. Um, so under curriculum system set up curriculum permissions under director slash leader permissions.
Um, we can actually clean this up a little to have two sections, one, for course, director permissions, another for session leader permission.
So that&#39;s easier to manage. And then we&#39;re going to add a new course director permission that says a allow course directors do view profiles of the people scheduled to the course.
And if that&#39;s turned on, then the user that administrator or that course director will see the profiles of the individuals that are scheduled to it.
So if I go to users and when I log in as three out, I&#39;m going to pretend like she&#39;s a course director.
And that scenario, if I go to the directory page, in addition to seeing myself, I&#39;ll see all of the students, uh, or any other users that are scheduled to that course, that I&#39;m a director off.
So under curriculum courses, I&#39;m going to make Maria and director of one of the courses. They&#39;re gonna add groups to that course.
So remember on the courses page on curriculum, you can link a bunch of groups to it, and that&#39;s how you scheduled it into that course.
And once they are scheduled, if, since Maria is the director of that course, all those users will be accessible by Maria.
And right now I can expanding at a demographic while we&#39;re going to do is if she can access those students, she&#39;ll be able to click view, profile and open up that student&#39;s profile and see what&#39;s in there, including the new evaluations tab that you&#39;re working on and the other task.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a78729a80a7f47b1a196c828de142fa4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CSM Team Performance Metrics That Matter – CSM Practice - 2 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Again again. So I wanted to make this video to spend a little bit more time on the things we were talking about on Friday.
Um, I was pretty rushed on Friday and wasn&#39;t, uh, um, going in through everything because I had temple in the afternoon and I feel like I didn&#39;t spend enough time on some of these things.
And I also want to start off explaining why I got frustrated on Friday after our discussion about ostomy. Um, I want to, you know, I didn&#39;t mean to come off in a way that it was blaming you for, um, us not having that done.
Cause that&#39;s, I understand that you&#39;re putting in a lot of work towards that. The reason I got frustrated was because of the, um, miscommunication associated with that when we had in last week, the week before we had, uh, you had, you had brought up that you&#39;re going to get it done by Wednesday.
And then we had met, um, when, uh, you and I had met about, um, getting help for Maria to finish those curriculum and also, um, you know, giving some general feedback on her behavior.
Um, and you know, I wanted to address that with her and I gave her those three articles, um, guides to ripe.
And I also gave her the general feedback, uh, coming from me, not from you. Um, and I was hoping that that would take care of what you needed to get it done by Wednesday.
Cause you said that was the only thing that was he needed help with. And then when I saw that on Wednesday, you had said you require, it requires you to work 12 hours a day until January 7th.
Um, I, I was like, what, why does it require this much time, 12 hours a day for a week when the only thing that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e661bedbc27f4c5fb4da403cfbd5a47c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So we had some, uh, smaller issues that came up during it, call for curriculum. So, first Thing that we need to write up is on the courses page.
For some reason, the table got screwed up and you had to scroll all the way to the right to be able to see, use it.
Then on the sessions page, we have the ability to upload, um, let&#39;s say you&#39;re uploading session objectives, or any of these objectives.
We have a field called an order. The order field allows us to define what order they should appear on the screen.
So if I choose one, um, of these objectives, so let&#39;s say cataract, and come down here, you have these three here, but when you&#39;re editing on the screen, we don&#39;t show the order.
And what happens is when you&#39;re uploading as a CSV, you do have the ability to set an order, but then you don&#39;t have a way to change it here.
Or when you&#39;re uploading it with a CSV, you do not put an order. And the system has that field is blank.
And what happens is whenever they make an edit, they are, uh, the system would add an order and then it screws up the order.
So our solution is going to be for us to, um, whenever we were editing an objective or when you&#39;re editing a category, the category issue has the order.
Just the objectives. We want to add a field here called order, just like what we have for you. Um, the section that are category, and then on this column, um, next in front of code, add the, um, order field so that we can see the order and same thing.
Also, for course, level objectives. Let&#39;s just make sure yes, this one actually has the order, but we just need to show it here in front of, and then program level objectives.
We have the order and we can show it here in front of it. And then also for, or global objectives, we have the order.
We just want to put an order in front of it. Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e228ba5c9cad4f7f8ab8458aa7ec27fb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Leadership OKRs</pre></td><td><pre>So for my OKR S I started with, uh, the Cypress tests. And so far we had the meeting with the developers and, uh, the training is going on.
And also we have a server set up for Cypress, uh, database creation. Um, that&#39;s, uh, where we are so far on that.
So I put a 5% because we haven&#39;t started creating the, um, specs yet, uh, redesign and write specs for a clinical scheduling module.
Mike and I work a little bit on it. And, uh, so I put 10% on that. Haven&#39;t done anything significant for, um, a report stood it, viewer pulse, man.
Um, however, the company portal, there is a document that was created that outlines all of the different changes that need to be made.
Um, I need to turn those development tasks. Then we started yet. Hold on. All right. So implement product board. So it&#39;s 30% on it set up and Mike&#39;s been added to that.
And I think others have a view access and, um, the labels have been set up and, um, Intercom and everybody can start using the labels anytime where something is labeled or tagged in Intercom, it gets pulled into product bore for us to turn into development tasks.
This one I have not started. This one have not started this, something that I&#39;m going to be looking at the today, RFP, this, uh, um, it&#39;s 10%.
So we still need to make a lot of progress on this. Um, well, I need to make a lot of progress on that donkey and process instructions.
So this is, I haven&#39;t started yet. Tetra has been set up and a couple of people have access to it, but we need to, uh, figure out a structure and move over some data.
Having started this one, having started this one, and haven&#39;t started this one yet.

If your cases for Perry Cox to approve</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ea861a96d55f42cf9d14b75ea59a041d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 27 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Here, we&#39;ll take a look at metrics, uh, curriculum search and reporting functionality. So the first thing to, uh, talk about is metrics.
A curriculum search itself is a report and you can search different, uh, objectives, keywords content, and then export that information from the system.
Also, the reports that are built into metrics are a starting point for most organization. If you want to go beyond that and you want to do more advanced reporting metrics does offer the ability for the system to be hooked up to a business intelligence software like Tableau or power BI for more advanced reporting.
So starting with the curriculum search the objective tab, the first thing you can see here is that we can select the academic period.
So anytime a person is using metrics curriculum, you can always go back to the past and see what the curriculum contained in the previous academic periods.
The switch program option is not going to be applicable to for most programs because there you will only have one school of medicine, school of nursing.
Um, but if you have multiple training programs using the curriculum module, you&#39;ll be able to toggle into them. If you&#39;re a super administrator, then we have a way to search the curriculum course in rotation objectives or session objectives.
And then we can select whether it&#39;s mapped or unmapped, and here we can type in a key word. And it allows us to look at a specific, a phrase or word, and it searches the entire set of course objectives for that key word.
And we can also select a, um, if I&#39;m selecting a course, uh, objective to search, I can say, show me all the course objectives that are mapped to this program objectives.
Or if I go to the session objectives, I can say, show me all the, the, uh, session objectives that are mapped to the course objectives.
Then it&#39;ll allows, allows me to see that here. Sorry. I need to correct that. Uh, when I&#39;m, if I go to session a session and I select map to I&#39;m able to select any of the session objectives in the system, and then it will show me all right now,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/87c8aaecd52f40cfac43eb9923216be1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum Search + All Curriculum Reports + Timeline View + Tree View</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the curriculum search and curriculum reporting functionality, and starting with curriculum search.
We have three tabs here, and the first is the objective tab where I can select a specific academic period. And it&#39;s important to highlight that a faculty or student Dean, they can always go back in time and see what was in the prior academic academic periods curriculum.
Any time I can go back and search the previous academic periods, uh, if they need to. So for the objective tab, we have the objective search where I can choose to search course in rotation objectives with the status of mapped or unmapped.
And that can either search by a phrase word or a text, or I can select, um, any program objectives that the, that is mapped to this.
So remember, the hierarchy of the curriculum is you have global objectives, course objectives. Then you have session objective, sorry, global objectives, program objectives, course objectives and session objectives.
So if I, if I&#39;m saying, I want to find course objectives mapped to it&#39;s telling me to select any program objectives that, um, that are mapped to this.
So show me all the program objectives that are mapped. Sorry, let me say that one more time. Show me all the course objectives that are mapped to E one dash two, which is a program objective.
And if I click search, it will show me that. So I click expand. You can see , it&#39;s a map to this course objective, which is mapped to this session.
Objective. I can do the same thing on the session level. In this case, I want to show all session objective that are mapped to this course objective.
So because course objective is one level higher than session. So it was telling me, um, this particular session objective is mapped to P C3.
So you can see here how it&#39;s mapped back. Or if I had selected some key word or some phrase to search, I can do that.
And it gave me the results for that specific keyword. I put, I didn&#39;t put anything in there. I actually searched the entire curriculum and gave me the results I can expand and show the real and see the relationship can click on top of one of these to see the full text for it.
Click on view details. It gives me all the session details above. If I had searched for courses course objectives. This would have shown me the course details here and click download and me to download this to a PDF Or to, or to a spreadsheet.
Same thing here. If I searched, for course objectives, you can see this given me this course details and I can download it to PDF or spreadsheet.
Um, if I need to share with anybody outside of metrics, now let&#39;s go to the keywords tab. So under keywords, if I search for a keyword, I can add one a more.
He works here and it gives me the results and the highlights, the keywords that I searched for. Plus any other keywords that are part of this session, click on the course name, to see the details of that course, click on the session name, to see the details of that session.
And then I can always export this information to a PDF. That&#39;s what it looks like. Then we have the content search.
So this gives me all the documents that are attached to sessions so I can filter them by core session, method types.
And then when I scroll down by default, it shows me everything. But if I want to filter by PDFs, I can do that by word documents, spreadsheets links are point texts, photos.
Um, and then from here, I can download those directly from this page by uncheck all of them. It also shows me any sessions that do not have any attachments and anywhere we see a search bar, we can also type in here to search in real time and filter the results.
Now let&#39;s take a look at the reports under the curriculum section. We have a few different reports that you can use.
The first is the map keywords, sorry, the keywords report. And for this, I can select an academic period. Let&#39;s select a few of them and then generate the report.
If it&#39;s a big report, I may want to use the email report to me when it&#39;s done functionality, this will send you a PDF, sorry, send you an Excel file.
And an email after the report has been generated. So let&#39;s download this and see what it looks like. So this is what it looks like.
Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t have any data. Let&#39;s go back in time and see if we can find one that does have some data clear this, There we go.
So what this report is showing is the academic levels course code, uh, course name, session, code, session, name, session, session, type of session name, and then the keywords that are associated with that.
So if a particular, um, session has more than one key word, then it shows up in separate roles here. So that&#39;s the key word for report.
Let&#39;s go back to curriculum map, relationship report. And this report is meant to show relationship between two levels of the hierarchy.
So I can say, show me the relationship between global objectives and session objectives. So in this case, I want to see how the relationship, how the sessions have a mapped to the, uh, global objectives.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/11e34e5939a34f369507238cb7ecdd00</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Cloud Recording - Santhosh Cherian&#39;s Zoom Meeting is now available - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 29 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So Mike, so for the first task, what we need to do is when you look at a profile for a trainee, we need to add a tab to quality valuations.
And when we go to that tab is going to show all the evaluations for this trainee has to do. And the ones that has been completed on them, as well as what they need to complete.
So we&#39;re going to model that after the evaluations page and their personal portal. So you can see on the personal portal, we have, um, the, for me and about me tabs and what we want to do is take that Timmy call back and, um, log in.
It&#39;s very Cox so that we can see it. So if I go to personal evaluations here, I can see all the, for me and about me tab.
So we want to do something like this there on their profile, where I have a, for me tab and about me.
And, um, and it, and in there we will see, it will show all the ones they have to complete. That needs to be, that has been completed on them is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work exactly should work exactly the same, because this is meant to be for an individual to look at their own data.
And the other scenario we&#39;re looking at, um, what, um, uh, trainee has completed has not completed. So I think I feel like one, uh, a slightly different approach where we&#39;ll have a, for me, and instead of having an incomplete and complete a filter here, we can just list everything out and then show the status as completed or incomplete.
Um, and if, if, if you click view right now, it goes to a separate page instead of, um, going to a separate page, we need to open it up on a model, just like we do on the assignments page.
So if I go to the evaluations assignments page and I click view, it&#39;ll bring up in a model. So that&#39;s what we need to do.
So to let&#39;s review again at, I feel like a may have been a little bit of a mess, what I just went over.
So let&#39;s review from the beginning. So I&#39;m gonna open up any trainees profile and on the profile page, um, we&#39;re going to add a new tab, quality evaluations, and on tab, we&#39;ll probably have a couple of tabs that says for John and about John and with the search bar, but we don&#39;t want to filter to any filters like this, or I guess, I don&#39;t know.
You can think about it. If it filters is a good idea, we can keep it, but it&#39;ll show all of the things that they have to complete for me to complete.
And then about John will show all the ones that were completed on this person and anything, also anything that was incomplete.
So it is going to show all evaluations, um, for John on the form, uh, for John tab and all evaluations about John on the about John tab and even the ones that are incomplete.
And in this page, when you click view, it opens up into a separate page. But what we want to do is instead open up in a model like this, where we can open and close it.
And we also want to keep the, uh, um, somewhat unable to assess PDF and delete buttons, um, on there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0427d3d7c1cc449abccf60b0e6dcae15</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So in this case, I am trying to create an event, click into it groups invite and going to invite, uh, let&#39;s say a test group too, create don&#39;t.
Remember who was in test group two. Let&#39;s go find out. So yeah, we have let&#39;s log in as Rebecca Adler and see if this is on our calendar.
Okay. Let&#39;s try somebody else. Since this person&#39;s inactive. I like a calendar and you&#39;ll see that event is not here anywhere quite a month for you.
It&#39;s not here, but if I go to the institutional portal and choose internal medicine groups invite, it does show up.
So for some reason, if you invite someone as using groups, it does not show up on their personal calendar, but if you invite them by role, it does.
So we need to fix that and make sure that it works with groups also.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8f8bc3620dcd4c8aaf51ffae94fc2d6a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, here&#39;s another quick thing that we need to write up for. Um, uh Talem and this is under case logs.
We currently have the ability to require approval or not. And the issue they&#39;re facing is that they don&#39;t use approval and the students are able to submit this fine.
But what happens is if you don&#39;t re don&#39;t require approval, um, as soon as, as soon as it&#39;s submitted, it gets marked as approved.
And if it&#39;s marked as approved, they don&#39;t have a way to edit it anymore. So what we need to do is, uh, update this a little bit so that if no approval is needed, um, we can, instead of saying the word approved, we can say, um, uh, we can, we can say, um, uh, actually I don&#39;t know what, uh, status we can, um, we can just say, um, submitted and all right.
I I&#39;m, I&#39;m brainstorming here. Sorry about that. Um, but maybe we can, let&#39;s just forget about the status change. We&#39;ll leave it as approved, but if it, if no approvals needed, the main thing that they need is an edit button so that they can make changes since there is no approval, it&#39;s okay for them to change it whenever they want to update it.
So we want to make sure that if the template says no approval needed, then we will show the edit button, um, next to it.
And we can, um, yeah, we can show the, uh, the view. Um, we can show the view button for all of it because there&#39;s no reason why they shouldn&#39;t be able to view it just because it&#39;s pending.
So it&#39;d be view, edit and delete. The only place that we will not allow, um, editing is if it&#39;s approval needed and it was approved by a supervisor, otherwise they should be able to view, edit and delete any of the logs.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/096e9218dfd9482f9a44edb1884db212</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Maria. So for the curriculum module, when it comes to the, uh, setup, um, I like, I usually like to start off with starting with the foundation and explaining how the set up is done.
Um, starting with this curriculum setup page where they&#39;re able to create different academic levels and typically these academic levels, they&#39;re going to create four of them and they should match the different roles that are used for the students Ms.
1, 2, 3, 4, and then you can add some basic information about the institution. That was my dog. If you heard that he&#39;s snoring.
Um, the second part of the setup is giving permissions to individuals that need to have access to the system. This includes adding, um, full curriculum permissions.
So if you add full curriculum permissions and they&#39;ll be able to access everything in the Creek, in the, uh, system, um, related to curriculum, except for the setup page, the setup page can only be accessed if they have program avenue rights.
And addition to that, we have curriculum leaders, sorry, the, uh, course directors in session leaders. So of course directors are added onto the course itself.
So if I click edit on a course, I can specify directors. The name directors is actually a little misleading. It&#39;s basically we are adding anybody that would have administrative privileges to the course.
So it could be a coordinator that it needs to edit stuff. Um, so you&#39;re able to specify them and they&#39;ll have edit permissions for the entire course.
And then under sessions, there are leaders that are added. So when I create a new session, so I can find one that already has one, I can, um, create the session and then attach a schedule to it.
And as part of that schedule, I can specify that the, um, somebody who&#39;s a leader and in order to have somebody available to be selected as a leader, you first have to schedule them to the course.
So on, on the course and rotation page, there is a way to add groups. And once you add groups to this, uh, course, then those individuals will be available to be selected as a leader or as an invite T for the, for the session.
So anyway, so we have course directors, session leaders, and here, here is where you would give them permissions. And these permissions is good to explain in an article.
Um, maybe you can have an article about permissions and you can, we can explain how, if you&#39;re a course director, um, then you&#39;re able to, uh, give them access to edit anything in the course, if you&#39;re, um, or you can also have them ability to create, um, custom keywords.
So even if you give them ability to edit the full course, you can still prevent them from creating keywords because the curriculum Dean may want to control the, the, what keywords are available in the system.
And then there&#39;s also a way to, um, add a remote keyword from sessions. That&#39;s more granular control that you have over the course directors.
Then the same thing with session leaders, where you had the ability to make edits to their sessions. You can have the ability to add a remote keywords from sessions, and then also create custom keywords, the sessions.
Then there&#39;s also session types. And these are usually set up as part of the initial onboarding. And we create the different session types.
They have lectures, labs, small groups. And so on key words, they have the ability to import the set up keywords into the system.
And these keywords can be imported using a template that we provide. So the upload CSV has a template they can download and then populate and reapply it back into the system.
I&#39;m going to skip group roles. So then the sessions themselves have instructional methods and assessment methods. We can explain that this is part of the AMCs instructional methods, assessment methods and so on.
And these are editable. You want to make changes, or they can remove any of the ones that are not going to be using.
They can also create custom themes for their sessions. So they want to group a bunch of sessions together in or under a theme.
They can create those teams here and migrate curriculum. I wouldn&#39;t go into the setup part of the, part of the article.
This will be a whole new article that we&#39;re going to create later, where he can use it to explain how curriculum can be moved from one academic year to the other.
Essentially we just copied over from one year to the next, uh, we&#39;ll ignore that. So that&#39;s the basic setup and that can be an article on, of its own.
And then once we have that a way to group, um, are we going to have an introductory article to curriculum as a whole, where we explain how the curriculum is broken down into, um, essentially three major components, you have the objectives, you have the content.
So content usually we&#39;ll go into like the sessions. So you have the, uh, you know, the schedule is key, sorry, the keywords and any sort of instructional assessment methods of resources.
This is what I would consider the content section. And the third part of a curriculum as a whole is the schedules.
So there&#39;s two types of schedules. There&#39;s the course level scheduling and then there&#39;s session level scheduling. So that&#39;s the, the foundation of, uh, the curriculum as a whole.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6dc5b3e68cb64ad3bf582f5f1ad786b8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So we have a couple of issues here that we need you to write up. The first thing is, um, on the curriculum page, we have, uh, courses in rotation and you can see the table somehow gotten broken and it does scroll all the way to the right to be able to see it.
So that&#39;s one issue and we may be able to batch some of these together since they&#39;re pretty small issues. So that&#39;s one, another thing that came up during a call is you pick a, um, session objective here, choose one.
And I have a few of these and if I go in here and I edit something, just add a letter to it and save, um, Okay.
Of course now it&#39;s not happening. Okay. &lt;inaudible&gt;.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/89901a5843f6400392eb9bde5b16f16a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Term Sheet.docx - Google Docs - 10 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So for this one, they&#39;re asking for implementation and training credits within means from my understanding is they&#39;re looking for how much time we&#39;re committing to helping them implement the platform, saying X number hours or something like that.
And we need to have a better explanation here saying our implementation process is outlined above, and this will include a series of project to implement different parts of the system.
Each project may, um, will last a few weeks and, uh, we&#39;ll include a series of meetings that are happening weekly or biweekly that will include training and, um, helping the organization clean up and migrate the data into the platform.
So we don&#39;t have a cap on the number of hours that were available for implementation, but during that period, we will have a, um, specific timeline created for each project.
And, uh, the expectation will be that the university also delegated the appropriate TA uh, TA team members to make sure we meet those deadlines.
And from our time we will put the time necessary to make sure that institution is getting the value that they need.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3c8971d3cf63470f98445cf76d6cc8bd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum Framework</pre></td><td><pre>All right. Starting at the global objectives. What we want to highlight is, uh, first present the hierarchy of global objectives, program objectives, course objectives, and then session objectives and how they&#39;re all connected together.
And typically for the global objectives, we define the American association of medical colleges, a AMC&#39;s PCRs physician competency reference set as a default, but for international schools, we can also do other competence or other global standards such as the can meds.
Um, and the idea here is that we would import the global objectives to the system, and it would be linked to a particular academic period.
And, uh, this can be important using a spreadsheet that we would do during implementation. Once it&#39;s in the system, it can be edited.
So you can see here that we have the category of that objective with the code, that, um, the name of the category of patient care and description.
And within that category, we have the specific objectives that, um, go with that. So we have the code for that objective.
Plus the description of that, and the order field allows us to define how there&#39;ll be displayed on the page, and we can move things up and down by updating that here on the number.
Um, if you want me to, if I need to edit anything, I can edit this directly in the system and you can see here, there are multiple categories of objectives and the system.
So this is a flexible way to define the global objectives. And then the next level down is our program objectives.
These are meant to be the medical school nursing school or any other professional schools, internal objectives for that training program.
So in this case, this is a school of medicine and we&#39;re defining the objectives for that particular school. And then once these objectives are in the system, um, we can, um, edit them in the system using this, uh, options here, and we can also, um, map them.
So if I go to the mappings tab on the left side, we have the global objectives, the right side, we have the program objectives and I can click here and search for things by just, I think, organize and real-time search the entire page.
And then on the right side, we have all of the objectives that are part of this program. And on the left side, we can actually take this and drag it off to the right side and do the mapping from one side to the next.
So if something is as nothing mapped to it, it&#39;ll be red. And if something has been mapped to it, it&#39;ll turn green.
One thing that I would do before I use any screenshots from here is just try and Google this to make sure this does not belong to an actual medical school and that we&#39;re not plagiarizing and everything can be imported from a CSV file.
We would actually provide the template here. You can download the template and upload it directly from metric and directly from that spreadsheet.
And the only thing they have to do is make sure that the data is formatted into the appropriate columns next level down, have the courses and rotations.
And we, again add this to that each academic period, this could be a year or semester. And when we are creating a new rotation, we can define whether it&#39;s sorry, when you&#39;re creating a new course or rotation.
First thing you would do is define whether it was a course or rotation, whether it&#39;s mandatory or elective, and each course should have a name and a code.
That code is something that you might want to check with the registrar on what they&#39;re using. And then directors. These are individuals who will have, who can be given permissions to edit the content of this course, the start date and end date for this particular course, which academic level of belongs to the credits and then any additional descriptors that you want to have here.
If you&#39;re using metrics for scheduling, you&#39;re also able to link the roster of groups, the student groups, to this particular course.
And there&#39;s also a search option here, just type in source entire page. Then if we go to the course objectives, I can select the course and create objectives in metrics, um, or I can go ahead and import them using the upload CSV page.
So I select the foundations of medicine course here. I can see all the course objectives for this particular course and of the mappings tab.
I&#39;m able to select on the left side, the course, and then click into it. It&#39;s not a drag and drop interface here.
You can actually simply go in here and select the necessary mappings to the program objectives. So of course in rotation objectives are going to be mapped to the program.
Objectives. Program objectives are going to be mapped to the global objectives next. Um, actually I can, we, we want to import any of this, including the course rotation, it lists the objectives and the mappings we provide templates to do that last level of the hierarchy is going to be the sessions.
And here I can select a particular course. And when I open up the course, it&#39;ll show me all the sessions that are in the system for that particular course.
And if I need to add a new session, I click add session, create a code. Again, this code should be unique for a particular session for objectives and for session codes, course codes, they all should be unique.
And it&#39;s good to name the code in a, in a format that allows you to recognize what it is. So for example, if this is for anatomy on 1 0 1 dot LEC, oh one, this may tell me, this is the first lecture of anatomy 1 0 1, and then give it a title duration theme.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/75ee4c89ceae4f5cb898b91617d6e9be</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) | Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So it would be helpful for you to study this lottery module a little bit because it, we built this a long time ago, and I&#39;m going to go through a few documents that you can review and try to just organize it for you.
And then you can look through it and Chris can give you the URL to access the lottery. And what we need to do is figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t.
And, and from there, we need to create some tasks for us to finish that module, or at least get it to where it was before.
So the way that it was supposed to work is on the administration portal, there was a lottery section, and there you could create a new lottery, which allows you to define a start date and end date and the start date and end date as the opening day, when the students are allowed to start submitting preferences, and then closing date is when they, they can no longer enter preferences.
And then the run date is when the actual algorithm runs and in the lottery, you can pick a bunch of rotations and also say which roles are allowed to participate in the lottery.
And then from there, once it&#39;s created, it allows you to define blocks. So for a lottery, you can say, the first block goes from July one to July 28th.
It will allow 50 trainees and you can add 50 trainees as Ms. Three or Ms four. Um, and then this means that we see only, um, I&#39;m sorry.
Um, you, you, you select a rotation, let&#39;s say cardiology, and then you could, um, say for cardiology, we&#39;re going to run this cardiology rotation three times during the year.
It will be July one to July 28th, July 29th to, uh, August 30th and then on September 1st to September 29th.
So those are the three blocks for cardiology. And then for each of those blocks, you&#39;ll be able to define how many, um, um, uh, third year students, you are allowed to have how many fourth year students you&#39;re allowed to have and so on.
And then once that is scheduled, once that is set up, you have the framework for the lottery. So it&#39;s the start date end date, which rotations to include which roles to include.
And then for each rotation you want to fill with students, you would create, um, what blocks you have running throughout the year.
And for each of those blocks, you&#39;re able to say, um, it allows X number of &lt;inaudible&gt; X number Ms. Force. Think of it again, like a college class where you have the, uh, the computer science on a one class happening, uh, uh, your rotation will be like computer science, 1 0 1, it&#39;s open to third and fourth year students.
And it may run, um, once in the spring semester and once in the fall semester. So the block, uh, one of the blocks would be the spring semester, another block of the fall semester.
And you&#39;re going to say that you&#39;re allowing 50 of third year students in the spring semester and, uh, 44th year students.
And in the, uh, the other semester, are you going to allow X number of, um, 30 students, X number 43 students.
So that will then start the lottery process. And if you open up the lottery, it&#39;ll tell you that cardiology&#39;s here.
This is block 1, 2, 3, 4, and then how many students are allowed for each of these. Um, and then, um, it also allows you to pre-fill, uh, people into these.
So let&#39;s say before other students able to submit their preferences, uh, you can go ahead and add people into the lottery.
So it could be two students, uh, for Emissary you want to put in there cause you liked them. Um, or two students that RMS for, and then those slots would already be taken up and, and, uh, will not be a lot available for the other students to choose from.
So that&#39;s the preference. And then from the student&#39;s side, what they could do is they will see the lottery on their system.
Along with the time they have to submit their preferences. And when they, um, actually this is not the latest, uh, design here.
I think there&#39;s a video that Chris recorded, um, that she&#39;ll goes into how they would add these, uh, at these, uh, uh, preferences.
So let me see if I can pop that open so you can see, I can open this up and then I can rank my preferences in order.
So if I click new preference at the top, I&#39;ll be able to select a site and select a rotation and see how many available slots are and add those to my rank list.
And then I can move those around to reorder them. And then finally, when the lottery assignment time comes, the residents or the, sorry, the administrators will be able to view what the system matched into each of, Um, rotations.
And then they can manually edit things in here and make changes and add a remote students. And once they finalize it, they can move that schedule over to a block schedule, which we have in our system, and then have that block schedule be published for everybody in the schools to see.
So that&#39;s how it&#39;s meant to work. Um, and I&#39;ll send you all of this and then you can take a look.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/355444bfb5d74ad5bd53a64a1869908d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 21 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>This is a very old school feature that we built a years ago.

If you go to demo and Log in as Perry Cox I&#39;m as I&#39;m as admin right now. But if we go under here, schedules, shift, change requests, these uh, can be turned on.
And once it&#39;s turned on, I would put someone on a shift schedule and then go into that user&#39;s account. Oh, two schedules, sorry, calendar.
So let&#39;s see for this person has a shift schedule that we can look at. There&#39;s one click on it. And here on email to one work, this shift, click on, you can submit this for approval requests, shift, change, and Indicate another shift.
And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not sure why this dropdown is not working. It could be a bug. It could be that there&#39;s no other shift where this person can switch.
This is a PGY two resident, and they now be able to switch to another one. Um, but either way, I&#39;m going to leave this as this.
You can try this out with John Dorian. Um, and then once you submit this for approval, it&#39;s supposed to come to the admin portal on the right side, under the alerts section where you can review and approve it again.

So when I&#39;m going here to remove somebody and updating it, it looks like I&#39;m just to move a few of these.
So that worked well. And if I click in here and add somebody, so it says it&#39;s updated, but it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s adding anybody.
So removing works fine adding, uh, someone doesn&#39;t seem to work well. And then if I change to faculty, doesn&#39;t seem to be changing the, uh, the user type here.
Um, so user type changing doesn&#39;t work and then adding programs doesn&#39;t work. And the other thing that I, I was hoping we can also add here is a column that&#39;s so-called portal and it&#39;ll show the user type there</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cd5865041cf046b9bcb7482fc733a2fd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Curriculum Initial Setup</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the initial setup of a curriculum and we&#39;ll go through these items.
So under curriculum module in system set up, sorry, curriculum set up. We have several tabs here. So the first thing that institution needs to do is define their academic levels.
So in metrics we have these roles  and what we&#39;re doing is adding a label to those. This can be customized as needed for the curriculum.
Typically we just keep it the same as the roles, but we&#39;re defining what the four levels of training are and these other areas we&#39;ll skip for now.
And then the next thing we want to set up are the session settings. So we can skip the mapping hierarchy, uh, because that is a more advanced thing.
And we don&#39;t really didn&#39;t get to get into so methods and themes do that. So a metrics includes a list of the AMCs and LCMS method types, preloaded.
So we have instructional methods, assessment methods, resources, all preloaded into the system. If you&#39;re not going to be using all of these items on here, it&#39;s possible to simply delete them.
Or if we want to add new ones or edit any of these, go ahead and edit them and rename them as you like.
So each, each school can define them, um, to their own custom needs. But if you&#39;re, if the school is going to be submitting, this information to AMC is best to lead the code types as they are assessment methods, same thing here, we have all of them preloaded.
And if you need to bulk import these method types, we actually have a template that you can download and use it to upload a new assessment types resources here.
So when we explain this in stone, we can sort of explain that it&#39;s all preloaded and keep it simple. They can come here, edit and rename it.
Most schools will just use what we have. It is good to spend a little bit of time explaining that we do have a way for them to create themes.
So themes are meant to be something that they define as a school and how to group the different sessions together.
So they add a bunch of themes in here. It can be added one by one or uploaded using a template.
And then once the themes are defined, if I go to a particular, um, course, there was a three times dropdown and whenever a session is being created, they can say that this session is teaching a one or more themes.
So it&#39;s a good way to group the teams together. So in metrics we have, um, key words and themes are the two things that can be used to, um, map or group sessions from different courses under the same umbrella.
So if you have the same theme being used in five different courses, this is a way to say that, um, all of these, all of these are sessions that are part of those five courses, uh, teaching similar, uh, similar topics.
Then we have the session event types who will, so they, these are more, um, global event types and not, um, these method types are supposed to be more granular saying what exactly what they&#39;re doing, but these event types are meant to be lecture labs, small groups, large groups, simulation.
These, uh, event types are something that they define for the entire school and different faculty will use those to categorize them when they create a session and in the stone, the article, we can provide a list of those sample ones also.
So another thing that we need to define at the beginning is a list of all the graded courses and rotations.
So in the curriculum, we&#39;ll have different lectures and labs that are, um, being created. And what we want to do is, um, first add them first, add them to the, the, um, okay, then it doesn&#39;t look like this was, uh, implemented correctly.
Uh, I&#39;m gonna, we&#39;ll skip this for now. This is a new release that we need to make some tweaks here.
So, um, let&#39;s just do, so we did all of these. We&#39;re going to do permissions next. So prefer permissions by default.
If you&#39;re a program admin you&#39;ll have full edit permissions to the Cal, uh, curriculum, you can do anything. You can add whatever you want, you can remove whatever you want.
And if you are not a program admin, we have a way to give full permission to the curriculum module. This means that you can do anything in here except for the setup page.
So if I give, um, then this can be done as view or edit. So if I, Alison here can view everything in here except for the setup page, from her personal portal.
So if I log in as Alison, she won&#39;t be able to view the institutional and program admin pages, but she can go into the personal PA edge that she&#39;s in, go to the curriculum and see everything, except for the setup.
If I give her edit permissions, then she&#39;ll also be able to edit anything in here, including the mappings and courses, but she won&#39;t be able to, um, um, go to the setup page and add change any settings.
Then we have the director and leader, uh, permissions. So it&#39;s good to list out each of these in the article and explain what that means.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/798e030d83bb4a5093a36ff34325ab75</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>5 Books I Have Recommended Over 100 Times | by Shreya Badonia | Oct, 2021 | Books Are Our Superpower</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys. So for our blog wanted us to make some changes so that we emphasize the story more where we go here and like this, the, the, this block kind of appearance it&#39;s, um, okay.
On this page. Um, but once we get to this page, especially if you have a low resolution screen, it&#39;s not that the page is like, uh, when you look at a page, uh, the person should be able to use that page without having to scroll it for a good usability.
And right now we&#39;re coming to a page and we&#39;re showing the same information on the, on the screen that they already saw on the previous screen.
They&#39;re not really getting into the actual meat of the content. So what we want to do is, um, borrow something from medium where, so if I go to a medium article, Um, and I also feel like, uh, if we want to lay this out differently, because this block structure where you had to go Corazon totally, and then scroll down and go to the horizontally, it doesn&#39;t really flow well when you&#39;re trying to review content, because most people want to go up top to bottom and scan for anything.
That&#39;s interesting. So it makes it harder for them to use. I feel like medium does a really good job. It&#39;s a blog and we can borrow from their design where we have, um, different topics where the story and the heading is the highlight and the images smaller.
And then if we are adding tags, they can see the tags on the right side. And if I click on, um, one of these, it&#39;ll open it up.
And then if there is an image, it can show up at the top, but I&#39;m, I feel like, yeah, the image at the top is like a, is something that I&#39;m not a big fan of because they already saw the image.
I&#39;m more interested in us taking them directly to the page where the actual content is, is a highlighted and a font hierarchy.
Is, is it enough for them to actually like read it to the heading is large enough and the text sizes, easy to read.
Um, we can basically copy exactly what they&#39;re doing here with the blog. Um, cause it really works really well. So here I open this up, um, instead of having this at the top, we would, should be able to see the title and then come down and start reading it.
And this header image, if we&#39;re using a header image, maybe we can have it as a less, um, prominent thing that shows up, uh, at the top under, um, I&#39;m just, uh, I&#39;m still.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/daa9b838a61f4d25951046fa0d29b979</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So I&#39;m testing out this feature and I was able to get the groups to work and it shows up on the portal.

So it&#39;s just adding people to the group. Not all it doesn&#39;t work, it looks like it&#39;s working, but when I refresh the page, it comes back.

We wanted to create a video that explains how it works.
So the, the documents module is used for creating documents from templates. So the first thing that the user do, the administrator does is go in here and creates a bunch of merge fields.
And these merge fields are then used on rotation templates, sorry, document templates. So for example, if I edit one of these templates and I go to merge fields, you can see that these fields that are inserted into the document, and when this document is generated by an administrator, these fields get filled in with the appropriate information.
So if I go to the administrator portal, Go to manage documents, sorry, templates, page, and select a document And fill in these fields.
You can see here, I can select mation, save a document, and you can see that this information got filled in from what I typed.

So for this task, I had a conversation with real about the drawer and the drawer thing is the sites.
When we open up a site, what it looks like. So I do feel that this is a good time for us to change this into a draw format, because when someone&#39;s working on a laptop or something, when you expand this ends up being a very long page, we have a lot of data added, and then you had to go back up to the top and collapse it.
So it&#39;s kind of annoying to work with, but if it&#39;s a drawer, it opens up on the right side, then they can work with it easily.
Sorta what I&#39;m thinking is on the drawer, when it comes up, it could show this, this rotate, I mean, uh, the course information at the top, and then below that we can have, um, um, all of the, um, um, we can have the, uh, uh, uh, separate tabs for, uh, uh, for that particular session.
So the first tab could be session details, which can have a little section for schedule keywords. And then instead of content, we can call it, uh, um, methods.
And then those three would be in the first tab. And we&#39;ll have a second tab called objectives where we&#39;re creating objectives in there.
And the third tab, we don&#39;t have it created yet. We&#39;re going to have another content tab called another time called content.
So those are going to be, um, in the, in the future, we&#39;re going to add a functionality where they can upload a bunch of files in there.
So essentially I would click, click hit this show button brings up a drawer similar to the way that when you click on sites, it opens up a drawer.
And at the top, it&#39;ll have this details about the course itself. And we can probably add more details than what&#39;s up here since the course have additional information such as the course, uh, uh, from the courses page, you can take what&#39;s in there.
And then when it comes up, it&#39;ll have three tabs first for session details, uh, which will have these three things.
Then it&#39;ll have an objectives tab and then I&#39;ll have a content tab. So going back to metrics here, it&#39;ll be similar to what we have here.
I opened this up, all the course details at the tout top, then three tabs here, and they can scroll down and edit everything.
And then quick switch back to concessions and open up the next session.

So on the Ross, um, server, I pulled up, I&#39;ll send you this PDF. What they&#39;re trying to do is have this information at the top.
Um, and what we need to do is create a mock-up that adds, um, this logo, institutional logo, address and institution name at the top.
And then we could also put the, um, We can also put the, um, the name of the form. This is the name of the form, which is what we see here in the middle.
We can get rid of, um, this rotation evaluation form from the PDF. We don&#39;t really need that. And then here for this section, this would just be, you can just copy and paste it into there.
This we&#39;re going to put this into there, the description fields of the template, and we can pull it from there as for this gray section at the top, we need to make some tweaks to it so we can incorporate the, um, the student ID or students slash employee ID.
And then we can also, um, put the site name up the top. So the site name and the, uh, um, the ID.
So we can call this, uh, maybe, uh, trying to think about where to keep it clean. So evaluating and underneath here, we can put the ID and put the ID there.
And then for above the rotation name, we can put the site so it can be site, um, and the name of the hospital.
So instead of, so you can call it like, um, um, let&#39;s pull up one of their sites here And call it Mount Sinai hospital, and then I&#39;ll be above the rotation name and then the rotation, and then the dates.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e8a7678b03014ac48c3b811a7bd2340b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 21 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>And this first video, we&#39;ll take a look at what the curriculum looks like from a student perspective. So as a student, when you are scheduled to a course, you&#39;re able to go to the courses page and select the appropriate course, and it&#39;ll give you access to all the sessions for that.
So let&#39;s take a look at here, the foundations of medicine. If I go in here, I&#39;ll see my course details at the top, scroll down, and then I can click on a session.
So this particular one is a intro to lab safety, taking place at metrics, hospital who miles speaker or lecturer is all the keywords that are part of this, and then any content that&#39;s associated with this particular, the lecture.
So on this page, I can also filter by different themes and filter the sessions. I can also see which group that I&#39;m part of for the session and then search if I need to in real time.
And then I can also go to the top and switch to another course and see the sessions for that course.
And if I need to go back in time, there&#39;s all my historical records are stored here. I can switch back to the prior academic periods and see everything there on the search page.
I&#39;m able to go and search the entire curriculum. So this allows me to search, not just the courses that I&#39;m part of, but if I want it to, I can search.
Um, Um, actually I&#39;m going to take that back. So let&#39;s, uh, you&#39;re able to search the curriculum, um, for the courses that you&#39;re part of And here, what you&#39;re doing is, um, typing in different keywords and it allows them to, uh, bring up a page with the results and clicking in the expand button allows me to see how this particular objective is connected to the different schools objectives.
I can click on it and see more details about it. So this is the hierarchy from how the content is mapped to the school&#39;s objectives, which is probably not as relevant for students.
Um, it&#39;s, it could be a small section where we mentioned that we, they do have the ability to search the objectives.
And as for key words, I would actually, let&#39;s just skip the search section for students. It looks like we need to do some work here.
So this courses, page we definitely want to do. And then if we go to the calendar page, I can see, We may want to mention that it takes a little while to load on this page.
I can see in a month view all of the lectures that I&#39;m scheduled to. So this is coming from the curriculum.
I can see that this is the lecture where it&#39;s happening, what group I&#39;m in, and I can click on it to see more details about that.
The most important things to highlight here is the fact that you know, where the lectures are taking place, what group they&#39;re in.
So if there&#39;s like several groups in here, it will actually tell you which group they&#39;re in and able to see all the content that is associated with it.
And if you want to turn that show course dates on it. Also show you the different dates that the courses are running throughout the academic year.
And they can also sync this information with their external calendar by using the sync with calendar functionality.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b988096ea7fc42fd88e87908d23f1e84</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 8 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Raj wanted to create this quick video to show what the preceptors see when they&#39;re looking at a form. So I&#39;ve logged in as a preceptor, um, or faculty, they have similar portals.
So when I go to this portal, there&#39;s case logs that I have to approve, if that&#39;s something that they need to approve as part of the setup, but otherwise you can see here there&#39;s evaluations that I have to complete.
And then I go to the evaluations page, I&#39;ll see all the forms that are assigned to me, for me to complete.
And there&#39;s also forms that were completed on me. And when I go to the, for me section, see a list of all the forms and when it&#39;s due, what, um, um, if I did not work with the student, I can mark it as unable to assess.
I can also download a PDF if I like, but let&#39;s say if I open this up, it&#39;s something that will allow me to complete their evaluation for an individual trainee, the rotation that I work with them on, and then use one of these, um, scales.
This is all custom created. You can have Likert scales, multiple choice and so on, and this is also fully mobile optimized.
And in this particular form, we have turned on the ability to comment. It chooses a specific option. And if I complete this, you can also ride comments here.
There&#39;s also a support for confidential questions. If something needs to be, uh, specifically, it would be spent to the administrator, but the trainees should not be able to see that.
And there&#39;s also a signature option. If you need to collect signatures, they can pretty much draw a signature in like DocuSign.
And there&#39;s a way to send an alert. This a demo server has a custom alert text here. If I click this button, as soon as I submit this, it will send an email to administrator with a PDF attachment.
So this is what the form looks like. In addition to that, we have a way to do open evaluations. This is supposed to be an ad hoc form.
If you create a template, the user can just go in there, open it up and select a rotation and just completed on behalf of, uh, um, uh, for that person.
It could be an ad hoc forum for a trainee or a trainee can complete uncompleted on, uh, for the faculty, uh, popular use for this.
Uh, um, this is when they&#39;re working in some hospital and you don&#39;t know who they&#39;re going to be working with.
And as long as that, those users have an account and metrics, you can select them and submit this. And the other thing here is if I look at the about me section, I can open it up and see what was submitted on me.
The important thing is also all of tied To email notifications. So as soon as the foremost assign metrics, we&#39;ll send them an email with the information on who they needed to evaluate, including their photos.
And they can submit that without logging into the system. It saves a lot of time and, uh, streamline the whole process, um, for students and faculty.
And you can see here, it says the date that they viewed it. So we also monitor when someone reviews their evaluation and, uh, even if they download it from a PDF on the, on a email, we capture that information so we can make sure that the trainees are able to are reviewing their feedback.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ff7685f8a7804a63b6d97495ea9207ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So, this is just a slightly unrelated issue, but I wanted to just address it in this.

So because if they save it without adding their site or role and nothing will happen. So if they&#39;re going to turn the permission on, if they don&#39;t have at least one site selected, um, and the other thing that we can do is, um, make this a searchable field.
Um, I don&#39;t know why we didn&#39;t do that, but if this could be a searchable field so that, uh, when they have hundreds of these sites, it&#39;s easy to find what they&#39;re looking for.
So a surgical field, um, we can do an open, a beauty select if that works otherwise. Um, we can use the one that we do on the reports, and then we&#39;re going to, uh, make it required to have these fields filled in if the checkbox is turned on.
And, um, instead of saying, do you want to limit the users? We can just say select, um, select roles that the, uh, uh, select roles that the user will be able to create.

So we have this new permissions page that only appears for school medical schools. And in here, when we add permissions, we have something here for manage users and groups for sites.
So we can rename that to manage grouper users for sites and create a new entry, a new check box that is for managing groups for sites.
And in that we&#39;ll have the ability to select sites. So that&#39;ll be a new permission that we&#39;re adding. And the way that it&#39;ll work is if that permission is given on the personal portal.
Under the directory page, they&#39;ll see a groups tab and they can create, um, groups for that particular site. And, um, if they&#39;re given permission to manage groups or more than one site, they&#39;ll be able to pick which site they want to create the groups for.
So this is the update that we&#39;ll be making for the model. So if I&#39;m creating a new group, I&#39;ll have the ability to select the groups and the sites that the group is linked to.
And if you&#39;re a program admin and you&#39;re creating a group, it&#39;s going to allow them to specify which sites the group is linked to.
And that will allow the site administrators to add and remove individuals from those groups. So I have to create one more design here.
One is this is going to be for program administrators to use. And then another one is going to be for, um, the site coordinators.
When they&#39;re creating groups on their personal portal, under the directory, there&#39;ll be able to simply S um, create a group.
And if they have only one site they&#39;re managing the, they won&#39;t have to pick a site, but if they&#39;re linked to, they have the permission to create some groups for more than one site, there&#39;ll be, they&#39;ll see a check box to select which sites that group is linked to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/28703a6f94474d0fb74136b9a68293b3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>these reports for curriculum mapping relationships was something that existed when we had the whole hierarchical data structure for our standard curriculum mapping.
And when we redid everything from scratch for the Ross fed program, so that you can map from sessions to global and so on, these reports, uh, basically became, um, unusable for that.
So if you&#39;re using the hierarchy works, but if not, it doesn&#39;t. And our plan was after we finished the rework to start redoing to any of the reports in the new, in a new format for the, uh, uh, schools that are using it and without the hierarchy, but to, to the, um, all these other projects that have been coming up from the implementation thought that that, uh, report rework hasn&#39;t happened yet.
So in the meantime, I wanted to see if we can show this to Priti and get her feedback on, um, this report and see if it works, because if something else needs to be done, this is a good time for us to incorporate that since we&#39;re going to have to redo the report.
Anyway. Um, so for example, this is our demo server. And if I go in here, go to reports and go to curriculum app, I&#39;m able to choose a, um, global objective select all, and then choose session objectives.
Uh, for any of the sessions, this, this server doesn&#39;t have too many, uh, too much data, so I can do it directly to course objectives directly to the session objectives and so on.
So essentially I just select all and then generate a report or generate report and send as email if it&#39;s large report, and then this will pull up a spreadsheet that shows the relationships.
So you can see here, this is the global objectives to course objectives. And for each of these objectives will indicate whether a relationship exists as an ex, sorry, as a one or zero.
And on the, on the right side, it&#39;ll tally it up. Yeah. Total of mapping and along the same thing on the bottom, it&#39;ll give you totals.
So how many are mapped in each direction? We can mix and match things here. So you can say, show me all the relationships from the global objective to the session objectives from the, um, global objectives to the course objectives and so on.
So this one of the reports that we have for it, that we can update to support the, um, the new, the new, uh, mapping structure that we have, and the other is on the search page itself.
So when you are on this search page, you can search and see the relationships here. And then there&#39;s a way to download to PDF and download to Excel.
And this lists out all of the mappings here. So these two mapping now reports or visualizations were turned off when we did the rework of the curriculum, simply because they would not work with the new hire new hierarchical structure.
And we needed to redo each of them one by one. Um, it is something that is still on our agenda in our queue to do.
Um, why don&#39;t we just spend, we just have so many tasks with these multiple implementations that we&#39;re doing. So first step is for us to get some feedback from PT on, um, which of these is more useful.

This model has a view tree select where we can search for a user and dispute tree select should show the users similar to the way that we have it here, where it&#39;s going to group them by role, and you can expand.
So that&#39;s going to be this field. And then the second field is going to list out all of the programs that are active, so all active programs.
And then there&#39;s a little check box to select all programs. And then, um, if you also check this, turn this checkbox on, we&#39;ll also affiliate them with those all programs.
So remember that the program affiliations that currently done on the edit demographics page and what this check box will do is make sure they&#39;re affiliated with all of them.
So the first check box will just make them, sorry, selecting them as an administrator. We&#39;ll just make them administrator, but adding this check box will also make them affiliated with all of those programs.
So it&#39;s possible for them to be administrator without being affiliated and affiliated users appear on the user&#39;s page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ec42e582e59f421587a8cf332b4614a3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(1) Add work hour violation response categories</pre></td><td><pre>So this is an update to the work hours module. So the first thing that we&#39;re going to do is in the institutional portal, we&#39;ll add a new tab called workout response, uh, reasons.
It&#39;s our work, our foundation reasons. And here, we&#39;re going to copy the document types tab here and it&#39;ll work very similar to that except, um, we&#39;re going to have a way to create a new, sorry, this should say violation reason.
Just go add that here. No violation reason. And then when you create that, it&#39;s gonna bring up a model with a field type in the name of the reason and the, um, once it&#39;s created, it will appear here and we&#39;ll have the ability to edit deactivate and delete should only be able to delete if the violation reason hasn&#39;t been used somewhere else.
Um, the duty hour violations page, we currently have this ad, your justification, uh, above this field, we&#39;re going to add a dropdown called select reason.
So reason will be a dropdown and then they can write a comment in here. Um, we want to rename this field to trainee comments and administrative comments.
So instead of w uh, write your justification, we&#39;re going to say, um, trainee, trainee, uh, sorry. I&#39;m going to just correct this here.
Response administrative response. Sure. Your response then ease up. Popovers are going to be renamed to train your response administrative response, and then for the trainee portal.
Okay. Change a few things here. It says justify violations. It&#39;ll the response violation. We&#39;re going to add this select reason for violation dropped down about the, uh, comment field, and we&#39;re going to rename to additional details for the comment field.
And we&#39;re also going to update the violations tab instead of justify, will remain renamed to respond and change the view notes, but things have your response button here.
Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8ad19dc7614940f9b5fa4c493e046e57</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>FW: MeSH terms for key words - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jess wanted to create this video since it&#39;s, uh, easier to explain, uh, this is the list that we have currently, which is the full list of mesh terms, which is from the NIH.
And each of these terms are, um, categorize based on these code. So the AAO to his musculoskeletal system, inside of the musculoskeletal system, you have different categories.
And that&#39;s indicated by the second section here and then sub categories, which is indicated by the third set of codes.
So it goes into what 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 levels of hierarchy to get very granular. At the end of the last call, what I had mentioned was we can, um, um, remove the last layer here or maybe two layers, however they want to, how are they decide so that the list is more consolidated.
So you&#39;re going to be removing the sub sub sub or categories. So you don&#39;t need to go about every link, single, um, anatomical structure, but the more broad categories of those anatomic structures.
So that&#39;s what I mentioned at the end of the last call. But at that point, someone on the call had asked if we can include USM a li keywords and NBME keywords.
So these are independent keywords that were generated. We don&#39;t have a copy of that right now, but I believe someone said that they were going to send it to Kevin or upload it, send it to us, and they wanted to see if we can combine them.
Um, so combining the keywords is a good idea in theory, but each of these lists are going to be very long and they&#39;re there, there will be duplicates.
Um, so we need to see both all three lists and see if there&#39;s a way for us to combine them and remove the duplicates, using some sort of script or something.
Um, cause it&#39;s, it&#39;s impossible to do that manually. So, uh, it would be helpful to follow up and see if there is a spreadsheet with those lists that one of the deans have.
And then we can take a look at it to see if we can combine them. Um, but otherwise for this particular list, what we need to know is, um, up to what level of the hierarchy they want to go.
And then we can strip this down into a shorter list and import that if, uh, if the school wants to get started with this list,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/92820443694344f6a5172cadd62be77b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So we&#39;re going to review a few of the things that MSU needs to set up. So the first thing is for rotations, they had loaded all the rotations into the system, but the code that they&#39;re using is the curriculum code right now.
And with this new set of documents that was sent over to us, Yeah. Sent over to us. They have a code in here that indicates what type of rotation it is and what the minimum number of weeks there are.
So we may want to ask them to change the code, to match that this is something that can be discussed and done later, if necessary, after that want to get into the discussion about schedules.
So when creating block schedules, our recommendation is to create a separate block schedule for each site. So in this case, uh, this first one would be Patrick&#39;s hospital east and come here and you can select that particular site.
And then also specify which coordinator is going to be the administrator for this. If you specify an administrator here, this individual will be able to edit the, this schedule from the personal portal without having access to the admin portal.
When it comes to including students on the schedule, we can have them select individually because what they&#39;re doing is putting a bunch of students for each site.
And the goal of the local coordinators are supposed to do specify the rotations that they&#39;ll be taking at that site.
So they can simply come in here and select the individual students. That&#39;ll be assigned to a particular site and then be done with it, or they can create a group for metrics hospital east, and then put those students into it and then turn on that group here to LinkedIn.
And then they can create the block schedule using the auto-generate feature or going here and click manage blocks and tweak it to make their own custom custom blocks When it comes to importing, uh, sorry, I&#39;m making the assignments itself.
They would just open it up and click into it to assign it. But since they&#39;re going to be collecting things on spreadsheets, they can also do this using a import.
So there&#39;s two imports that needs to be done. The first thing is importing using the import block schedule functionality, where they would click here, download a template, and they&#39;re going to fill that template out, um, which would have all of those settings necessary to create the schedule includes entering an academic period, uh, scheduled name, specifying which site it is based on the site code, specifying the administrators, using their email address and specifying either the individual users such as the medical students or the groups that they&#39;re going to be part of.
And then we&#39;ll have, they&#39;ll have separate roles for each, um, block that is being created. So that&#39;s part of this import file.
And once that is set up, they would have to open up each schedule and import the assignments. So this also provides a downloadable CSV that can be updated to make the assignments here.
The next step, after that is to discuss permissions. So I go to system set up and permissions. I can click new permission and then select a user who may be a site coordinator.
And that site coordinator can be given permission to manage users for that site. So remember that when we created the schedule, you&#39;re giving them ability to edit the schedule, uh, that means that they can add or remove assignments.
But if they&#39;re, if they, if someone attend an attending physician from that hospital is missing from metrics, they will not be able to create that user by giving them managed user for site permission.
So metrics, hospital, east, or west or whatever it is, and then saying that they can set up preceptors. So with this permission, Maria will be able to create new preceptors from the personal portal, but only for the site metrics hospital west.
And this is a site level permission to be able to create and update user records. If I turned this on same thing here, if I give them access to the roles, this means that I can create groups and add preceptors to that group.
And this user group is going to be linked to the site that we specify here, but we don&#39;t need to go over the groups with the Michigan state, but we can tell them that we can create, uh, give them the ability to create new attending physicians or other preceptors.
Same down here. We also want to show them about evaluations. If I turned us on that means Maria will have the ability to see evaluations that were assigned for any rotation that is linked to this metrics hospital west site.
So a site coordinator will be able to track and view evaluations that were done for rotations that were, um, for, for students that were scheduled to that site or different rotations case logs.
Also, we can do that, but it&#39;s not necessarily to cover that during this meeting, since they&#39;re going to be, uh, discussing case logs for a further, but the site level permissions allow them to give site coordinators more permissions than what&#39;s available on the personal portal.
Lastly, if we want to get into the evaluation templates page, one of the things is going to is the assignment rules.
So going into the assignment rules and then filling out this information here to make sure that an evaluation goes out and if they have not received the, uh, user upload document, we can also review that with them.
So since they&#39;ll be starting to work with that, um, so that as soon as the contract is signed press to get those site coordinators, preceptors, uh, uploaded.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a92e4968e9ac459ba77fbd8f96e3da0b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled document - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>So Ken, we don&#39;t need to talk about, um, we didn&#39;t need to talk about anything before you sent that email.
My main goal in having a call was to explain for me to just explain the changes I made. So we are getting into a, um, consistent, uh, style of how we write the emails.
So for example, everything in here is good. I added a loom video. These loom videos have been very helpful for them.
So whenever we need them to complete something, it&#39;s good to include like a two minute little video explaining what they need to do.
And they&#39;re more likely to have that completed in time since they it&#39;ll be clear this section. I really like, I didn&#39;t include this in my email last time.
So we can start using this in all of our follow-up emails and for the action items, added a couple of things for anything that, um, we can complete as part of the email, we can just send it to them instead of saying we will supply it.
So I included that. And then one other thing that we want to do fraction items to sort of tell them when to estimate this, uh, this to be completed.
So in the future, we can say estimated completion, date or something. So they know when to expect this for the CU team sessions here, the, the major changes I made was, um, being specific on what we want them to do.
The first one is an example of what I changed. Initially. It said designate all institutional administrators. And I sort of wanted to them to know exactly what they mean, what we mean by designate.
So I just said, email us a list of all the users who shouldn&#39;t be administrators, and then also explained for site management this, that way, they know, um, why were I need that information and who should be made institutional administrators for the second one where we need them to upload the program name I put in here?
What exactly we want them to type in there. So they should either specifies a primary care acute care. So that way they don&#39;t need to try to figure out what to add there.
And then for staging environment, um, it&#39;s good. This is something that they don&#39;t need everybody to have access. We can say this.
This is what the staging environment is. And so to ask, who will use the staging environment. And if the staging environment is only going to be used by specific individuals, we can have a call with them to teach them how to use it, um, rather than just provide the credentials.
And then for the optional, this adding site contact for sites, they said they may not want to do it. So I just put optional in front of it.
So the, the major, uh, you know, or it&#39;s not a major it&#39;s minor, the changes that I made was trying to be specific with the action items for them, and then including a loom video and any links directly to that email.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1dd4950c421940b2a635c39edf0987a7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, this is one of the suggestions that Ken brought up. Um, whenever we are showing the academic year, we always want to show it in one standardized way, whereas either ascending or descending right now, some pages are showing ascending some phase showing descending.
So I think we can just standardize it and maybe show it as a sending. So block schedule and shift schedule or ascending order.
But if you go to work hours and you go to, uh, violations, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s the opposite. Um, where the oldest one is showing at the top.
So we can put that in ascending order. Same thing here under reviewed tab, institutional portal, um, work hour logs, I&#39;m sorry, violations.
There&#39;s all, there&#39;s an academic period here under past years, that should also be changed so that the it&#39;s in ascending order.
And then we can also just click around to the reports to see how we, how we&#39;re doing that there in case she, I don&#39;t think we have anything there.
And of course, so just those four pages. And if you see any of the ones that, uh, like, like on the curriculum page, go to, um, school of medicine actually,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/efe3a24f3cfd4510a58e693a24b05441</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>St James – Figma - 1 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So as part of the St. James implementation planning and their discovery meetings, we had come up with three solutions for them.
So what I&#39;m doing here is simply creating a visual so that we can present that to them in the meeting.
And it&#39;s also going to be helpful for handing that off to other team members to help, uh, implement the solution.
So in Figma, all we need to do is sort of use the rectangle tool and the arrows to create the diagram.
So we have students submitting rotation requests, and then that will be turned into real-time notifications to the administrator who will be updated in block schedule.
And then as soon as the block schedules, um, updated, All of these people aren&#39;t going to be have real time access to this information.
And then one more thing that we can add here is I also think this with an external calendar iOS or Google calendars So this helps us manage the scheduling component.
So for this one, we have site coordinators, Lock this down psych coordinators. They&#39;re going to submit before I&#39;m just copying and pasting control C control B, and then we got site coordinators, submitting sip files to the administrators, make sure the fonts are correct.
And then from there And then what can be done is in metrics  and once it&#39;s in there, good morning.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5aeaee4b64cb4924ae3b6635e39dbb5a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, now that we have a couple of the programs set up next step is to configure the institutional portal and we&#39;re going to be dealing with the hospital side first.
And once we do that, we&#39;ll do some setup for the institutional. Um, sorry, sorry. The medical school side of the, uh, organization.
So the first thing we need to do is create the institutional administrators to set up those administrators. We&#39;re still going to be logged in as the admin user and then go to the users page on the left side and from the users page, what we can do is create users.
So there are two types of users that we&#39;re going to set up. One is a faculty user, um, for the CIO, which are the institutional leaders, we&#39;re going to use faculty and for GME coordinators, we&#39;re going to use staff.
And after we set up a create a user, let&#39;s also review a couple of things.
When we create the user, we&#39;re going to put the, uh, primary program as one of the hospital programs that we created, either internal medicine or surgery.
And then down here, we can leave the password blank. We do need to have an email address. You can always use app metrics lab for this, uh, email and then for home institution.
It&#39;s, um, uh, we&#39;re going to use one of the sites that we created, uh, for home institutions. We want to make sure we choose the internal site.
Um, when we set that up and for role, we&#39;ll use our, uh, Dio role for that. And
For GMA coordinators, we&#39;ll use the GME coordinator roles.
And once they&#39;re set up, we need to give them permission to the institutional portal. So to do that, he will select those users, click access, and make sure that they have access to the institutional portal.
Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c824e956476d41d4be8d8d3d2755524b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled document - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Ken. So you didn&#39;t have to wait for me to send that email main thing that I wanted to talk through was my reasoning for some of the changes that I&#39;ve made.
It&#39;s uh, so that, so we&#39;re building up a consistent framework for these follow up items because, so we can re reuse it for, uh, the style for all of our implementation.
So I&#39;m going to just explain the changes I made. So for example, at the top, the loom videos have been very helpful for them to find an a and complete certain tasks since they&#39;re not really familiar with our system.
So whenever we need to, uh, have them complete something, it&#39;s good to include it, a brief video summarizing, um, what needs to be done.
This section is really nice. Uh, this is not something that I have included in my last follow up email. So it&#39;s really good that we&#39;re going to be adding this summary of what we discussed for the action items for our side.
Um, only tweak I made here was, um, specifying that we need to give institutional administrators, but also added how they should complete something.
So sorry. Um, and, um, the actual, like, uh, supply for a spreadsheet for rotations and education experiences. Um, since we&#39;re already had that information, I just added the link here and talked about it in the video of both.
So the major changes I made was for the CU team side, um, since there are multiple team members and there are not familiar with the system, we want to be very specific with what they want to do and assume that they may not have taken notes or, uh, fully understood, but we sat on the call and, um, um, and then kind of explain in a very specific way.
So for example, um, I changed designate all institutional administrators to email us at the list of all users who should be institutional administrators this way, cause designated this, this is not something that they can do on their own, and they may not know what it means to designate someone.
So I just, I just asked them to send us a list for the upload users to upload I&#39;m sorry, update the users upload with program name.
So for that section, add information for the users upload, add primary affiliations, include preceptors and the upload sheet. So I broke that into two separate sections and then also gave them what options to enter, whether it&#39;s primary care or acute care and re-upload them to resources.
And I called a program name instead of, um, um, primary affiliation so that there we&#39;re using the language that they&#39;re With.
And for the preceptors in the rotations upload, there is a tab for preceptors that we had initially supplied them with.
Um, so I S I said in there that they can either upload it to the users upload or to the preceptors tab on the rotation spreadsheet.
This is more for me clarifying something that I talked to them about before. Um, and then for the last part staging environment, um, I added a section here, like who will need access to staging.
So we never trained them on that on a, on staging. So it&#39;s good for us to figure out who needs to have access and then do a call to train them on it so that we can show them how it works.
And then for this one, I just put optional in front of it so that they know that they don&#39;t have to do it if they don&#39;t need to.
And.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/65c88fff0ccc4d81a03c7d1a427aad9b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So Mike, so when we are looking at the curriculum here, I&#39;m in the demo server under school of medicine. And if I toggle into one of the residency programs, let&#39;s say internal medicine, you&#39;ll see that the curriculum disappears from the left menu.
So our next, our goal here is, is to have a S uh, a simpler version of the curriculum available to the residency programs without having the, all the bells and whistles that we have for curriculum.
So the first step is for us to start cutting down on what we need to have. So under a curriculum, what we can do is remove everything except for, except for the, um, the sessions page, and then the, um, session searched and set up, we can keep.
And then for within each of those, we want to hide the objectives and mappings page from the search page. Want to remove the objectives, actually, Ashley, let me, let me take that back.
So on the sessions page, we can, um, remove the mappings page and the, um, from the search page, we can remove the, um, the objectives tab and just keep keywords and content tab and on the session setup page, Um, we could Yeah, we&#39;ll keep all of these for now.
Cause I think some of them needs to be removed, but let&#39;s get to that later. So the I, the first version we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll have curriculum with sessions, search and set up in sessions.
We&#39;ll remove the mappings in search, we&#39;ll remove the objectives and, um, set up we&#39;ll keep as it is. So it will, this is how we&#39;ll it&#39;ll appear.
If the program type is a residency. And remember that if I go into the company portal and go to a particular program, look at it, and this is if it&#39;s set up as a GME, it&#39;s a residency program.
UME is medical school. So we&#39;re not going to change anything for the UME, but if it&#39;s set up as GME, we&#39;re going to show the curriculum.
We&#39;re going to show what the, these three links, everything else will be hidden. Same. We can actually apply it for GME and for nursing and allied health.
So right now it&#39;s hidden for nursing allied health. Instead we&#39;ll reveal those three pages for GME nursing and allied health.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b4a5978b182c45949ea5401ae24a24ea</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU - New AY Workflow - Google Docs - 30 November 2021</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll review the steps to update metrics for a new academic period. So when a new anchor new semester or a new session is starting, there are certain things that needs to be updated metrics so that it&#39;s getting is set up for the new, um, students and preceptors.
Um, some of these steps will be automated in the future when there&#39;s integrations and the meantime they need to be manually updated.
So first thing is making sure that we import the new users. So in order to do that, we would go to the users page for each of the programs.
So there may be multiple programs and metrics for each program going to the users page and clicking on. Let me see if I can go to another program that has import capabilities.
There&#39;s an import users button at the top left click on it. You can download a spreadsheet and this can be used to update, um, the student&#39;s information and then submit that file and metrics will import those users.
They can also be manually set up by clicking the add person button and for faculty and preceptors use the faculty option here for students use a student option and they will be created and metrics for students always choose your university as the home institution.
And then for preceptors choose the home institution as the organization that, um, employs them for any students that are graduating or any preceptors that are no longer working with students, it&#39;s best to deactivate their program affiliations, to deactivate an affiliation.
Uh, we&#39;ll click that button. That&#39;ll bring up a screen that lets you decide what you want to do with their accounts, whether it&#39;s canceled their pending evaluations, if there&#39;s any, uh, any documents that are active, what to do with them.
And then most importantly specify their, um, new role. So always want to select a student and set them as alumni and for preceptors or faculty, you can just leave them as it is.
Um, or if you want to create a, um, role, if we&#39;re retired or anything like that, if we can do that, but usually for preceptors is okay to leave their role and then just deactivate them.
But for students update them to alumni so that that&#39;s documented. And if there&#39;s a need to document future jobs where they got hired, you can put that in there and update that here.
As part of the deactivation process, any deactivated users can still be accessed in metrics, uh, by going to the affiliation status, active inactive, and then the act and then Sue choosing inactive and you will be able to see them and they can be reactivated.
If you need you to come back for any reason for updating site, this can be done on the sites page and on the sites page for the program portal, you&#39;re able to see all the sites that are part of the organization and it&#39;s good to review them to make sure they&#39;re up to date, but if they need to be updated currently, it needs to be done on the institutional portal and the designated administrators to be able to go in there and, um, create new sites or deactivate old sites.
And this also has an import file that can be used to import sites in bulk. When you open up a site, the most important thing to update is the site name and the site ID.
The other items on here are optional, but they can be updated if, if that&#39;s, um, important for tracking once the sites are updated, the next thing is on the admin portal.
We need to update the rotations. So under rotations in system setup, you&#39;ll see all of the rotations that are part of the, um, that particular program and each rotation has a name and it&#39;s linked to a site it&#39;s good to in a certain instances, looking at the prior rotations and how they&#39;re named, if the rotation name includes the site name, it&#39;s good to include that so that it&#39;s keeping a maintaining standard for your organization.
And then for each rotation, clicking on this first icon will allow you to designate any preceptors for that. So as part of the user import, any new preceptors should have been added and then those preceptors can be linked to their respective rotations.
So this only needs to be done for any new sites, new preceptors and new rotations, the ones that are already there for the previous semesters, you don&#39;t need to do anything.
If a rotation is no longer being offered, that can be updated also, and that rotation can be deactivated. So let&#39;s go back to admin portal here, rotations, and then they can click this deactivate button to deactivate them and they will appear in the inactive tab afterwards.
So that&#39;s updating rotations, update, adding preceptors rotation, then update the evaluation templates. So if I go to evaluations and templates, you&#39;ll see all the templates that have been created for the organization and for this particular program.
So important to update these with any new rotations that are created. So if five new rotations are created and you have an evaluation form that is assigned based on a rotation, you would want to go into the assignment rules, go into the rotation section and make sure you click the add button to include them.
So that metrics picks them up when they&#39;re, when it&#39;s doing automatic evaluations. Lastly, it&#39;s good to review the case templates that are set up and make sure that all the case templates are correct.
The appropriate diagnosis and procedures are in there. If anything needs to be activated or deactivated, that can also be done as part of the setup process.
So those are the things that are required, um, to make sure that metrics is ready for a new semester. And actually one more thing that I wanted to add here to the last part is once the rotations and evaluations are set up, of course, there&#39;s also the schedules.
So the student&#39;s schedules need to be added into metrics so that metrics and the students know who&#39;s working where, and, uh, all the evaluation automated automation relies on the schedule to, uh, notify the students and preceptors, uh, when evaluations need to be completed.
So that is the last step. I&#39;ll add that here. All right. Thank you. And hope that was helpful in setting up a new, um, setting up a system for new academic period.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/98e3acedc9d44d65ac1ffc4415ff8105</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Company Portal</pre></td><td><pre>In this first video, we&#39;ll take a look at the company portal. So metrics company portal is something that&#39;s only accessible to our team, and it&#39;s where we configure different settings and turn on different things and also troubleshoot problems when somethings happen, go wrong.
And it is a confusing place to start off in. So let&#39;s just acknowledge that and we are working on making some improvements here, but the first and most important thing to know is that you access this portal by logging in as the admin and metrics, lab.com.
Every server has one super admin user that has this privilege. And, um, I, when you log in as this user, you&#39;re taken to a page where you have a couple of menu items on this main menu, and then you have this sub menu.
So this a sub menu has all the, um, items that are necessary for the company portal.
And this left side is just the, uh, um, regular system menu by default. So if I arrive on this page, I&#39;ll have the regular system menu for internal medicine.
Um, and I can see here, I&#39;m in the admin portal for internal medicine. I can switch to the institutional portal if I want to.
Um, but if I open up anything in the company portal, so if I click on programs, it will, it will take me back.
Take, take me to the page where I can manage programs. And if I click home, it&#39;ll take me back here.
So if I click on residency code, take me there. Then I got to keep either hitting this logo or hitting the home button to go back to this page.
Um, this left menu is not something that we need to use when you&#39;re in the company portal. Um, except if you want to, uh, use the system as if the client would be using it.
Um, but if you&#39;re a focus on just regular setup and, and, uh, troubleshooting problems, this company links is what needs to be used to get started.
I will just focus on certain pages on here. So for example, the programs page is where I can add a new training program.
So if I want a new Adonai training program, I can just give it a name and then click add program and it&#39;ll add that program.
So when you open up a particular program, there&#39;s different settings that can, that can be configured. Uh, for example, it can specify the type of training it is GME versus UME versus allied health and nursing.
Um, also turn on different roles that we want to use for that particular training program. So if this was a residency program with three years of training, we may want to turn on PGY one, two and three for medical students.
You may want if it&#39;s a, this a medical school, because turn on Ms. 1, 2, 3, 4, it all depends on what type of, uh, individuals that are going to be working or training in this, uh, allergy program.
So once the programs are set up, we can also create roles. So the roles page it&#39;ll show us all of the different types of roles that exist on the server.
And we can add new roles when we make a new role, you can give it internal or external specify, which, um, type of portal they need access to, or there&#39;s the faculty resident, fellow or so on.
Each of these portals have different functionality. Yeah. And then the other, um, useful thing on this page is, um,
Okay, &lt;inaudible&gt;
The initial setup is institutional profile where we can configure the name of the institution and upload a logo, which gives us, uh, um, this information at the top.
So even though this looks very confusing as part of the initial setup process, there&#39;s really only three pages that are relevant.
It&#39;s going to be the program page, the, um, institutional profile and roles. And then once that is done, uh, the next step after that is going to be creating users and then</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/554a1ac6e6364178b9be61b9743c607f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this is a, a couple of, uh, different tasks that we can work on. So first thing is the, on the requirements page, we have the ability to create these requirements and assign them to people.
So essentially you create a specify what you want them to submit, select the roles, and then assign it. If you&#39;re doing it from the institutional portal, you can say which program level people need to do it.
But if you&#39;re doing from the program portal, you don&#39;t get the option to select programs. So you just select the roles or groups and rural individuals.
Um, so that it works fine while we want to change here is at the bottom. Um, we can, we want to update a, um, setting that says this is only for institution or AOM administrative use.
So if you say that this is for administrative use or administer only for administrators to submit, and that checkbox is turned on, then when this gets assigned to the user.
So let&#39;s say I create a document called, um, onboarding document. I assign it to all the first, second and third year residents.
And I turn on the setting to say, this is only for administrators submit. This requirement will appear in that particular residence portal.
So let&#39;s say if I log in as one of our users here, let&#39;s, um, Perry Cox, and I go to the requirements page.
You can see that I have requirements that are assigned to me and I can go in there and complete it.
But if it was set up to be administrative submission only, you&#39;ll still see it. But it&#39;ll say on here, um, incomplete and another label at the bottom that says administrative submission only, and I won&#39;t be able to complete it.
I&#39;ll just see that it was there. And once it&#39;s completed, it&#39;ll say, uh, completed. And then you can click the, uh, it&#39;ll have a, um, a view button and you can view with lowest submitted, but not edit anything.
So I would say the best thing is to, um, assign a requirement to a user, go through the process of completing it, go to the administrative portal, go to the assignments page, view it and approve it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a262ed977a714b3b8b37506af339fee4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this one, when I try to add a role, um, well, we&#39;ll start from scratch or refresh this. And then if I click add rule and if I&#39;m missing something, it should give me an inline error in red that says, um, the role field, the internal, external, uh, the, uh, the portal should be required, which program should access this, and this should not be required.
So if I entered none of those, then I should give a message to tell me to fill those out. And, um, so if I start filling it out, let&#39;s say, Hey, cast internal, save.
And then, so this field should not be required, but let&#39;s go save that. I&#39;m not able to save it. Okay.
And then the other thing is in fact, to look at again, all the pre previous data still shows up there.
So we want to clear that each time we add a new role, other thing that I&#39;ve noticed is when I edit, I changed this to faculty and add another program here and it didn&#39;t change that.
So if I do it again, faculty, I&#39;m adding allergy update role. It gives me the confirmation, but when I click here, it&#39;s still not changed.
So you still staff. And if I also try to delete a role, see how we&#39;re doing it works.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/136c87a15d204df4ba26a2a441a412cf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this bug under curriculum, I go to session events. We have a way to edit PC events and you can see here, I can define colors for these, but if I close it, it doesn&#39;t show the color here.
Um, it should be having a little box next to it that shows that color when we are defining that. And we can also ask the dev to just standardize these active and inactive.
So they&#39;re consistent. What, for example, for keywords is bold, but for session events is not. Then if I go to curriculum courses, click at it.
And in this particular list of directors, um, we should only be showing, um, users that are affiliated with this program.
Right now it&#39;s showing all faculty and staff users, um, that are in the, in the system, but it should only be showing users that are part of this particular program.
So if I go to here, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, there&#39;s only four faculty and staff users. But if I go to this edit program, it&#39;s showing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
More than that.

So for this particular setting on the sessions, upload CSV page, we have ability to download a template to format and upload into the system to match up the resources.
So this particular, this template is incorrect and we need to update it so that we can, uh, let the clients upload these, uh, resources.
So that&#39;s the support has a session code resource type title description, available students attachment. So if I go to the sessions page and I select the course, open it up, you&#39;ll see here we have add resource.
This has a title, Matt, their type. So they have to use the same exact text that they have here. And then the description here available for students and there&#39;s attachment one.
This should work similar to the, um, the instructional methods, um, attachment feature. So you can check that out and see how we should create the, uh, attachment option.
So when the, when the client clicks download template, this CSV will download and they&#39;ll be able to edit it and upload it back into the system and make sure that we are uploading it to the current academic year.
So if I clicked submit, it should link it to the August 21st academic year. That&#39;s selected at the top, and then it should link it to this appropriate session based on the code of the session.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6fd29d5a3a1e4e069d580bce66d63b63</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, everyone. I wanted to send this video along with these documents so that we can kind of provide some context to what they mean.
So we have, we had a team meeting today morning to review the keywords and figuring out what&#39;s the best strategy.
And here&#39;s, uh, what we&#39;re thinking. So the first document I wanted to show you is this Ross keyword and system.
So this document is the same as this one shows all of the keywords that have been added to the system so far, we just kind of pull it out of the database and you can see here.
Some of them are kind of broad, but when, once you get lower down, you&#39;ll see, they don&#39;t really have too much of a, um, structure.
There are some duplicates, and then you can also get into very granular things like a specific protein names and our thoughts on this.
And, uh, Maria had a, um, a lot of experience with, uh, curriculum mapping. She, um, her recommendations based on her experience with this has also to be a little bit more broad because once you get down to the protein levels of that, granularity is difficult to find relationship between sessions.
So the purpose of adding these keywords in the curriculum map is to see where similar topics are taught. If we are having specific protein names added as keywords, you&#39;re probably not going to find too many sessions that share that same type of keyword.
But if you go a little bit higher up and maybe, um, have keywords related to types of enzymes or however that may be grouped together, then it&#39;s easier to have a report or something that will pull up all of the different, uh, sessions that have that type of protein being taught.
So, um, so anyways, so I want to leave this document here. I&#39;m not sure how much of this you would want to save.
Um, but this is the actual export from the metrics as it is right now. The second document I want to share is this, um, actually before we get to there, I want to show you one.
So this is the original mesh document that we downloaded from the NIH website. And you can sort of see the hierarchy here where it&#39;s presented slightly differently, where you can see the first highest level of body regions.
Then you get to the second level, which is anatomic landmarks, and then you see the different anatomic structures. So this one has 61,000 terms in it.
This is the full list. And so that also is too much granularity and it gets a very too detailed. And you&#39;re not going to find too many relationship between the sessions, if you&#39;re getting down to the fifth or sixth level of the hierarchy.
So what we want, what we try to do is we just pulled the first two levels, um, of this hierarchy.
Here it is. So this document it&#39;s called mesh terms two level duplicate, sorted shows all of the mesh terms, only down to the second level of the hierarchy.
And this has about 2000 terms and there are some duplicates that we highlighted at the top. Um, you can see that the duplicates are next to each other.
You can see chart charts, um, but she&#39;s also looking at duplicates of the code. Um, so maybe that, not that many duplicates, but anyway, so this is about 2000 terms and I feel like, um, this may be a better starting point for the faculty to use and Maria who, um, has done a lot of these, uh, curriculum mapping, uh, work in the past.
This is also her recommendation. Essentially. We want to see some broad topics so that faculty can multiple, um, faculty from different courses can use that to link different sessions to it.
So when you run a report and where you want to find out where different sessions are teaching a specific topic, you&#39;re able to find a relationships, but if you get a too granular, then you&#39;re not going to find those relationships between sessions.
So this document has up down to this, uh, the second level and it has about 2000 terms in there. So, um, we can do, we can break this down into any level of the hierarchy if you like.
Um, but I want you to learn to start with the, to the second level and see if this, if this is a sufficient for you to start with, then the last document here is the keywords report that we ran directly from metrics.
And this document simply lists out all of the sessions that have keywords mapped to it. It&#39;s just so you can see how the faculty did their mapping.
Um, there, some of these key, some of these will have more than one, but each right now on this report, it shows one role for each keyword.
And so for example, you can see here, these two sessions share this key word, and I feel like the relationships may be made by the same faculty member.
Um, so I think if we change this process to a way that you&#39;re, you&#39;re standardizing the list of keywords and then meeting with the faculty members to get them familiar, familiar with these key new keywords and asking them to use those that would help standardize across the organization.
And then when someone comes across a keyword that doesn&#39;t exist in the system, they can submit that to the, uh, administrative team so that they can review it and make sure that it is something that you want to add.
So having some sort of process to review and approve new keywords, uh, will be a way to maintain this once we establish the baseline.
So please take a look and let us know if there&#39;s this, uh, second level of the hierarchy is good enough.
And then once we have that decided, then we can go ahead and import it and ask for the existing data in the system.
We can either add to it or have it wiped. And as a faculty to do a re remap, um, either as possible, but it&#39;s going to be very difficult, uh, to merge it together.
We can provide instructions on how to do that, but it&#39;ll be a very manual process to try and match up the existing keywords with a similar keyword for mesh.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3e217d61c16f4713b3d53315a263d73d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>In my XO for this particular one, we just need to go through each of the little dropdowns that we have in the system for a curriculum.

We want to make sure they&#39;re all alphabetical and also shows a course code next to it. And I can hear this is showing correctly.
Uh, this is alphabetical and the course code next to it. Um, it&#39;s actually better who put the course quote first and then the course name.
So just going through each of the pages and just, uh, correcting that. So here&#39;s, it&#39;s showing it code first and then the name, this is correct, but it&#39;s not nearly this alphabetical.
So this one is correct. So every page in the curriculum, as well as the curriculum reports would just need to standardize it and correct that.

First, a personal statement. I was hoping that you can send me a brief summary of your personal statement for the project, and you can dictate this on the iPhone and a notes app, and then just send me what you have and I can proofread it and edit it and tweak it and make it, put it into the document.
So this was an document I found online on how to write these. If you start off with, who are you in any re uh, rationale for being, uh, uh, interested in this project and specifically about creating these simplified reports for patients and what have you done to prepare, including where and when, and I, you may have, um, research that was done on this, but I think one of the things to highlight here is the work or initiative that you carried out throughout the department about, uh, unexpected interest in the findings and any impact that may have had on the patients, and then why you&#39;re uniquely qualified, including past accomplishments.
And I feel like this is an area also where being the chairman and having a long background in radiology, and specifically in Philadelphia, that can be highlighted and then including what&#39;s next and the potential for this project and how it can impact patient care.
Um, again, you can put this, uh, in, in a, in a quick, uh, note and I can help, uh, restructure it.
And then after that, the next section ID to help with this, this contributions to science. So this is an area where we can highlight any past work that has been completed, um, especially if it&#39;s relevant to the topic, and this is, uh, academic publications or major projects that were done.
And if you can pick out up to five projects that were done in the past that you want to highlight here and send me a few sentences about that project, and then I can put that in here along with a citation.
And so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the biosketch. And again, I I&#39;ll help, uh, create the template. I just need a, a, uh, a few notes about the personal statement and the contributions to science.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/11aced62b78a4e86849f03d336b989b8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Add Permissions for Viewing Case Logs</pre></td><td><pre>So this particular functionality is for adding permissions for case logs. So in order to complete this task, we have to look at two other tasks also that is still in development to a 9 4 7 2 9 9 5.
So the 2 9, 4 7 task adds a permissions page to system set up and the program portal. So the way that this works is if you click edit, allows you to add a permission here so that you can give specific individuals to put ability to do certain things.
So this page was added on this particular task, but we&#39;re also working on expanding that by adding ability to edit users and also case logs.
So we need, uh, this page from this particular 2 9, 4 7, in addition to that on 2 9, 5, 0, we&#39;re adding the ability to link rotations to case logs.
So let me pull that up. I apologize. It&#39;s not 2 9, 9, 5 is the one I&#39;m talking about this particular task. What we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re adding the ability to link rotations rotations to case locks.
So case templates we&#39;ll have this rotation field and remember that rotations are linked to sites. So this particular feature that we&#39;re starting on today for starting on this, this issue will require both the permissions page as well as the ability to link to rotations, to case to case logs.
So then what we&#39;re doing is adding a section at the bottom of the permission where we can say we use case logs for sites, and there&#39;ll be a way to select the list of sites, add a new permission section of the case for case logs, and that&#39;s on the permissions page.
So essentially at the bottom of this permission section here, we&#39;re going to add a way for us to select the case logs.
And then this will include a check box and turn it on. So that&#39;s the check box here. And then a site selector where you can select one or more sites.
If the permission is turned on and one or more sites are selected show the case logs page in the personal portal.
So if I go to Cox, go to personal portal, we will add a page under our, we&#39;ll make this into a dropdown.
We have cases and logs page underneath that, or let&#39;s see, we can call this review logs. Okay. The log page will only appear at the following criteria are met, essentially the case template have the rotation selected.
Um, and that rotation must be linked to one of the sites that this person has permissions to. So if I have metrics hospital as a search site that I have permissions to, then the rotations that are linked to that site must be selected on the template and the trainee log in the case must be scheduled to the same rotation at that site.
So if we have a template that&#39;s linked to cardiology, then the, the student must also be scheduled to cardiology at the same site, in order for this person to view that logs that are entered for that cardiology rotation.
And we also need to make some tweaks to the fields here. So for example, the trainee field or the Alicia users that were scheduled to the site on the block schedule, or have the site as a home institution and the demographics page supervisor dropped down on Lucia users that have sites as home sites, as homes, home institution.
Again, we&#39;re referring to the same sites that this person had permission to clinical sites should provide a list of all the sites the user has permissions for at a dropdown, uh, rotate and drop down that list.
So somewhere in here, we&#39;re going to add a rotation dropdown list out all the rotations that are linked to the sites that the person has permission is to note that some users may have permissions for more than one site.
So these Trump phones should have all of the sites. They have permissions for.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3d4a24711b7d40daa1ab824d588226e3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Microsoft Word - #5 Sample Biosketch - ESI 04-15-16</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Gary, for us to complete this project tomorrow that&#39;s submitted, we need to have a, a biosketch for each of the investigators, and this is a template and a sample that I found online, and we can help, uh, format this for you.
I have, I may have some time later today to help you do that, but there are a few sections in here that I need you to help with.
And I&#39;m thinking that you can maybe use the notes app on, on the iPhone and simply just dictate it and I can edit it and format it into the, uh, into the document and make tweaks to it.
So for the personal statement, it can follow this model where starts off sort of explaining who you are background in, uh, radiology and, and, uh, and, and being the chairman of the department and work in Philadelphia.
And then what have you done in the past that is relevant to this project? So, you know, maybe talking about the, um, unexpected incidental study, uh, pro initiative findings initiative that you had taken in the department and the impact it had, um, why you are qualified for this and any accomplishments from the past and maybe relevant, and then any, um, uh, potential of this project in the future.
And, and, and I can help, uh, edit that for you once you get that over to me. And if there&#39;s any specific research publications that you want to include, that is relevant to that, you can just explain that in the, um, in the note, and I will pull that from your CV, for the honors positions and honor section, I&#39;ll pull this from the CV, but I noticed that some of them don&#39;t have dates on it, so I&#39;ll do my best.
And then I&#39;ll send it to you to, um, add any dates that may be missing. Then this contributions to science is an important section.
And I feel like, um, this would be a good, uh, between me, you and Mindy. I believe you have the most, uh, uh, experience, uh, in any, in the strongest CV.
So from the computer science side, uh Slobodan and Ray have a lot of research and grants and publications. I think it, from a radiology side, it&#39;d be good to highlight some of your research since, uh, uh, I don&#39;t have that much, uh, research background.
So if you can pick out, um, five projects up to five projects that may be relevant to this, or close to this, uh, something about providing access to radiology reports or imaging, if you have any, any of those, uh, if not some something that is, uh, um, that involves significant, uh, research, um, from your CV and that, and just give me two or three sentences about each.
And I will Put that in here along with the citation. So for me, I&#39;m only including any post, a couple of poster, presentations and lectures that I gave, because that&#39;s all I had done.

Um, and then the other thing is we also will only, um, show this on the residency programs because we won&#39;t be using this for the medical school programs, um, or the nursing school programs.

If it&#39;s on the by procedure tab, and then for the apply trainee tab, we&#39;ll show the, uh, the order to show the role.
We want to show the, uh, their primary program next to it. So this way they can figure out which trainee and what their specialty is.

If they select a procedure, we&#39;ll have this new section at the top that shows the procedure name, the primary program, the minimum required supervisor approval required or not.
And then if, if a case description has been added, we&#39;ll show a button that says view case description. So this is coming straight from the templates page here.
So we&#39;ll see those minimum require supervisor coral needed. And then if you click edit, you&#39;ll see there is a description field.
If anything is added here, it&#39;ll appear on there. Then the next part below that as if, if you select a trainee or a procedure with no entries, currently we show this blank table with nothing there.
So instead of that, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll be showing, um, a alert that says, um, there&#39;s no trainees who have completed the requirements for this case.
And then show the button to show all the trainees below the load, this alert, um, if they have no procedure selected, we&#39;ll just have a simple alert that says, please select a, uh, procedure, a trainee or procedure above to get started.
And then on the, by training, by trainee tab, if they select a trainee who has not completed any requirements, we&#39;ll show this text and then with the button underneath it, and for by trainee, we&#39;re going to show their name, role photo, their primary program, as well as their work phone number, pager and email address.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cf7b234fcbc642b997a4c612d7a261c4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this demo, um, I&#39;ll just talk as if I&#39;m presenting it to them. So what we wanted to do was review metrics, a preclinical functionality to it a little bit and provide a summary of what we have available for the school to use.
And this goes in income it&#39;s is a complimentary to the PDF that we&#39;re providing that outlines. What are some of the things that we have planned for the future?
So from the metrics administration or portal, a school can plan out their entire curriculum. This includes building out the entire course roster, and this can be synchronized with your banner or other platform that you&#39;re using for student information.
And it includes, uh, the different directors and faculty members that are overseeing those courses. And for each of those courses, we can also, uh, define groups that are linked to those.
Each group can contain students as well as preceptors or faculty that overseeing that. And then for every course, we also have a way to create all the lectures and labs that have happened during those sites and each, each of those items have a variety of components to it, including the keywords content.
So lectures and other things can be added here. And the nice thing is this can be given, uh, you can give permissions to courses, to different faculty members and they can help create and manage the content.
They can also adjust the schedule as needed. You can see here that an anatomy lab is happening on certain day and you can invite the groups to it.
And they will see that on the calendar, which we&#39;ll be looking at in a few minutes. And then there&#39;s also ways to search the content.
So you can search by objectives and find how the curriculum map is all linked together. And then there&#39;s also ways to search for keywords.
So if I want to search for endocrine system, it&#39;ll give me the sessions that have that Key word, and then there&#39;s content Searching for any sort of files or documents that are part of the different, um, sessions.
It can be searched and downloaded all in one place. So that&#39;s the administrative side with a quick setup. And, um, the schedules page brings together the entire curriculum and what the schedules are.
And if I want to open that up, I&#39;ll see what&#39;s coming up for this particular course. And if I need to make changes to schedule coordinators can go in there and make changes to those particular lectures labs or small group sessions.
And then next we&#39;ll take a look at what it looks like from the student&#39;s side. So if I log in as, um, Carla Espinosa here, you&#39;ll see there are, um, multiple items on the dashboard, but do you have for announcements here, upcoming lectures, upcoming lectures and labs on the right side.
And then if I go to my calendar, I have my academic calendar here. This includes, uh, any sort of welcome dinners, orientation events.
And then my actual academic events have a click on it. It shows me which course it is, which lecture it is.
And then along with the keywords learning methods, assessment methods, and resources that are part of that, I can also download the content.
So all of this functionality is already available in the platform and it can be used for managing the preclinical. And then there&#39;s a great book and, um, the lottery as well as a student week view that we&#39;re working on, which we are shown in the separate PDF.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/56569c825a084bb3905f79dcefc816f0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Case Logs – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Kevin, for this task that we talked about last week, we wanted to check with you if this will meet the requirements.
So on the, uh, at the top of each category, we were thinking that we can add the count. So this is sort of showing the total diagnosis that are in there.
The total number of diagnosis, 400, I&#39;m just making these numbers up, but, and then the total required is counting up the actual number of requirements.
So if there&#39;s one, it&#39;ll be counted once, if there&#39;s two, it&#39;ll be counted twice and so on. And then total scene is giving the count of the number of times they saw all of the cases.
So again, just like the total minimum required, it&#39;ll count the, uh, it once if the, the hilly side once, if they saw it five times, it&#39;ll count to five times and so on.
And number left to see it&#39;s just subtracting the total required from the total scene and telling that up. And then total requirements met.
It&#39;s going to give the number of greens, the yeses out of the total, um, total required from total diagnosis. So this, this should actually be second.
It should be 300 out of 400. So the total diagnosis is 400 and out of those, yeah, there are 300 yeses.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6ffe6fed0f424db0843017db947aaa5e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So this first permission that we want to add is for allowing the specific users to create an edit sites. So right now the sites are managed from the institutional portal by institutional administrators.
This new permission will allow us to give program administrators, the ability to manage sites. And so on the system set up and permissions page, we would add, um, when we add a new permission, select a user, and here we&#39;re going to add another check box at the bottom that says, allow, uh, creation and allow, sorry, we can call it manage, um, manage, um, sites.
And I dunno, I think we can just call it, manage size and keep it simple. And then it&#39;ll have an explanation says, this will give, uh, so-and-so the ability to create and edit sites that are having at it, uh, sites for this, um, organization.
And we don&#39;t need to give them the ability to specify which sites we&#39;re just going to have a blanket permission.
Like the first one we have here, where we&#39;re giving them the ability to, um, edit any site. And once that site permission is added, when they go to the sites page, either from the program, admin portal, institutional admin portal, or from the personal portal, they&#39;ll see the app site button, and then they&#39;ll be able to open it up and make edits.
So everything that they can do on the institutional portal right now, we have the ability to view the activate, create a new site.
And then when you&#39;re viewing it, you have the ability to add leaders, permission, uh, rotators, and so on. All of this will become available to the individual who has been given permission to manage sites.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e247a2fc27ef43c9a4061dd397ea81b6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Backlog | !Design</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, for this particular task, personal portal about me tab, display a tag or filter to identify forums that have already been viewed.
So, um, I go to metrics whenever we talk about the personal portal, this is the portal that each user has access to it.
And there are four different types of personal portals. There&#39;s the resident portal, the student portal, faculty portal and staff portal.
And, um, each of these will have an evaluations page. And on this page, you can see anything that was completed, um, on them and all the ones they have to complete.
And then the about me will show all the ones that was completed on them. So what we&#39;re trying to show here is, um, adding a status that tells the trainee that he or she has already viewed it.
So over time, there will be many evaluations in here and, you know, maybe 20, 30, 40, a hundred, depending on what your, their training.
And, um, and right now we don&#39;t really have a way to tell them that I already read this evaluation. So sorta like an inbox and saying which ones you read in, which only have in red.
So I think, um, we can either do something like, um, having, um, A, a little, um, icon or something that says new, um, if it&#39;s new or we can try, um, using something like a bold, um, um, if it&#39;s new and then if it&#39;s not an, if it&#39;s already been ready to be, um, uh, not bold so that we can experiment with that to see what&#39;s the best way.
But the idea is to highlight all the new ones or the ones that they haven&#39;t read yet. And also adding a filter at the top so that, um, they can say they can, um, pick the ones that they haven&#39;t viewed and review them.
So maybe having a button at the top of saying show all unread, uh, evaluations, and that will filter down all the ones that they haven&#39;t read yet.
Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ad784f217ac644faaa7391d61ef68b33</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So here&#39;s a small design project that you can knock out. So right now, in the program portal, let me switch to the program portal and go to the user&#39;s page.
If I deactivate a user. So if I click this deactivate a user, it will deactivate them, but it will not get them off this list, even though you activated them until you refresh the page.
So that&#39;s a small change that we can do so that as soon as I deactivate them, it&#39;ll disappear off the list and it&#39;ll go to the inactive side.
That&#39;s part one of the same task. And part two is understanding that if you have a user like John Dorian, if a John Dorian hat has two affiliations, one is a primary program of creation.
The secondary program creation to surgery. If all of those two, if both of those two programs have inactive affiliation. So John Dorian is, is affiliated with internal medicine and surgery, and both of those affiliations are inactive.
Then his user status will be inactive. If a least one of these is active, then these user status is also active and he can log in.
And if you remember, when from that, the task that you did before, you can see here, this is where you said the primary program.
This is where you set the secondary affiliations. Um, and then you could deactivate them by going to the user&#39;s page and you click deactivate program affiliation.
But the issue is it works great on the program side, but if you&#39;re an institutional administrator, there&#39;s no way to tell here which, which users are active and inactive because, um, institutional portals users page lists out everybody and they all look the same.
So here&#39;s some changes that we can make first is we can, there&#39;s a status user status, um, filter. We want to rename this to, um, stat user status.
And then instead of yes, no, we can do active or inactive. So it should be shown up by default. It should only show the active ones by default, but they can switch into the inactive one.
Then on the, the user itself, we want to show a bootstrap tag under their role that says inactive. If they&#39;re inactive, we should say inactive underneath it.
And, uh, uh, uh, read that bootstrap, uh, badge. And then finally, if I&#39;m viewing their profile or edit, editing their demographics, we can show a bootstrap alert at the top of the saying, this is an inactive user.
Yeah. So changes just to review is first part is on the program portal. When I deactivate a user, it should, um, disappear from the list without having to refresh it from the institutional portal.
When we come to this user&#39;s page, you should have this status filter already there. We&#39;re going to rename that to, um, user status with the yes, being changed to active and no being changed with inactive.
And it should be default to active when they first land on the page. If the user is inactive, we show a bootstrap label underneath it in red that says inactive.
This is only in the, um, institutional portal. Um, Oh, sorry. We can, we can actually show it in both places.
We just call it, say inactive user. And instead of saying, just saying inactive, inactive user, and if, um, they open up their profile or edit demographics, we&#39;ll have a woodshop alert at the top that says this is an inactive user.
So that way everybody knows which users are active and which users are inactive.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e859ac6434a94b149d0624c0322a8790</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Migration</pre></td><td><pre>So for this particular feature, um, we have the ability to migrate a curriculum from one year to the next. And basically what you do is you choose one academic year, check the net, choose the next one.
And you pick out all the things you want to move over and which works fine. The issue comes when it comes, is when with the groups.
So, right right now, when you&#39;re moving courses or sessions over they&#39;ll, they may have a bunch of groups associated with it.
This is user groups and these groups will have students in it. If you move to, uh, if you copy the courses and the sessions over to the next academic year, you may not, you, in many instances, you will not have the same students be in the groups next year.
So right now, all we do is we just copy the links to the same groups into the next year. So instead of doing that, or in addition to doing that, what we want to do is create a redesign here where we structure it a little differently, where you have session schedules and it tells the system, Hey, you want to migrate the session schedules, session leaders, and then session dates, which is fine.
And then it comes, put the groups into a separate section, and then we can let them choose, um, something like this, where it should be a radio button.
I didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t fully finish this yet. Um, but the idea is to let them pick whether they want to keep the same groups that are linked to the courses with the same students.
Okay. And then same groups linked to the sessions with the same people. Shouldn&#39;t be like this one or either, or either that, or create new groups with the same name in the new academic year, empty groups for the courses.
And then I also want to say, once you create these new groups, okay. Uh, new empty groups with the same names, the new academic year and well that&#39;s where the courses and then four sessions, same exact thing.
Um, Two sessions &lt;inaudible&gt; And you can also say &lt;inaudible&gt;. And so th th the idea that I gave here is we&#39;re giving them the option to keep the same groups and link them, um, and keep at the same people in those groups.
Or we&#39;re going to create new groups in, uh, with the same names in the academic year and, um, and linked them.
But those groups will be empty. And then we&#39;ll use the populate groups feature to fill them. Um, and this page itself, it may be beneficial for us to, um, um, update the design a little bit so that we have, um, descriptions of each of these.
So maybe having, um, something, some section at the top that says, uh, objective migration as a panel. And then as you, for each, each of these items, we can have a global objectives will be moved over program objectives will be moved over, um, and then giving that way it&#39;s, it&#39;s telling them what is going to happen.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0573ace15a0842fb94bd35200d4431f4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Backlog | !Design</pre></td><td><pre>So this has to do with usability issues with it, for the Asians and having a design update to make it clear for the users.
So if I go to programs, users, And then Demographics At the top of this section here, we have the photo primary, um, program and then secondary affiliations.
So this is the primary affiliation, the secondary affiliation. There&#39;s also a button to view the log. Um, so it&#39;d be nice if we can redesign this top section so that it&#39;s clearer, um, um, what we&#39;re doing here.
So we&#39;re adding an affiliation than adding additional affiliation. Let me see if I can go into Figma real quick. So Let&#39;s say that&#39;s the top of the page.
Um, maybe we can have a Section at the top with photo here, and then we also want to, um, if I removed right now, there&#39;s not really any way to remove a photo, you can only add it.
So, um, we want to be able to remove that also. Um, and then if I&#39;m, if I don&#39;t have a photo there, let&#39;s go back to another profile.
Yeah. So it has this big a, um, which is fine. And then we want to have a, something clear that says, uh, um, upload a photo for this person right now.
It says change photo, even though it doesn&#39;t have a photo. So having a clear section at the top for Okay.
Um, or we can even have a little description of the button below that that says, uh, um, um, uh, please add a photo for this user there&#39;s, um, having a photo for each user increases the, uh, compliance, uh, for completion or evaluations and other tasks, so that they&#39;re encouraged to do that.
And then on the right side, we want to have two sections. One is primary program alleviation, and then the explanation underneath it says primary program affiliation is the, um, the, the train, the trainee, or this user specialty.
And then below that we can indicate secondary Affiliations And use a multi-select air. &lt;inaudible&gt; Add additional affiliations for other, okay. The trainee or the use it person may or &lt;inaudible&gt; Well, programs will also have access to the user.
So &lt;inaudible&gt;, So we need to just clean up the design a little bit and, and update the, um, section on the right side.
And then this view log of changes and then info updated kind of for last updated by information. We need to put that somewhere.
Um, so maybe we can put &lt;inaudible&gt; Section at the top. Um, &lt;inaudible&gt; Whether you can have the view log of changes and accounting for last updated, Something like that.
I&#39;m just quickly mocking logging this up, but basically cleaning up a design to make it clear what they&#39;re doing here in terms of primary affiliation, secondary affiliations, um, uploading the photo of making each clear that, uh, one, they should upload the photo and two, um, if they&#39;re, uh, if they already have a photo being able to remove it, um, if they already have a photo, we can add a, uh, remove photo button or along with an update for a button.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1273e12930e44216afe7ea560df6c977</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this particular feature, um, when we are in the program admin portal and on the case templates page, we have a, um, diagnosis list here that has a bunch of diagnosis.

So the main page, the main templates page, when you&#39;re clicking manage default, we&#39;ll show out to all of them, but when you&#39;re creating a new template, we want to be able to select a subset of those.

They want the students to track. Um, and the thing is we also want to give for each of those, be able to specify how many of those diagnosis they need to be able to track.
So it&#39;s, um, it&#39;s a little tricky. I think the best thing is to have a table and then being able to click, um, um, add diagnosis and then they can click a bunch of them and add it.

Um, so there for these email notifications that has evaluation information, um, these is, these are, um, it has all the good content, but we just need to update the design.
So for example, think about it from a user perspective, you have an email coming to you. It says survey 20, 21 Mulcair Santos, cherry.
And, um, it doesn&#39;t really make it clear to me. Um, and there&#39;s a big G here for a user that doesn&#39;t give them enough information, um, about what these things are.
So this is, uh, indicating what, um, type of form it is, is this G is for general foreign type. Um, but I don&#39;t know if it really needs normally if there&#39;s a photo, I mean, we&#39;re evaluating somebody else.
Um, it would show, show up here, but if there&#39;s no photo and it&#39;s not an evaluation of somebody else, it just shows, um, G and then this survey texts also appears here for some reason, it&#39;s, I&#39;m assuming this is indicating that this is a survey, but for the sake of, uh, someone that&#39;s getting an email notification, um, what&#39;s more important is, um, having some sort of a labels to indicate what is shown here so we can have, this is the form name.
So a form name, the status is unopened. That&#39;s showing a due date, and then the survey, um, we can call it as maybe like, um, the type, and then that can be a type of, um, as a survey, or we can even leave that out.

So, first thing is when you&#39;re creating a group, you have to add people to that group one by one, which is a very tedious process.
Instead of doing that, what we want to do is sort of redesign this whole process. And when you say new group, um, we can keep all of these things at the same and then have sections at the bottom where you can choose, um, role or select a bunch of individuals or select other groups.
And you&#39;re creating, um, a new group with those things in mind. And I think, uh, some of the, that thing that you created for populate and create groups, it may work.
We may be able to use those, um, designs and just add a way to just create one group without having to put the rules in.
So essentially what we&#39;re trying to do is solve the problem of adding a bunch of students, like 500, 600 students to a group quickly using their roles, um, and letting them build that initial roster.
So that was also going to require a little checkbox that designated as a roster group. And so there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ae466864db8648f68714341ad81ff62a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>So this is the new mock-up that are made based on, um, the sample work, our logging options here. So it should be the same functionality.
I just laid it out differently to try to make it simpler for some of the administrators that are setting this up.
So first option here, it says any program not selected, it is not, will not be required to log hours. I just made that into a, uh, radio button here so that it says trainees are only required to log hours of the program enrolled, uh, selected below, um, trainees are required to log hours all year long by default.
However, if the program is so, uh, set below, then they will only have to log out during those selected big ranges.
So hopefully that should be the same thing. I tried to just explain it in a longer sentence, so that it&#39;s clear.
And then next section is asking them, do you sample work hours from all programs during the sampling period? And then here&#39;s going to be, yes, all programs use the same sampling date ranges.
So here, when that protect this one, this would appear. And otherwise, if I click, no, then I hear this option.
So both of them shouldn&#39;t be visible at the same time. I&#39;m just showing it for design purposes. So if I choose this, I get the option to select programs, roles.
Then I can add sampling periods. That&#39;s going to be the same for all of these down here. If I say, no, we need to specify separate sampling date ranges for different programs.
Then I can specify the start date and end date along with the program, like role so that I can be more specific and have all different date ranges.
And then after that is, do you want to allow programs to customize the sampling period? Yes. No. If it&#39;s, yes.
Then they&#39;ll be able to change that from the program portal and no, otherwise it would not appear on the program portal for as editable.
And the other thing that we need to tweak as, uh, and they have lots of programs, just making sure that it wraps.
So it doesn&#39;t, um, uh, it&#39;s easier to find something, so I&#39;ll probably need to make some more tweaks to the actual table.
But the key thing I wanted feedback on is whether this sort of format will work where we can do a yes, no.
And then yes, no to specify, specify the sample periods as one sampling period for all of the selective programs, or then customize it based on each program.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f2ff035e365f4718851c68a13ced0201</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Schedule Pain Points</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the first frustrations they coordinators have with the schedules. So schedules are something that is created by the coordinator, um, or maintained by the coordinator and a chief resident.
The chief resident is typically a senior resident in the program that has a responsibility of helping out with the schedules.
But since we&#39;re talking strictly to the coordinators, we&#39;ll just ignore chief residents from this conversation. And, um, focusing on the three types of scheduling that the coordinators do first is their work rotation schedule, which some people refer to as a master or block scheduling that it requires assignments over two to four weeks in different areas of their hospital.
So if you&#39;re in an internal medicine program, you may spend four weeks in the ICU, four weeks in the outpatient clinics, uh, four weeks in the inpatient rotations.
So those are the different rotation schedules. Then there is a call schedules, call schedules are, um, when you&#39;re being put on call, that&#39;s covering the hospital after hours and weekends.
So 5:00 PM onwards till 7:00 AM in the morning is going to be specific one or two individuals that are covering those call hours.
So they have to maintain a schedule for each of their services that have after hour serve, uh, patient care and then create a daily schedule for those calls.
And the last part is the lecture schedules, since there are, these residents are in training every day, once or twice a day, they have a scheduled lectures from the faculty members.
So all three of these schedules are maintained by the coordinator and the front &lt;inaudible&gt; is one, the two pieces, one is a lot of little information has to be loaded to the system.
And if it takes a lot of clicks to do that, that takes a lot of effort from the coordinators. But more of a challenge for these coordinators is when something changes.
So let&#39;s say they created a schedule and have everything perfect. As soon as you make that schedule, it&#39;s automatically outdated because somebody will want to take a time off or somebody who wants to put our recreation requests.
And then you had to make changes on the schedule to account for that. So if you have a resident that&#39;s going to be out for a week, then you had just swapped them, somebody else, and then make a lot of changes.
So if you don&#39;t maintain a efficient system for this, when you make the changes and the residents and faculty, I, the members are not aware of the changes and that can lead to frustration.
Yeah. Because somebody may not show up for work. Um, the other thing is this information on the schedule is tied to the government reimbursement for the hospital, most training programs in the United States, money from center for Medicare and Medicaid CMS to fund their programs.
So the resident salaries and all that coming from the government, the federal government. So in order for them to get paid, they have to show detailed records of all of the schedules that the residents, uh, provide all the, all the patient care that the patient, the resident provided.
So this is down to the daily breakdown. So what days that they worked on each of the different, um, uh, shifts or different rotations, and if the schedule is not maintained, or if there&#39;s an inaccurate information on it, the entire request from that institution can get rejected.
And that can be a delay of millions of dollars at the hospital can get, oftentimes it doesn&#39;t get to that point, but it&#39;s usually the finance department that gets, um, catches his mistakes and sends it back to the coordinators to fix.
So metrics make stop, um, process pretty easy. One, we make it easy to enter the schedule. And two, we also have the same checks, data checks that the finance department or third-party auditors would do.
So coordinators can make sure the schedule information is accurate before they submit it to the Finance departments.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/904eb296ab8d4235b39a31c6d8d933af</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So looking at these, uh, ones that we&#39;re missing, when, uh, we create an event, we send out the invitation.
So if you go to the program admin portal, we also want, we want to test this one on the institutional portal, as well as a program admin portal, to make sure that it works in both, both the calendars.
So if you click in here, create an event, just fill out all the fields. So we capture everything. And then when you click save, Well, that didn&#39;t ask me.
Um, so you have to create and then choose at least one person. And then it&#39;ll ask you whether you want to send, send out those invitations.
So if you do this, you will send that invite and you can set tested in that a male hog server to see what it looks like.
I would just make sure to include, um, all of the fields and, uh, um, including venue and a description, a few, some copy and paste texts in there to make sure we see all of it, including an attachment.
Then for this one, this is supposed to be a designed for the reports that we sent out from the system.
So there are multiple reports that we potentially email. So we got to check the institutional portal and the program portal and the way that, um, well, one of the easiest ones to check is the evaluation summary report.
If you select the criteria, there is a option to email the report to me. So you can check this one and if it&#39;s, uh, um, broken, then we, sorry, not broken.
If it&#39;s not updated, then maybe the other ones are not updated either. Um, so once you check this, you can check, um, schedule export report, for example, and see if that one works.
And there&#39;s a few other ones that we&#39;ll have a little check box to have it emailed to them. Chris may have a list of them, but, um, safest thing to do is just open it up and see if there&#39;s a little chat box for, um, having them emailed.
You can probably just hold down the command button and open up a bunch of tabs so that you can easily switch between them and just confirm.
So that&#39;s the second one. Um, this one is Login as Perry Cox and, uh, sorry, John Dorian, and put in a vacation request by going to benefits page and in the system set up under settings, there is a setting for this.
And so you can turn this on, on the issue server so that it&#39;s email notifications are going to Perry Cox and the notifications are turned on, then have John Dorian or any other user submit a request.
And that&#39;s your send an email to Perry Cox to have a review of that. And then when they&#39;re reviewing it, they can approve it or reject it.
And that will also trigger an email to John Dorian. The key thing here is it has to be submitted by a user that has a primary program F internal medicine.
So you, the best is to use somebody like Alec Korab here and submit the request. It will send an email to Perry Cox to review it, and then he can come into the system to approve it or reject it.
And that will trigger an email. I would check the approve and the reject one to make sure that&#39;s updated. So there&#39;s three emails that are associated with benefits.
One is when the request comes in and the administrator will see that the request was made, then there&#39;s the approval one.
And then there&#39;s a rejection one. This email Is, uh, we can put this into the merger quest to make sure that it gets updated, um, to the new format.
Okay. It would actually be nice if we can put a little, um, um, icon next to it to indicate what type of file it is, um, the same way we have it in the resources folder.
So in the resources folder, we indicate whether it&#39;s a PDF or a website, and if we can use the same icon in the email, uh, that&#39;d be ideal.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/33c9ac7e42b8473cb5dec2b85ada19c5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>&lt;inaudible&gt; We won&#39;t get into the bottom ones yet.

All right. So, so I, um, I would say, you know, we, you know, this is something that is purely a, uh, technical, uh, timeline that we would have to come up with because we just, you know, we, we, we would just have to look at the data and seeing what would it break in terms of the AMC reporting and how do we get around it and build it in a way that maybe is likely going to, we can do it as a setting that gets turned on for each school that wants to do that and that, and then, uh, leave the things as it is.
But if you want to do it, then it&#39;ll be, um, so is that something that, where would that fit in into the plan?
Yeah, I would, I would put it not in the first one, mainly because if there&#39;s optimization and stuff that needs to be done.
Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So it is something that we can look into. And I mean, if we, now that we know what the idea is, like how it would work, um, I&#39;ll talk to, uh, our team to see, um, what it&#39;s gonna take and if there&#39;s, if it comes up, like, if there&#39;s a development, like, uh, you know, some free time we&#39;ll do it before then, but for the official thing, let&#39;s put it for that, that one there, and we can, we can do it.
Yep. Which one, which, okay. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, for, um, the other project that we&#39;re doing, the key words, um, what, when is that deadline on that one on the, it&#39;s already handed off to develop they&#39;re working on, I just want to know, um, for that.
Okay. All right. That&#39;s fine. I, uh, we should be able to do it by then. I just wanted to know, have a date so that I can give it to the developers to know that they have a specific timeline.

So if this is turned on, and if I go to the rotations, we have rotation resources, uh, which I can click on.
And it takes me to a folder where I have a bunch of files and hyperlinks. So we want to make sure we have hot files and hyperlinks.
And when We Have that rotation assigned to this resident. So if I go to cardiology, for example, has a hyperlink and a file.
And if I go to the schedule And to go to Here, so today&#39;s the 30th. Yeah. Let&#39;s see 30th. And then, so if I put cardiology, so seven days from now, so eight, Sorry.
I think that should be seven days from now cardiology and then publish. So that&#39;s one and then four requirements that are overdue.
So let&#39;s check somebody over. Do you &lt;inaudible&gt; So it looks like there may be a bug on this where it&#39;s not getting status of overview and that&#39;s probably the why we are not getting those emails to go out, actually.
I&#39;m sorry. So for the second email where we have it as incomplete, uh, anything that is pending for that user should go out.
So it on Dorian Filter and then John Dorian has, uh, several of these that are incomplete. Um, those should be included in the email.
So let&#39;s re try generating an email. I can go to the sandbox And curriculum distribution from that, and then resident daily summary on that, and then go to email to debug &lt;inaudible&gt;.
Okay. So we need to find &lt;inaudible&gt;. So here overdo evaluations. So you can see that John Dorian has that &lt;inaudible&gt;. So when you generate the email dude for hello, Joe social, hello, John.
And that will allow you to find John Dorian&#39;s email. And he has you requirements pending an overdue requirements as for the curriculum.

So this is a usability issue that we came across today, where if we have a course evaluation that&#39;s created, and then down here, we can schedule, select a bunch of courses and then choose the rules for assignment.
So we either add it as assignment rule like this versus after a certain number of days before the end of the course, or I can choose specific dates and then add that to the, Um, I bet to the assignment rule.
So when this happens, we are supposed to make those assignments on March 25th. Um, but we have a, uh, secondary check, but it&#39;s done to see if the assignment should happen.
That&#39;s the activation date. So I can put this activation date for today. And technically I should put this where yesterday, um, uh, I put this for tip yesterday, then the client will think that is activation.
May assignment may happen on the 25th. But one thing that we also check is is whether or not the activation date is before the start date of any course that we have selected here.
So if the course start date is on or after the activation date,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c91affcf0154470098bd6d59a5828d4b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>ACGME - Accreditation Data System (ADS)</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to look up a residency program at the web ads website.
And then also seeing if we have ever contacted that institution before. So this web IDs is a public facing site that lists out all the residency programs and their sponsoring institutions in the United States.
So there are a few useful reports in here that lets you find out information about the specific program. So some of the useful ones are the newly accredited programs, uh, newly accredited sponsors list of any programs that are on, um, that are received.
Any citations. I think there&#39;s one of those like that here. Um, so that&#39;s this one accreditation decisions by program. Um, but for this part of the outreach, the best thing to do is go to program search.
And then at the top, just choose one of the West coast, uh, um, States such as let&#39;s say wa Washington, then click search.
And it&#39;ll give you all of the different programs that are there in, in Washington. And for the sake of this particular outreach, we want us to focus on the residency programs and, uh, not necessarily go into the fellowships, the fellowship programs have, you know, a handful of fellows like one or two, and they&#39;re not necessarily going to be making a decision to switch their software independently cause they usually follow the residency programs.
So, so let&#39;s say if I go into, I lot pick out a few of the ones that are good anesthesiology is a larger residency program.
Um, but emergency medicine, internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, those are the larger ones. And I&#39;ll post a list in that notion card so that we can target those first.
So let&#39;s start with, let&#39;s say family medicine. So now if I click search again, you have all the family medicine programs in Washington, and then I can hover over one of these and click view program.
Yeah. And then this is at MultiCare, good Samaritan hospital, scroll down. This is the program director. This is the program coordinator.
That&#39;s the person that we&#39;re going to be going after. So one of the first things that we can do is, uh, just look up this institution in our directory to see if we have contacted them before.
So we&#39;ll just look up MultiCare MultiCare. So let&#39;s look up this coordinator, Nothing. So it looks like this person we&#39;ve never contacted this person.
And if I scroll down, I can show you, this is the size of the program. There&#39;s 18 residents in this program.
And then if I go into, Um, Let&#39;s see, &lt;inaudible&gt;, I&#39;m trying to go to the, um, the pro uh, institutional page.
Um, so what you can do is here, this is what I&#39;m looking for, sponsoring institution. So if I just opened this up in a new tab, this will let me see all the other programs that are in that institutions.
It looks like they have two family medicine programs and addiction medicine. So this is a good one for us to contact both of these programs because they are both family medicine and as a small institution and in order to contact them, the first thing we want to do is a little bit of research.
So you can use, if they have their website up here, we can go straight to their website, then go to the FM residency program and actually click around a little bit &lt;inaudible&gt; So it looks like they have their faculty and everybody listed on their website.
They have, um, medical students rotating there too. So that&#39;s another talking points, um, that may be helpful, uh, whether or not they have different visiting students and residents that are coming there and being able to schedule them.
But so if there&#39;s anything useful here, it&#39;s, it&#39;s good to have it on the website, uh, the website up when we&#39;re calling.
Um, but anyway, so I go back to here and the main person that I would want to contact is on the residency program and the coordinator, their phone number is usually listed here.
If not, you can look it up on their website and then on a spreadsheet, um, we want to make, make a list of the institution that we contacted, um, the name of the institution, the person that we contacted, their phone number, their email, their website, if they have it and the, the, the program that they are with and the date that we contacted them.
So I&#39;ll set up a template for that, um, that we can use. So once we reach out to them, we make the note and then move on to the next one.
And I&#39;ll go into the talking points that in the next video, but the two main websites are the ACG Amy&#39;s web ads and the clothes that IO.
And then from the ads website, you can get to the residency programs website to do any sort of preliminary research.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/685b6998ff3d46e3a43740bfc9e733b0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Follow-up from &quot;Draft: Resolve &quot;Bug - Assignments Page - Require activities&quot;&quot; (#2616) · Issues · Medtrics Lab / Medtrics · GitLab</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike.

Cause we loaded the KP database to it. So it&#39;s admin to metric lab and the password for KP. And then once you get in there, what you can do is add the word M H dash in front of it, and it allows you to get into the mail server.
So then if you run the different scripts allows you to generate some of those emails. Um, but if you look here, you can see a sample of these and, um, there are some issues with it.
So it&#39;s definitely a lot better than before. Um, but I think the font spacing and stuff, it needs some work.
Um, so for example, uh, I think that instead of the form name and then the text here, we can actually just show the name of the former and bold, Or maybe this is fine, but I just need to adjust the spacing.
But anyway, so this is how you would test it. There&#39;s we had to test each of the different emails that we have.
Um, so this is just one of the summary emails and we need to create some fake data and run it to make sure that we have enough or all of the different tests that we have to do.
Yeah, definitely a lot better than it used to. We also need to make sure that links all work No, it was just so nice.
Yeah. So we please take a look at it when you have a chance and then we&#39;ll get it out. Um, so there&#39;s some minor issues of, for example, this is black font.
This is dark gray font.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d490cd7761e84eebbb8c66ac2859ad7b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>User Affiliations</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at users and affiliations. So right now I am logged in as the super admin, which is admin and metrics, lab.com.
This is a user account that is only accessible to metrics employees and allows us to get into the system and do certain configuration that institutions need before they get started.
So if you click on the logo at the top, this will bring up the company menu. And again, this is only something that should be accessed access by the metrics team, but on the left side, you have the regular system menu.
So if I go to users, this would show me all of the users in the system. You can see at the top that I&#39;m currently in the program portal.
Um, but since I am a super admin right now, it, it lets me see all the users in the institution.
So to skip over to the, what the clients are using login as our favorite administrator Perry, Cox Perry here has access to the institution program and personal portal.
So all metrics users have the ability to use the personal portal, which is their basic functionality. If they&#39;re given administrative access to the program, then they have access to the program administration portal.
Remember that metrics can have multiple programs in the system. So if I go to the program portal, I&#39;m able to toggle between the different programs that I have administrative privileges to.
And then on top of that, they have the institutional portal. This is for the institutional leadership going to the user&#39;s page.
Here&#39;s where I can work with different users, either from the institutional portal or from the program side, institutional users will have access to all the, all the users program.
Administrators will have access to the programs that are affiliated with that pro with their program. So that leads us to what our affiliations.
So affiliations are a way for a user to be linked to different programs. And when a user account is created, whether it be faculty, staff, resident, or student at the top, you have the ability to set a primary program.
Um, that would be what this person is, uh, uh, training as, or their specialty that their medical specialty and or whatever department they&#39;re part of.
So this faculty, maybe a member of the internal medicine department, and then you can go and add additional affiliation to other departments or programs.
And what that means is a user has a status of active or inactive. And in addition to that, you have affiliations to different programs and those affiliations can have a status of active or inactive.
So when I click on this endocrinology, I&#39;m creating an active affiliation with the endocrinology program and that&#39;s made when I click safe.
So let&#39;s pretend like we made that one. I go back to the user&#39;s page and if I open up one of our users here and go to their profile, I can see that this person has programmed.
This is their primary program. And then all of our secondary affiliations listed out here, the primary programs affiliation has also shown them the affiliation section.
And it also shows you recover over it when that person had the affiliation made and who made the affiliation. All right, now let&#39;s pretend like this person, one of the users have graduated and they&#39;re, um, leaving the training program in that scenario.
Um, I switched it to the program side. I can go in there and deactivate the program affiliation. So if I deactivate the program affiliation, first thing metrics does is to check to see if they&#39;re on any schedules, um, or there&#39;s an appending evaluations.
If so, we will prevent them from being deactivated. But if they don&#39;t, then we&#39;ll go ahead and deactivate them and deactivate.
And the affiliation does not remove that user from this program. Um, we can always switch into the inactive tab and inactive a filter and see all the people that are inactive.
If you ever want to reactivate that you click this button and it&#39;ll reactivate the affiliation and let&#39;s go ahead and open up the user.
If I go in here on check it and save it, then that will actually delete that affiliation from this user&#39;s account.
All right. So we went over the, um, users and how they&#39;re created and how they&#39;re affiliated to different programs as primary affiliation or secondary.
There&#39;s also a way for program level administrators to affiliate people from other programs into theirs. So let&#39;s say I am an internal medicine program, and I have a resident that is coming to my department to work for three months, uh, from the pediatrics department, when I&#39;m ready to put them on the schedule, I can just go to affiliated people with program search for that resident and then just affiliate them with my program.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b6f9fdb2b71b405a882683ca2a26a868</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Loom Recording 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Lily for, uh, this project, uh, we needed your help to, uh, enter some evaluations into our demo database.

So I wanted to use this video to give some introductory information about our company. So we&#39;ll start, we&#39;ll start on our website.
And so in this particular calls that you&#39;re going to be doing, you&#39;ll be calling hospitals and trying to reach their coordinator or director for medical education.
So metric metrics is a software platform that is Academic institutions, academic hospitals, that offer graduate medical education programs. So it&#39;s just commonly referred to as GME graduate medical education in the United States is, is included.
It&#39;s inclusive of, um, residency and fellowship programs. So in order to become a doctor, a student who would go to regular college fall or four years of bachelor&#39;s degree, and then go into medical school for four years.
And after they graduated from medical school, they would go to a residency program and then a fellowship program to learn how to practice medicines.
These programs are offered by at different hospitals and each type of doctor has a different residency program. So I can go to a, uh, let&#39;s say a general surgery, Excellent Presidency program.
I can become a surgeon. I can go to a family medicine And become a family practitioner. Okay. We&#39;re going to be reaching out to these organizations that have one or more of these different training programs.
So our primary objective is to reach the institutional So institutional leaders, there&#39;s a couple of different titles that you can, uh, familiar with.
The director is Dio, which stands for designated fusional official. So they always call it the IO. Um, so we don&#39;t need, this is just for your own reference, what the stands for, but on the call, if they mentioned bio that&#39;s a decision, the director And they&#39;re, they have, they usually have, uh, coordinators that work directly under them that, that manage all of their operations.
So that is GME coordinator and these are CIO and are usually Going to be the one answers calls. So when we reach out to these, uh, institutional leaders, they&#39;re going to have specific, uh, things that they&#39;re interested in.
And our goal is to, um, you know, learn a little bit about them and sort of ask if they&#39;re using, introduce yourself, Do your standard, uh, call, uh, you know, introductory conversation.
And then for metrics, the key things is, um, talking about, uh, them as like asking if they use a electronic RMS is a short for it.
And almost every program that we call we&#39;ll be using one. And then the idea would be to talk about specific pain points and seeing if they will be open to seeing another, uh, more modern residency management system like metrics.
And, um, In some of the documents that David put together, he has, um, more details and personas about each of the, um, Um, Different types of individuals.
So for example, I&#39;ll copy and paste this onto the Google doc. Um, this is for This is the same institutional coordinator would just the same as GMA coordinator.
I want to also go over some buzzwords &lt;inaudible&gt; man.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a0550d3c746b435fbfc1b45ccd1ed2b3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Completing Evaluations | Articles | Medtrics | Intercom</pre></td><td><pre>So this is a article that, um, sort of overlaps with the one that I made in this video. How do we initiate, um, evaluations for residents?
So I talked about creating an article for how to complete evaluations, and I think it looks like this is the article that we have for it.
So we can first rename this into there at a how to title format, so how to complete, um, evaluations. And then, um, having a introductory section that says, um, evaluations are assigned to you from your program and they should be completed on a timely manner and explaining that their email notifications that you receive from metrics, um, with links to complete them, it is important for you to make sure that he receiving those emails.
And if, if completed them promptly, uh, based on those, uh, uh, deadlines and here can goes into the dashboard. So I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s necessary to have, um, these like smaller screenshots.
It&#39;s better to have one screenshot where you can highlight the section because most people will need to know where the, where the item is on the page.
So if you take a screenshot off the dashboard on the program, on the faculty portal and then put one for the middle section and the two for the evaluations, that&#39;d be easier.
And then, um, so my evaluations, when you look at it, um, it is something that we don&#39;t want to start the article talking about what was completed on me.
If the topic is about how to complete evaluations, you want to start off with talking about the, to do section and where it&#39;s going to go over the complete, complete, uh, complete assigned evaluations.
And we all bleed the screenshot because this was updated to have a button here for are unable to assess. I&#39;m going to explain that on this page, you will see all the evaluations that were assigned to them and any open evaluations that they started will be visible here, open evaluations that they started, they can delete if they don&#39;t want to complete it anymore, but if it&#39;s something that was assigned to them, uh, the option is for them to either completed or Mark it as unable to assess.
If they&#39;re unable to assess, they&#39;ll be asked to put a reason why, and they can submit it. And on the next page, you can see a screenshot of what it looks like, but again, he&#39;s on the screenshot or you&#39;re taking a specific piece of that form and showing it rather than doing that as better to show the full form and see what it looks like or that top part so that they can see it in context of what&#39;s on the screen.
And then at the bottom, um, when we really need to see screenshots of save draft and submit, you can just explain it, they&#39;ll understand what that means.
So we have a section on completing assigned evaluations and we&#39;ll show how to do that, how to do the, uh, unable to assess.
And it&#39;s also useful to show the header. So let me go to, &lt;inaudible&gt;, Uh, taking a screenshot of this top section here, and we can say that when you, um, have an evaluation that you&#39;re completing, I&#39;ll take this as a sample.
You have the header that gives them some valuable information. So for example, Um, this header will allow them to, um, see that this is a confidential form.
That means that when they submit something, their name, role, and identifying information is hidden from the person that they evaluated.
It also tells them what kind of form it is, whether it&#39;s a program evaluation or a rotation evaluation. And so on the assigned date, when it&#39;s due and also have an option to submit us unable to assess here, um, on the top, right?
Do you have a way to switch between the questions and then for competency analysis, they can open and collapsed these?
Uh, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s this really needed to sell on there, but if you can, if you want to.
So we go through the, um, explanation on how to complete it. And then we also want to cover on this article, how to view completed evaluations.
So that&#39;s what was covered up here. We can put that at the bottom saying, um, there&#39;s this the next tab to show us the completed page and show the screenshot of that.
And you can show that anything that I have completed on somebody else, or a course or rotation will show up in the completed tab.
And then the last section is the about me, which will show all the evaluations that were completed by somebody else about me.
Um, so that&#39;s the entire complete evaluations format. And then for some reason, we also have the, uh, open evaluations down here.
Um, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to, um, I guess we can have it as a section, but I feel like it&#39;s better for us to have a separate article.
That&#39;s saying how you would complete, um, how do we mention ad hoc or open creation, have this content in there and then have a section where we&#39;re linking it to that article and then, um, had the link go there if they need to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3537148c46ed4478bffbef596fea8c60</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the work hours feature in the residents module. So our key things that we want to highlight here, one is the, um, when they sh when they log hours, they can only be logging hours.
When the schedule has been published. If they&#39;re trying to log hours to four a day where there&#39;s no published schedule, uh, this is the block schedule.
They will not be able to, um, log hours and they will receive an error. I&#39;ve actually copied that error message here.
It&#39;ll, it&#39;ll say you&#39;re not on any metrics schedules for today. Please contact your administrator. So that&#39;s a common thing that happens.
We want to address in the documentation. So assuming they have the hours, uh, I mean the schedule already published, then they can enter the hours in a few different ways.
One is they can, um, drag and drop these shifts that are available at the top. So we want to explain to the shifts at the top or the ones that are made available for them to use.
They have the ability to drag and drop and then adjust the hours as needed. In this particular example, I&#39;m actually doing a incorrect, uh, thing here, because at the top you can see, we do show the vacation time.
If they&#39;re on time off, any, anything that&#39;s approved and approved time off requests it&#39;ll appear on the work hours page.
So they don&#39;t have to log any hours on those days. So we want to emphasize that in the documentation, they should only be logging hours on days that they don&#39;t, uh, they&#39;re actually working and not on any days that they&#39;re off.
So if they&#39;re on vacation, just leave it blank. Um, they can start logging on the days that they&#39;re working and once they drag and drop, they can adjust the start time and end time by dragging up and down, or if they want, you can just click on it and edit the hours in this window.
Any, just anywhere on this page, you just click into it. It&#39;ll bring up this window to edit, which allows you to select the start time and end time as well as a shift type.
And you can even copy the last shift over and this, um, repeat functionality is also very important to highlight because a lot of users don&#39;t see it.
If you click that, what, and just keep copying the same shift over and over for one day to the next and the, um, anything that is logged overnight.
We can say that they can low drag the hours down and continue into the next day as one shift. They should not break it up as two separate shifts.
It should be one entry that goes from one day to the next. Yeah, After they have logged the hours, um, every resident should finalize the hours when they click finalize, It&#39;ll bring up a window.
Well, looks like we have a bug. And, um, I should let you finalize the hours. And, uh, on this window, it will show a list of all the days that they left blank.
So if they have vacation or they have an entry, then it&#39;s okay. It won&#39;t show up on there. But if they left a day blank like Sunday here, Or One of these days in between, if they left a blank, when they finalize it, it&#39;ll bring those up and ask them to confirm that they were off.
Um, if they&#39;re not off, then they will come to, um, that specific day and they will have to go and add an entry for that day.
Um, we also want to emphasize that there is a mobile view, click inspect element, and go to the, uh, what we&#39;ll do.
We can see here that this looks a little different. And when they click add shift, it brings up this window, uh, where they can select a start time and end time.
We don&#39;t necessarily have to show the screenshot because eventually we&#39;ll be replacing it with that same window as the one that we have on the desktop.
But we also have the repeat functionality here where they can copy from one day to the next. So That&#39;s everything about logging hours and then for violations, uh, as soon as the violation is generated, they&#39;re notified of that in the violations tab.
And here it allows them to see the problem and then click justify and write a description of what happened, um, why they have to have that violation.
And then Last thing here on the home screen, They have, uh, A section here for seeing all the violations that were recently generated that they can review and write notes about it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/33c106fec1464a9ca915c38358a9a2d8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>All Messages | Medtrics | Intercom - 19 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, so I made a copy of the template and made this so that we&#39;re only highlighting this schedules page.
Let&#39;s send this out. To the uhm. GME people and that that will be the only thing that we have on there, because I think this is a big enough feature that we don&#39;t want people to miss it.
Uhm? And at the bottom. It says, uhm? We&#39;re excluding. I don&#39;t. I didn&#39;t set this up. I think what you did was better.
You can pick out the GME. GME institutions and then send it specifically for them and we can. Select. Anyone, uhm.
That is active for that. And I can help review that uhm. I think we can also. So the way that I prepared this is I took the transcript from my video and I set it to prepare product marketing email to announce the new feature and then it.
It gave me this and I tweaked it. So yeah, I think it&#39;s best for us to send this as a standalone and then we&#39;ll worry about the podcast promotions later.
This is a more important thing for us to promote. Because it&#39;s an actual functionality that a lot of people in GME wanted.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/61dc0452b4f942b1b1f6e8a727506e63</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Schedule - List - 15 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at our schedules page which is built for our hospital clients. This is made specifically to centralize all of your clinical schedules in one view.
By clicking that green schedules link on the top right of your metrics account, you&#39;ll be taken to this new page and there are two ways to view this information.
One is the list view as we have it here. And on this page, I can filter for different dates and see who&#39;s covering that day.
By default, it&#39;ll take you to today&#39;s date and you can say my schedule and it&#39;ll show you your schedule for that day.
You can also see other programs in your hospital and who&#39;s covering for different shifts in that department. There&#39;s also a way to search for specific individuals and see their schedule.
So let&#39;s go to internal medicine here and we can see at the bottom that Tony Stark is off on a vacation.
Bruce Banner is on the cardiology rotation and then Blake Johnson is also on the AM clinic with Bruce Banner. So this information is coming from our block schedules, shift schedules and from our time off tool.
So essentially bringing all that together for easy visibility, for easy access to anyone that needs real-time information on who&#39;s covering certain shift or who&#39;s off.
This information can also be exported into an Excel file by clicking this button at the top right. Let&#39;s say we want to see information for multiple days.
We would toggle over to the timeline view, which you can access by clicking the timeline button at the top right.
From here, I can choose a date range. Once I choose a date range, I&#39;ll see all of the shifts and assignments at the bottom.
Here, I can also filter for different programs, people, or even search for specific shifts. So, let&#39;s say I want to search for emergency medicine.
It&#39;ll show me just the emergency medicine shifts. And I can also scroll towards the right side if I need to see a longer time frame.
You can scroll to the right and see more details. Another key thing to note about this page is that you can bookmark it.
If you set up a filter here and say I want to keep track of a specific rotation. So if I say urgent care, I click on it, I go to the emergency urgent care page and if I bookmark this page, anytime I come back to this, I will see the urgent care rotation preselected.
This is helpful if you are always tracking a specific clinical rotation or shift and want to come back to that page.
Then once you get to that page, you can always adjust the dates to see different availabilities different coverages by residents, fellows or attendings.
This page also allows you to export this information into a spreadsheet by clicking the Excel button at the top right.
Then finally, by clicking the My Schedule page, it&#39;ll show you your schedule for that day range.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/153c01aae15544e99aed8cc41baf5df3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kanban Board - Agile board - Jira - 12 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Alejandra, so this is a dashboard that the developers are going to use going forward and I wanted your help with Updating it once a day So that the devs have it ready for the next day so essentially What we want to do is once a day we can sort this by status and then confirm that we have same issues
in here Code review, uhm what issues are in code review, updating that here, then what&#39;s in QA2, updating the statuses here, needs changes.
So first step is to review and update the statuses. Second step is to add any new items that was added to the board.
And then we can also look at anything that&#39;s highlighted in yellow that&#39;s called flagged. If it&#39;s flagged, we also want to mark it as critical in here.
Critical. So three steps. One, confirm the statuses of the ones that&#39;s on there. Two, add any new items and then update any flagged.
And each day the developers will use this in the morning in their 9.30 meeting and they&#39;re going to fill out these.
Three columns. So that way we&#39;re essentially keeping that this document in sync.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/149683f88f4b4c258f7a85377377e25c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSU Intro</pre></td><td><pre>Nice to meet you. Thank you, Stephanie. Hi, Katie. As you mentioned, we already met. So welcome to the team. I don&#39;t think you met Brittany.
Probably not. Hi, I&#39;m Brittany. I am part of the IT team here. I work. on a lot of the integrations, planning them, getting things up and running so that osteopathic medicine processes run a little smoother with a little less manual work hopefully.
Thank you. Erin. Hi, I&#39;m Erin Milliken. I&#39;m the lead Clerkship Resource Specialist. So I supervise our Clerkship Resource Specialist which do scheduling and evaluations like Amy said.
And really assist with just kind of the developments of clerkship related metric functions, how we can improve things, things that we need to adjust and tweak.
So yeah, welcome. And Brad, I think we met at the training session, um, Brad and Kim. Going down the list.
Shannon, you&#39;re next on the list. Hi, I&#39;m Shannon Grochowski-Freeze. I am a curriculum assistant. With the College of Osteomedicine in Family Medicine and Pediatrics.
Thank you. And Richard. Hello, I&#39;m Richard Kalil. I&#39;m the manager of the IT department. I&#39;m IT team that&#39;s doing the integration.
So Brittany is on my team and also Monica who&#39;s not here also does a lot of work in those integrations.
So thank you. Welcome. And Shellyann. Hi, I&#39;m Shelly and I work in the Com Registrar. So I think I&#39;m a floater to these meetings, but that&#39;s it&#39;s nice to learn a lot.
Thank you. And um, Dr. Enright. Hi, Katie, Susan Enright. I&#39;m the Associate Dean for Clerkship. Nice to meet you. And Dr.
Warlow. Hi there, I&#39;m Kirsten Warlow. I&#39;m Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education. It&#39;s nice to meet you, Katie. You are with a great group of people here.
I mean, on your team. We&#39;re a great group I think we&#39;re in a great group of people. I really enjoy these meetings and the collaboration that we have with MSU and one of the things that Katie and I work together on is kind of centralizing the tracking of the different projects.
There&#39;s a set of work. that we&#39;re doing with the pre-clerkship and clerkship and having that tracked centrally through Katie and a couple team members that she&#39;s working with so that there&#39;s better coordination of um these projects and I think Katie has started working with a couple of onboarding projects
but she&#39;s we&#39;re also integrating her into clients that have already been using the system but have more collaborative relationships with us so that those projects are also being tracked under the onboarding uh platform that we&#39;re implementing um so today uh Stephanie you had a shared a document um but
I think then the main new agenda item was the evaluations getting released um so students requesting an evaluation and it going out too soon because students are going at the beginning of the rotation requesting an evaluation um so that is something that um we don&#39;t have a way to.
to prevent that right now but I&#39;ve been thinking about it and I spoke to Chris about it also see what we can do.
Um one thing that we were considering was adding a check on the student side so that when they go to their dad&#39;s funeral.
and and put in the request for all current rotation in the future. Um we can a you to define x number of days from the end of that rotation.
And then they would only be allowed to see that rotation in that drop down if it&#39;s within that time frame.
So they won&#39;t be able to request. So let&#39;s say you put in seven days from the end of the rotation.
If they go into the thing, a system at the beginning of the rotation, they won&#39;t see it listed. But if they go seven days before the end of the rotation, they&#39;ll see it listed and they will be able to submit that request.
I feel like that would prevent this from happening, um, students will likely need some training and education. So why am I not seeing my current rotations, because they may ask you that, um.
Let me know what your thoughts are, if that will, that will uh. solve this problem. So just a quick comment.
So I know when, um, when we, um, originally had spoken, you know, I know we were working through.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0868df809bdc4edea7ad72261964e6e1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>24.01.17 Quarterly Investor Report Highlights - Google Docs - 13 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So this is going to be an investor update. I&#39;m going to be reviewing highlights. From a product standpoint, this year we expand it on what we did with our optimizer service.
And the optimizer service allows medical schools and and I mean veterinary schools to generate schedules for their students. Automatically using a very complex algorithm.
And last year we performed this for one school. This year we expanded this to two additional schools. So we have three veterinary schools now, Ross, University School of Medicine, sorry, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, Purdue School of Veterinary Medicine, and Lincoln Memorial University
School of Veterinary Medicine. And we successfully automated the generation of their schedules. And they&#39;re also using all of our other modules for their clinical students.
This was a huge milestone for us because optimizer capabilities are something that is very uhm cutting edge and is not offered by many companies in the market.
Another big product milestone is that last year we generate the MSPE for two medical schools. MSPE is also another major module that we offer.
This year we expanded that. So we now have Ross University, American University of the Caribbean, St. James, and Michigan University, Michigan State University&#39;s College of Medicine using our MSPE for eModule to automatically generate their MSPE letters for medical students.
We also released our first AI module this year in 2023 with integration of AI tool for automatically mapping medical school curriculum.
This was a big product release for the AAMC conference that we had in Seattle. And it allows medical school to map their curriculum in a fraction of the time than doing it manually.
So those are all the product updates. In terms of onboarding, our biggest onboarding project that we started last year was for Chamberlain University BSN Nursing Program.
This is going to include about 6,000 nursing students and we will be migrating essentially the entire student body from 26 campuses into Metrix.
Last year we also started doing a consistent quarterly check-ins with our customers. The first half of the year we had 80 out of the 30 clients being quarterly check-ins.
By the second half we had increased that to 15 14 by out of the 30 clients. And this was a, this was a great improvement and also some of the clients that are not using quarterly check-ins is because they&#39;ve been with us for many years.
And I have preferred to communicate via email and and not have a quarterly meeting. In terms of customer health tracking, we started a monthly review of all of our customers to discuss whether they are an advocate, whether they&#39;re stable or at risk, and we have a dashboard where we track all of our customers
. And essentially, since we started this review process in July, we have turned through proactive. Outreach turned we initially had 13 out of our 30 clients in advocate when we started this review process.
By November, we had 21 out of our 30 one in advocate, 9 out of 31 in 9 out of 31 in stable, and only one at risk.
And that was big and that. One at risk is because we&#39;re uncertain whether that program is going to have trainees next year.
But it&#39;s a significant improvement in our advocacy group. This means that these are individuals that are willing to be a reference for metrics.
And are advocating for us. For 2023, we had one institution that left us and it was a small a contract with the Montefiore Health.
System for curriculum. This was an really an experimental contract. We built our curriculum module for medical schools and this institution wanted to see if they can use our curriculum module to manage the curriculum of a residency program.
And it turned out it was not a great fit. So it was not a loss in the sense that uhm eh we are it&#39;s not a established process and product for that market.
We were Thank you so much for joining if it works and we learned something from it. From a marketing standpoint, we attended the AAMC Conference in Baltimore, the ACGME Conference in Seattle, And the ACGME, sorry, the AAMC, AAMC Conference in Baltimore, I&#39;m sorry, AACOM, ACOM Conference in Baltimore.
And then ACGME Conference in Nashville and AAMC Conference in Seattle, all three conferences were in-person and a huge success. We had multiple leads being generated and that are, we&#39;re still in contact with.
The other thing that we started doing at the AAMC Conference, we had to start bringing additional team members so that there&#39;s expanded coverage and also started recording some promotional videos were there so that we can use it for marketing.
From a customer success standpoint, we continue to do our monthly webinars with training. And this is something that we&#39;re trying to improve in 2024.
So there&#39;s more proactive outreach to customers. From a sales standpoint, we had a large number of renegotiation with Atalem Global.
This is our largest client with multiple medical schools and a nursing school. This renegotiation came after four years of them being a client and we restructured.
Their contract so that they&#39;re almost doubling in their subscription rate over the next three years. This was a huge win for us and also for our relationship with them so that we can continue to provide higher quality services.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0e7f3e752aa0489f85abd67ee133210e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;re going to take a look at the new schedules page that we have created for the clinical teams, and essentially this is going to be a tool for residents, fellows, and faculty members to look at their clinical program, see where everybody is working, and also have visibility into where
other team members in different departments are working. So from your metrics dashboard, there&#39;s a new button called My Schedule. If you click on that, it&#39;ll load up the My Schedules page.
And on this page, if you go to a specific date, it&#39;ll show you who&#39;s assigned to a schedule on that date.
So if I go back to May 21st, or May 5th, 2021 in this demo example, I can see that I have my schedule for internal medicine rotation and a shift for outpatient clinic.
It also shows me the time for that shift. If I remove my name at the top, then I can see the schedule for my entire department, where different team members are working, what shifts they&#39;re working, and so on.
At the top, I can also filter for rotations or shifts if I want to. So, rotations. Rotations, shifts, and also time off, off days.
So, let&#39;s say if I just want to see the shifts, I can enable the little checkbox here, and now I&#39;m only looking at shifts for May 5th.
Here at the top, I can also search for a specific resident, fellow, or attending, and see their schedule. In here, under the program field, I have the opportunity to look at different schedules.
What&#39;s the gastroenterology schedule for today, and who&#39;s covering. Top right, we have the option to export to Excel and to print it.
And then I can also search in here, if I go back to John, our uhm internal medicine schedule here. I could look up outpatient clinic here by typing and it will filter only for outpatient clinic.
And I click this X button to close. If I click My Schedule, it will automatically pre-populate with John Dorian, who&#39;s the resident that I&#39;m logged in as, and show that user schedule.
The top right, there&#39;s a couple of buttons. One is to go back to my metro system. The other one is to go to the timeline view.
The timeline view allows you to see the schedules for multiple days at a time. So if I want to see a schedule for let&#39;s say May 1st.
May 1st, 2021 until the end of June 2021. Now it&#39;s going to show me all of the schedules for John Dorian, who has an internal medicine program and that&#39;s his primary program.
And I can see his schedule, his rotations, and his clinics. For his clinic, you can see it shows up on the specific date with the, the time that he starts and the time that he ends.
If I remove John Dorian&#39;s name, then I&#39;m gonna, I will be able to see all of the residents for internal medicine for that specific date range.
So you can see here. If I were to build a schedule and remove John Dorian, then it&#39;s going to pull up every person.
From the residency program, from the Internal Medicine Residency Program, what their schedule is. And this shows both the block schedules as well as the shift schedules and also color codes are based on the shifts.
If I want to focus in on a specific rotation or a shift, I can click into it and it shows the rotations, the residents that are scheduled to that particular rotation.
The nice thing about this particular page is that I can go to the top and I can look at the URL and bookmark it.
If I bookmark this, every time I come back to this page, it&#39;s automatically going to pull up the schedule for this rotation and I can simply adjust the dates and I can see who&#39;s going to be where.
Working in my, in this particular rotation. This is especially helpful for attendings to see who is going to be working with, in their department.
Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a cardiologist and I want to know which residents are going to be coming to my rotation in, in June.
Then all I have to do is bookmark the cardiology rotation schedule and then go to June and I&#39;ll be able to see that schedule popped up.
You can also clear this and go back to the full list and anywhere. On this search field, I can start typing a rotation name and it&#39;s going to filter by that particular rotation.
So let&#39;s say I want to choose internal medicine. And it&#39;s going to filter down to internal medicine. And the same thing applies for shifts.
Let&#39;s say we want to know who&#39;s covering the ICU. Let&#39;s say let&#39;s do AM shift and we have If I pull up the aim shift here, then it&#39;s going to show me just the aim shift for uhm individuals that are scheduled to aim shift.
And once I have this, I can also go back to the home and look at today&#39;s schedule if I need to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e09ea9a28ccd4f40977c648091005396</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>LinkedIn - Revamp_your_profile_in_2_mins_or_less_with_these_templates_1693020087.pdf - Google Drive - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Ericsson. So the for the header the background image, I wanted to share a couple of notes here, when we are showing that on the LinkedIn profile, we&#39;re going to see that right next to the person&#39;s name with their role.
So it&#39;s going to be redundant to put the name and everything at the top with the title. When it comes to the logo, it doesn&#39;t need to be a major logo right in the middle, because the goal is to highlight the individual and make something that is personal to them.
And that, for example, I&#39;ll pull up a couple examples here. So these are all the documents that I had shared at the top, and I&#39;m sure you can, if you google.
Like best practices for these headers on google, you&#39;ll find, ah, ah, more, ah, I&#39;m looking for the one specifically, this one.
So. If you look at a bunch of these profiles, you can see right at the top, it&#39;s all branded and looks very simple, clean and then also shows right at the top, like this guy is, does.
Coaching and whatnot. Same thing here. So this person&#39;s like, again, this is this is not showing their title or role.
It&#39;s more of something that is making it personal to what they do as far as like, how can, how easily can you make money?
It&#39;s, it&#39;s a marketing person here and it could be a message that says I help or I help. Medical education, medical, medical educators save more time or or I create stories about medical education products.
It, it has to be something that is unique to that individual there, what they&#39;re doing in the company, and not simply showing their title or the company logo.
Let&#39;s see. Yeah, and the social proof aspect of it, that&#39;s also something that people says, but we&#39;re not going to do that.
You know, maybe for someone that&#39;s doing sales. We&#39;ll have like logos, but it doesn&#39;t have to be for everybody. This guy yeah this guy is a set of marketing consultant on leadership and scaling a startup so you can see that right at the top.

Look, we look at their role. What are some of the things that they do and then trying to come up with something that is unique to that individual but also branded in the metrics design style.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a8f8d939123d421c81f67618e491321d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU Programs in Medtrics - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Brandon, I found this spreadsheet that I have sent to Keona on 482022. This is the pricing proposal for Chamberlain and it shows a breakdown of each of the programs and how many students they have as well as the total amount for those.
And at the time, our understanding was that we are pricing for 9,000 students, approximately 9,000 students, and that each of these programs will be coming on pretty quickly.
Once we negotiated the price and we talked through some of the logistics, it was determined that the programs cannot come on pretty quickly and that it needs to be phased out over a period of time and so we agreed that we would still maintain a volume discount even though we didn&#39;t have the volume initially
. So for the first year we only had the AGNP program, which is 100 students. Second year, we added the, the PMH track, and afterwards, a few months later, six months later, I believe we added the FNP track.
So, we are still not, nowhere clear, close to that. 9000 student volume that we need to get to that volume discount.
So, that&#39;s the concern here. We&#39;re not proposing that we See you next time. Adjust the rates for Chamberlain at this time where we&#39;re asking that we activate the licenses.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8b909cd8bfef42109b55bc3d2674e511</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[DEV-1374] [SPECS DONE] Case Logs (A/P) &gt; Case Log Report - make clear that Case Duration and Feedback Duration are in hours and minutes (3.5 hours) and in just minutes (210 mins) for both student/resident and admin portals - Jira - 2 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike, this is, yeah, this is a good one for us to get into the dev queue. The only thing that I had a question there&#39;s a couple of things.
I wanted to talk about it was one, it says case duration in hours and minutes and then it says case duration in minutes.
I think for this one, it would all would always be case duration in hours and then feedback duration in hours because the minutes will be separate.
So it would be 0.75 hours and then we can so we can update the specs for that unless I&#39;m missing something here.
And then I also wanted to include another tweak here. So on the my case hours on the student dashboard</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/64256cfb9e034ee3be4d369f6fcb8581</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(12) Santhosh Cherian, MD | LinkedIn - 20 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So I wanted to go over these images here. So as a person that&#39;s going to be viewing a header, you&#39;re going to see this header right next to the name and it&#39;s going to have your title and everything at the top.
So we don&#39;t need to have something that shows the same thing again because it&#39;s going to look redundant. What we want to do is use this space to communicate something more personal and branded.
We don&#39;t care as much as something that we can have at the top as a right sided subtle thing, but the more important thing is like what is the your role in the company and something that ties that together, it&#39;s going to be a little bit more of a creative process to put that together.
So here&#39;s some examples in this. These are the links, links that I had shared the other day in that channel.
So for example, this person has like a branded look. It has his logo at the top and then it&#39;s this is showing like social proof, which is more necessary for someone that&#39;s on the sales son.
For example, mine may have more social proof but the the fact that this person does coaching and that&#39;s very evident from the top banner here.
So if someone&#39;s in marketing or business development like PJ is, how do we highlight that without just putting the role on there and also make it branded?
You know, I I don&#39;t have the, the perfect solution yet, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s going to be, that&#39;s going to be the key thing.
It&#39;s like, how do we make it look branded personal without making it look like a business card? The, the profile itself is a business card and we have the name and everything in there.
Let me see if I can pull up a couple more. Let me show you some examples here. Let&#39;s see.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/deb6eb6bd548432d91a5048cd6b7ce0a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) My first business went bust at 24. - 3 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So product market if product market fit is not a black and white thing this applies to metrics and enterprise software a lot of times in the small business or consumer software it&#39;s easy to say we do this one thing and we found the market in enterprise software especially in healthcare there&#39;s
very complex workflows and very different ways organizations can use your platform so it&#39;s takes it&#39;s a combination of process building and and getting a team to fully understand the different use cases and then and defining which use cases apply for which type of organizations that is really
the product market it&#39;s not just one feature and identifying one type of use case but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a combination I guess a good way to good way for us to post this is using for the book called calendar sale Thanks for watching.

selling a solution essentially a product is something that you can package and you can and it&#39;s one thing it&#39;s like a Microsoft word is a product something like metrics is a solution it&#39;s a combination of technology Thank you.
And services to provide value to that organization so when a company or a hospital comes to us we take a bunch of different products in our system we take a bunch of services that they need and put together a solution for them so that they get what they get value out of our company.

I wanted to create this short video to go over this proposal and explain what&#39;s in here.
So this summarizes some of the key things that we offer at Matrix. The first page here shows you the different modules that we offer as well as some of the additional services such as all of our clients receive live chat support in the system.
We provide training for the platform, including on-site training if needed. We also help with data migration if you are moving from another platform.
And we also support things like data warehousing if a university requires that. Then all of our modules also come with an API which your IT department can use to connect with other software systems.
And we also include a full knowledge base. The knowledge base includes articles and some videos that can be used to learn how metrics work and also train any new staff in the future.
And metrics includes continuous updates for all these modules and these updates are rolled out every two to four weeks. And then we host a monthly webinar where we explain how that new functionality works.
Our support hours are 8am to 8pm and the live chat, email and phone are the three ways that clients contact us.
The main method is the live chat that&#39;s built into the system so you can click on that chat window and send us a message anytime.
And as far as our onboarding, goes, we break it up into smaller projects. Each of these projects are three months long and it includes a specific process that you want to implement.
So for example, curriculum, it would be a project of its own, and each week we would meet with you. Our team includes Yizhi.
She&#39;s going to be a clinical staff member, a project coordinator, and someone from our technical team. We meet with you every week for 30 minutes, for three months, and that includes the discussion of processes as well as configuring the system and moving data.
These set of meetings will allow us to work with you to identify your needs and ensure that you&#39;re building processes in metrics that will drive the engagement from the students and the faculty.
All right, so and then these are the different modules that we&#39;re including. And it has a brief overview of those.
And down here we have the pricing. So we have price for 844 students, the trainee and the faculty portfolios. Essentially these are going to be the user&#39;s profiles and demographic information.
And then the calendar. This is for bringing together all of the events on one unified calendar. Scheduling for your this includes scheduling for all the students for preclinical and clinical.
And you can use that for your classroom based schedules as well as your block schedules for your clinical rotations. Site management is for affiliated sites.
All of the hospitals that the students go for clerkships and electives manage those and you can even go as far as including any sort of expiration dates for affiliation agreements and metrics will remind you.
And then for evaluations, evaluations will be for all of the module, all of the four years and competency management. So you can use that for setting competencies and then track that over four years which I believe I went through in the demo.
And then for the curriculum, this is an annual fee for the entire curriculum module. Where you can have all of the students, sorry, all of the courses setting all the sessions for those courses and then give faculty permission to set up their objectives and map them.
The additional thing that is going to be included in the next month or so, these curriculum module is going to be Heh.
Heh. Heh. Ahem. Ahem, ahem. Hmmm. Ahem. Good morning, sir. I&#39;m in Sedona. Have you been to Sedona? Arizona. Look at this.
I just had an Airbnb and look at the view. Remind- It reminded me of that road trip. I was telling Mary Beth when we were driving through the the desert yesterday, I was like, this is my whenever Rio and I were driving from California to Vegas.
Yeah. That was a good trip. I gotta make it back to that my favorite place was that that Sequoia National Park where all those huge trees work.
Let&#39;s see. Okay. So for this optimize there. Tell me what where are you stuck at? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
Oh, I&#39;m not seeing it. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be a different course subject code.
It would be CVM 778. E or something. So there, if, for example, let&#39;s go to the left side that you have open there and go to, let&#39;s say, site availability one at the top and see if.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/690d776bc8074dcab11cbc394abc855b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Google Meet - 2 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, Mike. So for this task, I agree that&#39;s a good one for us to get into the dev tasks and putting, putting into to do one comment I had here was this column here says case duration in hours and minutes and feedback duration in hours and minutes.
Based on what we&#39;re showing here, I believe we only need to show hours. So case duration in hours, because minutes is a separate column.
So it would be 0.75 hours and whatever hours we want. And so we can update the specs for that here.
And then one more thing that I wanted to include in this is another minor tweak. This is what the student dashboard looks like.
For our CU, we could log in as one of the students on the staging environment and you&#39;ll see this. A couple of minor things that we can do here to improve user experience is First, we can put commas to separate it out by thousand so ten thousand three hundred sixty nine Put a add commas for every after
the ten So five thousand would have a comma after the five The more important thing here is when you have nothing to show none to show.
So if we only show approved hours here, but people miss that and the sentence here and when it&#39;s done to show they&#39;re contacting people and saying, why don&#39;t I see them?
It&#39;s because we&#39;re only showing approved hours. So we can change this error message here. Is sort of saying none to show.
We can say no approved logs to show. And that way the student understands that even if they have pending cases it doesn&#39;t show up here or, or we can do something.
You can think about it as what&#39;s the best way to do this. You can say no, no hours no approved hours.
And then underneath that we can move this error message under it and say, instead of showing it next to this text at the top, we can put it underneath it and say, only, note that only approved hours will be included in the total.
Only approved logs will be included in the total. Note that only approved logs will be included in the total. Look, maybe showing that separately at the bottom would have a better impact on the user and making sure that it gets, it gets, ah, it gets, ah, red.
And we can say, instead of saying you logged, we can say, ah, total approved. Cases. Total approved cases. So essentially we&#39;re gonna minimize the support volume by making it clear that if it&#39;s pending, it&#39;s not gonna show up here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b486956f492d4971898a904434e51e6b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Purdue Report.xlsx - Google Sheets - 27 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. Wanted to put this on your radar. This is that Purdue report we started designing and this is meant to be a redesign of the subcompany report that&#39;s in the system.
So, if we go to evaluations and then subcompetency report, all we&#39;re doing is updating the design and adding some more information onto the report.
The best approach here is look at the existing report, and then you can take a look at this new version and kind of combine what&#39;s in here with the other report and apply the new design that we&#39;re using.
So for example, I don&#39;t think the other report includes the rotation rotation name, rotation name. Start date and end date.
And we&#39;re also not having the, the different designs and color coding the totals. So in this example. What we&#39;re doing is, for John Dorian we&#39;re showing the totals or the averages for John Dorian and then underneath that it&#39;ll list out I just think this through real quick.
Oh, yeah, so but what this is doing is essentially you have some of the new here. I&#39;m Dorian and Sarah Sam.
These are two students. And they have the role of CVM4. And what this is showing is Sarah Sam was evaluated three times.
By three different people in this rotation. And this is showing the responses they got and the average of those responses at the top.
So if we had another student, it would be like this. And, Like that. And so essentially each person was evaluated multiple times.
We show the scores on the right. Right side. And then we show the averages at the top. And then this column here is showing average across all of the different values in that row.
So 15 is showing the average of that row and 20 is showing average of all the values in that score.
So it&#39;s essentially the subcompetency average. The feedback that we received during the meeting was if a student only has one value, so for example, I&#39;m going to get rid of this first row here.
If a student only has one value and it was only evaluated by one person, they said not to duplicate located.
It, because the average is going to be the same as whatever response they got. So in that scenario, we can simply show it in one row, just delete this, delete this.
So, these are two examples, the top example Sarah, Sam was evaluated by three people showing the values average of the top.
Tom Smith was only evaluated by one person and we don&#39;t want to duplicate the rows so we&#39;re simply putting the values where we would normally see the averages.
The other thing they said was use dashes instead of zeros. So if there&#39;s a zero value we just put a dash instead of a zero.
When we do averages, well that&#39;s, but do not include the zeros. And the other thing they mentioned was when we were running this report right now, we, we provide averages based on role.
We want to add a setting. Maybe we can probably put that in. This design a little bit in a different way. We have a setting section and it&#39;ll show average by role or average by individual and then also show the email report to me setting.
And you can skip this part for now. And you can also skip this Figma link. And then the second tab here, this is the second sheet, we don&#39;t need to change too much here except to redesign it in our new report format.
So, redesign the second page, the first page, we&#39;re going to make the changes that are discussed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ebdd4b414d9f4500ae3ea481950c7f36</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 10 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So this is a new feature request for us to standardize what we have written for creating new templates.

If you create a new client server, these do not get automatically populated. We want to make sure that we&#39;re consistently loading this for all of our new form types.
Also, the general form type description is incorrect. Here, it&#39;s saying use this form type when you try to collect feedback for the entire training program.
That&#39;s not accurate for general form types. Instead we want to say use this form type when you are trying to collect general feedback or a survey that does not evaluate anyone or anything period.
And then say these general form types do not have an evaluatee associated with it period. And Bye! Yeah, actually we can see that this demo server actually contains the proper descriptions.
We can use this whatever we have used on the demo server for the only thing that&#39;s missing here for the institutional is use this form, we can add, use this form type when you need to collect feedback from any, from people across the organization.
You and that&#39;s it. You&#39;ll, you&#39;ll need to say that. We, we can say across the organization, and then that&#39;ll allow them to see that institution evals can be used across your organization between any programs.

I wanted to review this proposal with you in this video. When it comes to metrics, there is a couple of different implementations that we do.
One is for residency programs at the end. The other one is for medical schools or visiting training programs. So I&#39;m going to review this and we&#39;ve included a couple of options here for Gundersen.
So as a platform, it is something that we cover right at different modules that can that can be used for the full academic journey, both on the university side and on the hospital side.
Here we kind of picked out what is relevant to the residency needs and the student needs based on our meeting.
We also provide lives chat support. That is built into it. We do training, which can be done virtually for most clients.
If you want us to come on site, that&#39;s also possible. And then for data migration, if you&#39;re moving from another platform, for example, residency, we support you with that.
And this is something that sometimes we can write scripts that will load the data into the system. So other times we provide templates that you can fill out, and then we would do a bulk import using a flat file.
We also support a data warehousing if that&#39;s needed. And then all of our modules also come with the REST API, which can be used to integrate with other platforms.
And then the live chat I mentioned, so any administrator in the platform can open up a chat window and reach our team in a, in Philly.
And this is something that is very useful for. Administrators, because you don&#39;t have to submit a chat, I mean, a ticket or open up a email client to send us questions.
And then when we respond, it comes back to that inbox in the chat chat window. Or if you&#39;re not in log into metrics, it&#39;ll send an email and there&#39;s also a knowledge base.
That&#39;s. Built in, so we have a different modules listed here and then at the bottom. Actually, I&#39;ll cover this also when it comes to implementation.
We typically break this up into projects and each project can span about 3 months and. It includes weekly meetings, it&#39;s about 30 minutes long and we typically dedicate one hour each week for a particular onboarding project and that includes 30 minutes on our side to prep for the meeting and then 30
minutes with you to talk through different processes, review data and then migrate things into the platform. So that is something that we handle for, in your case, I imagine we&#39;ll have two projects at least, one for the residency project for all the GME onboarding and then one for the student programs
. We may want to break it up into four projects depending on who&#39;s the administrator and are they going to be.
It could be having similar workflows. It could be one for each organization, Bellon Health and Gunderson can have its own onboarding.
It all depends on how you want to structure that. So once we get down here, we cover the support. We&#39;re available.
For questions, you know, 8 a.m. To 8 p.m. Eastern Time through the chat, phone, or email and this is something that you can also arrange additional training through our support team throughout the year.
For example, if a new coordinator is starting, you can use our support team for questions. And then when we get to the pricing, we provided two options here.
The first here is the minimum. So what we recommend as like the bare minimum, if you were to onboard with metrics.
And this is based on the conversation that we had with the administrators. So if you&#39;re going to do for GME, Thank you.
It&#39;s pretty much all of our modules that we&#39;re going to cover, we&#39;re going to need. And we&#39;ve included that along with the total number of licenses, 119 residents and what the total is.
And then for students, you really need some of the core modules, which is the learner of the students. The student profiles, the calendar, and then the schedules.
The total here is for 2,689 students for both the organizations. Then, this here is the, something that we&#39;re going to cover. We&#39;re recommending so that you could take more advantage of some of the other functionality and standardize some of the processes.
And you can, we can talk through this more in a call if we needed. So the learner and educator profiles, which is so that students have a profile, educators have a profile, calendar, schedules.
But also site management. This allows you to manage the relationship with different medical schools that are sending students there, including various affiliation agreements if you have to track those as well as various leadership that you want to track in the system.
Resources is a place to centralize any sort of guides, handbooks. Documents and it&#39;s sort of like Google Drive. It&#39;s built into metrics, but you can give permissions based on metrics roles.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/68025c4080bb480c9e55b2fb86d3bf83</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Proposal for Gundersen Health System - PandaDoc - 16 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon, Dan. I wanted to send you this video summarizing some of the the items that we discussed and we put together a couple of options, one covering what the the essential modules are for what we&#39;re trying to accomplish at Gundersend, and then some of the recommended modules.
And this is a draft that you can review and then we can have a follow-up discussion about each of the items on here.
So the first few pages kind of cover some background on the product. And some of the things that we offer.
So specifically all of our subscriptions include live chat support where your team, your leadership team, administrators can click on a chat icon in the dashboard and reach us and ask questions.
It also includes the training sessions initially as well as we do continuous training as needed. It&#39;s not a separate item if your administrators are needing additional training or if there&#39;s turnover, you can simply reach out to our team and schedule training.
There&#39;s also a built-in knowledge base that Metrix comes with. These articles are now AI powered so when an administrator has a question, instead of having to read through each of the guides or find it, you can simply ask a question and the AI will answer the question.
Metrix also includes continuous updates for all of our modules. So throughout the year, once a month at least, we&#39;re rolling out updates and then presenting that in webinars.
So that the platform is not staying stagnant and we&#39;re continuously growing with the needs of medical education. So the next few pages here cover different modules that metrics also have.
These are quick summaries here. We can always dig into these in more detail in additional calls if necessary. And then at the bottom we have outlined the implementation timeline.
This is a standard implementation timeline. What I imagine happening with Gundersen is we break this up into smaller projects. So we have discussed the clinical students as well as the residents.
Since the merger between the organization it has happened and you&#39;re trying to consolidate processes. I imagine us doing two, two onboarding projects.
One focused on the graduate medical education and the residency needs and the other one focused on the undergraduate medical education and the student needs.
And we can do additional projects if necessary. For example, if the process for a certain group of students is different than another group of students, we may want to do those separately.
But in general, I think two would be sufficient and then they can be a third information project around integrations. So single sign on or sending data with other systems.
That&#39;s essentially working with your IT team. We do a lot of the onboarding process management and development at the beginning.
So in terms of additional staff that&#39;s needed, we really need IT involved for any integrations or single sign on. We also need IT and any sort of administrative staff for data migration.
So this would be some that&#39;s, you know, it doesn&#39;t have to be someone technical, someone that&#39;s really good with data manipulation so that you can take data from one system and convert it into format that you can import into metrics.
And the rest of it, we can work directly with the end users, administrators, student coordinators and help them set up everything up in the system.
So to summarize we need IT for any sort of integrations and any IC developers if they&#39;re involved. And then someone that is helpful, helping with the data formatting for, for migration.
So some sort of data analyst or administrator. So, and then the way that our onboarding works is each project will last about three months.
And we&#39;re meeting with your committee on on a weekly basis, about 30 minutes. And from our side, we put together a committee that involves a physician, a project manager, and someone from our development team.
And each of those individuals will meet with your onboarding team every, every week for 30 minutes. And then by the end of those 30 three months, we would have completed the project and provided the assistance needed to set everything up, train your staff, and then you&#39;re kicking off with the students
or residents. So, I imagine. In about three projects, one for GME, one for medical students, and then one for any sort of integrations.
And these projects can happen simultaneously if necessary. And this kind of summarizes. With our support structure, we provide support for institutions 8 a.m.
To 8 p.m. And it is something that is available in the app as a chat window or you can email or call us.
And we also provide scheduled additional training via Zoom. Alright, so in terms of pricing, there are two pricing options we provided here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d43286717917411f9ed0adcffa9c6623</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>code clouded care - Google Search - 2 October 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Marcus, thank you for pointing that video out. I had missed that email. So the first thing that I wanted to go over like I love the video It&#39;s I really like the changes that was made with the text.
It&#39;s more visual. It&#39;s easy to see. I apologize for Alexander singing in the background. So the first thing that I wanted to point out was if we can find some images that would replace these Hollywood you would looking images it would be awesome like this one, this one, especially this one and then
this one because the rest of them look very natural. And genuine, and then these look like very glamorized photos. I definitely want to get rid of this one with the lady&#39;s mouth open.
Yeah, I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t realize how it, I didn&#39;t realize the difference in those tones until I saw it all together.
Yeah, even if we can&#39;t replace all of them, at least if we can make, replace that one. And then, ah, that&#39;ll be awesome.
And then, the code-clouded care, I like the effect here, about how it speeds up and then this text just stays there.
The question is whether code-clouded care is going to be understood by the audience because the word, code can mean multiple things in healthcare.
For example, when someone is having an emergency and they need CPR, hospitals call a code. And that means that the code is indicating that there&#39;s an emergency and something needs to be done.
I&#39;m assuming what we&#39;re going for here is like software that is causing these kind of challenges. Let&#39;s see Thank you.
I don&#39;t know if I have a better option, but that&#39;s the only one thing that I wanted to point out.
And at the end, we need to do something different with this. Where we have instead of having this, using a, this gray background behind the letters and the logo, it will be cleaner if we can use a gradient.
So, here&#39;s what I mocked up in Figma. Essentially what I did was I took the image and I applied a gradient over it.
So, we can have the video show up without any of the text, then fade into this gradient, and then the text will show up.

I wanted to create this short video to go over this proposal and explain what&#39;s in here.
So this subject summarizes some of the key things that we offer at Metrix. Ah, the first page here shows you the different modules that we offer as well as some of the additional services such as all of our clients receive live chat support in the system.
We provide training for the platform including on-site training. If needed, we also help with data migration if you are moving from another platform.
And we also support things like data warehousing if your university requires that. Then all of our modules also come with an API which your IT department can use to connect with other software systems.
And we also include a full knowledge base. The knowledge base includes articles and some videos that can be used to learn how Metrix works and also train any new staff in the future.
And Metrix includes continuous updates for all these modules. And these updates are rolled out every two to four weeks. And then we host a monthly webinar where we explain how that new functionality works.
Our support hours are 8am to 8pm and the live chat, email, and phone are the three ways that clients contact us.
The main method is the live chat that&#39;s built into the system. So you can click on that chat window and send us a message anytime.
And as far as our onboarding goes, we break it up into smaller projects. Each of these projects are three months long and it includes a specific process that you want to implement.
So for example, curriculum, it would be a project of its own, and each week we would meet with you. Our team includes, usually it&#39;s going to be a clinical staff member, a project coordinator, and someone from our technical team.
We meet with you every week for 30 minutes for three months and that includes the discussion of processes as well as configuring the system and moving data.
And this these set of meetings will allow us to work with you to identify your needs and ensure that you&#39;re building processes in metrics that will drive the engagement from the students and the faculty.
All right. So, and then these are the different modules that we&#39;re including and it has a brief overview of those.
And down here we have the pricing. So we have priced for 844 students. The trainee and the faculty portfolios. Essentially these are going to be the users profiles and demographic information.
And then the calendar. This is for bringing together all of the events on one unified calendar. Scheduling for your This includes scheduling for all the students for preclinical and clinical.
And you can use that for your classroom based schedules as well as your block schedules for your clinical rotations. Site management is for affiliated sites.
All of the hospitals that the students go for clerkships and electives. You can manage those and you can even go as far as including any sort of expiration dates for affiliation agreements and metrics will remind you.
And then for evaluations, evaluations will be for all of the module, all of the four years and competency management. So you can use that for setting competency management.
And then track that over four years at which I believe I went through in the demo. And then for the curriculum, this is an annual fee for the entire curriculum module where you can have all of the students, sorry, all of the courses setting out.
All the sessions for those courses and then give faculty permission to set up their objectives and map them. The additional thing that is going to be included in the next month or so, these curriculum modules is going to be</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f6c8b10c815f46c99391bded5af9bb23</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU - Clinical Learning Contract</pre></td><td><pre>So for the clinical learning contract, we reviewed a few different options and what we wanted to make sure was that it&#39;s a sequence of events that take place that tells everybody what they have to do because I believe that&#39;s going to be the best way for us to make sure that each student gets the attention
that they need. And the faculty and the academic leadership are getting things assigned to them when they need to complete it.
Also, we want to all we also wanted to focus on how do we put provide the full picture to each individual every time they&#39;re looking at the form.
Because a paper form makes it easy to do that because you can, you can simply scroll up and down or go through one page after another and see what other people have wrote and then make your own decisions.
In metrics, since we&#39;re going to be using separate forms, how do we make sure that each individual is able to see what they need to see when they&#39;re filling out their section?
So, when I go through this this document first, then I&#39;m going to go into metrics and show you how it works.
And, ah, I have the original form here. And here we have the sections that are supposed to be completed by the faculty, sections by the academic leaders.
Students and so on. So we looked at the each of the sections, each of the fields, and then created separate set of forms based on what each person has to do at certain interval.
Starting with the first form here, we have faculty members. So faculty members will either have the first form assigned to them or they can initiate that on their own when they feel like they need to initiate a clinical learning contract.
This is a typo here should be CLC. And once they are assigned that form. When they open it up, they&#39;ll see two sections or on the paper version, it was section one and section three.
We can re rename that later if we need to. So that is it&#39;s a section one and two, so that it makes more sense when the faculty is looking at it.
If I go to the system. We open up part one, we&#39;ll see the questions for the faculty members to fill out.
This is coming. From section one and section three. Going back to our problem. I&#39;m going to go through the process here.
Once part one is complete, it will automatically assign to the academic leadership part, their part, which is going to be CLC part two.
And it&#39;s going to have the. Section two, which is clinical learning makeup. When part two is complete, or we can, again, this can be refined based on how it currently happens.
If the students can receive their part after part one. Can be configured based on out bounds setting. Students and the academic leaders will go in there and fill out their sections.
And then once the part two is complete, faculty members will all. They also have a CLC part four assigned to them, which will have sections five, six, and seven.
So this way they have all the required, or required forms available to them when they need to, when they meet with the student.
So let&#39;s take a look at that metrics. So part two, this is for the academic leaders. And we still have a set of questions they have to complete.
And when we look at the faculty portal in a few minutes, I&#39;ll show you that when the academic leaders are looking at the document, they&#39;re going to see what the faculty members submitted.
When the students are looking at it, they&#39;ll be able to see what the faculty members and the academic leaders are looking at it.
Academic leaders are submitted, have submitted. So the student&#39;s form is going to be the, ah, simple describe your performance and any attack.
The first slightly more concerning year part of your Law. That&#39;s all I, for tonighteting. Consequences. Once the faculty members complete that, they&#39;ll have another form assigned to them, which can be.
Completed during the remediation section and, or the opposite remediation section. And that is simply tell the system that they have completed remediation.
Completed after remediation section. And then after completion of part four, they&#39;ll also have the form part six, which is to.
Complete which is to be filled out after the completion of the CLC. Academic leaders will also have their final form assigned to them after after the faculty members complete their section.
So let&#39;s take a look at that. So you have academic leaders. There&#39;s the final section and then. And faculty has their final section.
So you can see that these are broken up into separate forms so that we can assign them at specific time and.
Each person gets what they need. But if we go into the faculty view here. With some customization, what we can do is have a set of forms assigned to them.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0195300891f445a2ba862367cc089822</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>CU - Clinical Learning Evaluations</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this slightly longer video we&#39;re going to go through the process for handling laboratory courses and clinical courses in metrics.
And this process took us some time to develop since we&#39;re moving from paper to digital. In the paper format, the students and the faculty, the faculty can have one set of forms, they can fill it out, bring it with them, hand it to the next person, and then submit everything at the end.
With digital, we want to do this in a way that it&#39;s one thing is assigned, and then something gets completed, and someone else gets another form, and then it happens.
Over a period of time, rather than giving all the questions to the students and faculty at the beginning of the session.
So, this document here outlines the different set of forms that we&#39;ll use for laboratory courses. And for clinical courses. The major difference that I saw from the paper version is that clinical courses have weekly competency reviews.
While the laboratory courses, the competency these are only getting reviewed at midterm and final. So for this video, I&#39;m going to be using the laboratory courses as a way to explain the process, but it&#39;s going to be the same process that we&#39;re going to use for clinical courses with additional
questions. And then we&#39;ll be using the laboratory courses as a way to explain the process. Competency questions, these comments at the bottom and these weekly comments and turning them into evaluation forms.
So if I go to metrics and let&#39;s take a look at the midterms. Student CLE midterm laboratory courses. Open that up.
I can see all my competencies here. These are. The competencies that we have here and the evaluation comment requirements based on the answers that is picked.
So if they put unsatisfactory or needs improvement, then they can be forced to enter a comment explaining the reason why.
And then all the way at the bottom, we have our. Our overall course performance and the students comments for faculty.
We have the same form. Same questions except. For the comment field at the bottom. That&#39;s going to be the fact designated faculty comments and that&#39;ll be slightly different for the faculty versus the students.
So the, the process here is admit term. The student evaluation and the faculty evaluation will get us. Assigned at the same time when the student completes it and sends it to the faculty, the faculty will be able to review it and then submit their own form.
So if I open this up here. This is a faculty member that is going to the evaluations page sees a form that is assigned to them or they will get an email and then click on an email and then go straight to the form.
And it&#39;s going to tell me that I&#39;m evaluating this, this student. And in this particular rotation and these course codes are from the post licensure programs and metrics.
When we onboard BSN program, these courses will be also be showing the BSN courses. Right at the top. I. Can open up what the students feedback was review everything and then submit my own response.
And then I get to the bottom, I can do the overall comment, overall feedback, and then designate a faculty comments and submit.
And then submit that. So this process for midterm and final will be very similar. Both student faculty gets an evaluation faculty will be able to see what the students submitted and then submit their own version.
We can also use our outbound module to trigger a clinic. Clinical learning contract if there is poor performance that meets that criteria.
For students reviewing and acknowledging that they saw the feedback metrics has a review functionality that can be. The, the, the, the process.
So if you go to evaluations, go to assignments. And I have. I have. A submitted form here. I open that up and I go all the way to the bottom.
There&#39;s going to be a way for either the student or the faculty members. To submit a review and sign it.
So this is a way for. Students and faculty members to add additional comments or sign off that they&#39;ve seen an evaluation form.
For weekly formative. Feedback. That&#39;s the set of questions that we have on the paper form. We&#39;ve created a separate. Template.
This is called the weekly formative feedback comments. And this form is going to be assigned to the students and to the faculty members on a, sorry, to the students on a weekly basis.
And when they submit that form, it&#39;ll be something that the faculty members can review and sign off on. And once the faculty members sign off on a review, the students can go in there and add their own review and sign off that they have, they have acknowledged the they have read all the faculty&#39;s
feedback. So essentially closing the loop. Students submit first, faculty reviews it, students can go back and then acknowledge they&#39;ve seen it.
So that&#39;s the process for the clinical. Learning evaluation for mid laboratory courses. Clinical courses is going to follow the same process except the weekly form will also have the competencies.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5bb922f1263448e4915e989fcad6f176</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 31 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good afternoon.

Show up right on their login homepage, and it can be a good place to welcome them and also to provide any important messages you want to them to be aware of as part of their.
Onboarding, whether it be for metrics onboarding or for their residency onboarding. So that&#39;s. Something that you can do if correct from the dashboard, including any attachments and post out there.

Executive assistant folder that we&#39;ve been using. We&#39;ll call this. _____. _____. What I would like you to do is create a document that includes a profile of each of the team _____.

Okay. First part paid. And emergency contact. So essentially what we want to do is fill out this profile for each of the team members.
And if we look at metrics. For some of the team members, you can go and find it in metrics. So if I go let&#39;s say.
If I click on Chris and go to view profile, you can see his phone number. Address, start date, and birthday in metrics.
So what you can do is copy that from here. And then once we get- to the people that we don&#39;t have, then we will have to ask them.
And if people have other contact information, like WhatsApp or Telegram. You can also include that here for number. So. Let&#39;s see.
So let&#39;s see. My name. So we can do it like. And the anniversaries. So we&#39;re reminded of that when it&#39;s coming up.
So first step is for us to collect all the information. Then we&#39;ll work on updating that.. Let&#39;s see.

I was looking at your account to see if I can find out what the setting was and if it was enabled for seeing confidential information and It is set up to show that Competential information if you if you need to see it.
So on the value And assignments page there&#39;s two buttons here one is the view most recent response the other one is the full form So if you open up the view recent response, it&#39;ll show you the reveal button and this is what you&#39;re as an administrator is meant to look at the something that was submitted
already there is this other button called full form and it is meant to be used when an administrator is submitting an evaluation on behalf of someone else.
So we added this a while ago because there are some institutions where they have staff who want to do it on paper and this button allows an administrator to go in there and on behalf of a faculty member.
But if you use the standard view recent response it&#39;ll show you the reveal button. As for the PDF currently we don&#39;t show the confidential information on the PDF.
And the reason we don&#39;t do that is because of when it was done for the GME and the physician training revealing that confidential information was something that they did not want to, like for the accreditation requirements, you can&#39;t show that anywhere and this revealing was only for specific individuals
when they&#39;re troubleshooting some sort of a problem. So we only added to one location in the system and that is the most recent response.
Let me know if that will meet your needs and you&#39;re able to. Get the information you need if you need to have it on the PDF to send it to someone else.
It&#39;s something that we can work on adding. The it&#39;s not a quick thing that we can do because we have to make sure that it&#39;s done in a way that it doesn&#39;t accidentally show information to any of the other clients.
But right now you can access it on the view recent response window as needed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4241235125e9418ebeb0124c738e2c8e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Introduction to Schedules - Google Slides - 3 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video we&#39;re gonna take a look at how we can automate 360 degree evaluations in metrics and drive them using the schedules.
First we&#39;ll take a look at the different types of schedules that metrics offers. So, in this video we&#39;re gonna take a look at how we can automate 360 degree evaluations So, in this video we&#39;re gonna take a look at how we can automate 360 degree evaluations and how they can be used in clinical education
and classroom based education. Then we&#39;ll tie those evaluations, I mean those types of schedules to evaluation templates to see how automation is driven.
So, in metrics there are five different types of schedules. That can be used across the university portion of clinical education for nursing education.
And then within the clinical training that happens in hospitals and clinics. And then there&#39;s the general calendar that can be used for various events.
So in classroom based training. Which happens in universities. So for this is for the first two years of medical school or for the, the pre, the preclinical portion of nursing education.
We have course schedules and session schedules. For the preclinical education, where they&#39;re in the hospital, we have block schedules and shift schedules.
And then for both groups, whenever there&#39;s one-off events or there are lectures that are not directly part of the, the the training career.
Like in the hospital setting where they have lectures that happen throughout the day, those go into the general calendar, which resembles like a Google calendar.
So let&#39;s take a look at each of these. So in core scheduling, this portion. Of the schedules are, is managed under curriculum rotations, courses and rotations.
Here, they can set up all of their courses. Each of these courses are tied to an academic period. And then, when you&#39;re on this page, you can define for each course what the start date and end date is.
And then, you put students into these courses using groups. So, we create user groups and then link those groups to these courses.
Next, we have session schedules. Session schedules. Are under curriculum under sessions. So, for each academic period, so a semester, I can select a course.
And inside of the course, we have the different lectures, labs, and other things that make up the course. And for each academic period, so a semester, I can select a course.
The scheduling of these sessions, we create a session. And inside of that session, I can create a new schedule, select a date, time.
When it happens, who will give that specific lecture or lead the, the small group session, where it takes place and then select specific groups here.
The groups that I see here are only. The groups that I connected to this particular course. So I&#39;m essentially sub-selecting groups to be a part of a specific lecture.
Next, we have the block schedules. So under schedules, clinical schedules, we have block schedules. So for block schedules to work, we have to have rotations in the system.
So rotations are essentially like courses for. Or clinical training. So we have different types of medicine that they&#39;d be learning in different hospitals.
And so last time we spoke about sites. This time we&#39;re saying we&#39;re seeing rotations being connected to sites. And once these.
And so once the rotations are in here, I can go to schedules, clinical schedules and add. A block schedule so I can create a block schedule template.
Once the block schedule template is created, I can open it up and then. Assign students or residents to each of these rotations.
And it&#39;s called block schedules because these are structured as blocks of time, which may be two weeks, four weeks. Calendar month and so on.
Next we have shift schedules. Shift schedules are essentially hourly assignments that are used in clinical practice. So blocks you may be at a particular department for four weeks.
Shift is going to say every Wednesday you&#39;re going to be covering a clinic from noon to 4pm. So that&#39;s how they they put the students into different clinics.
And shift schedules are also used for on-call. So if I&#39;m going to be working on a Saturday and covering the hospital as on being on-call, then that would be a good thing.
That would also be a shift schedule. So the way that it works is we create shift templates. NYAH,.. Yup, let&#39;s see if we can find, yeah.
So we can create these shift templates that say Monday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we&#39;re gonna have a shift take place from this time to this time.
And we can also generate pattern to span four weeks. And once these shift templates are created, we have a slot for us to put physicians into.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e9a5cee4814a4fefbd763dee216aea4b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Faculty Mentor ability to manage and review submitted evals by commenting and uploading docs – Figma - 3 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mitch, I watched your video and I wanted to explain what is happening here. When we worked on this portfolio task, we had broken it up into two components.
The first component was to be able to give the students and the mentors the ability to submit reviews. That is what was released and that is the first part that had to be developed before we can add the second part, which is the permission component.
So there is another piece that is in development where we can, go into the system setup and permissions and select a few, the templates that are designated for portfolio and we can say which roles have access to the, submissions on these templates.
So once that is enabled, we&#39;re going to be able to give the mentors access to a page called Review. And on this page, they&#39;ll have a filter called Form Filter, and they can filter and open up the submissions that they have to review.
So that&#39;s why you&#39;re not seeing that feature on your portal. The team is working on, and I know that you have a training scheduled on Monday.
I can&#39;t guarantee that it&#39;s going to be out by then, but what we can do is put together a few slides that includes screenshots of what the page will look like so that you can use it for training.
And as soon as it&#39;s ready, we will put it out there. If there is a way that we can get it out before your training, we&#39;ll do that.
But otherwise, at the very least, we&#39;ll give you the training material so that the mentors can access it as soon as it is available.
It&#39;s basically going to be, a menu item on the left side. It says Review. And it&#39;s going to be Evaluations.
And they&#39;ll have all these filters on there. And they can filter and find what they need and open it up.
Currently, we do have a way to give, mentors access to all the evaluations. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a problem.
My understanding it is giving them access to all the evals is probably too much data that they can see on a student.
So because we currently have the all the evaluation permission being granted. To the mentors or nothing. This what this new feature we&#39;re adding is giving you the ability to specify which templates you want to share with them.
I hope that helps clarify the what you&#39;re seeing there. And and the reason that this took longer than expected was we had to finish the first part, which is to submit the reviews with attachments before we can build a permission for it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bdfb3618b9224ec993109a1d5e705be8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Prompt - Google Docs - 25 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Highlight, so this has the prompt that I created and what we want to do is we will take this full prompt and go into GPT-4.

And same thing with a preceptor, we can have it as faculty. But you also want to consider how things will get assigned in metrics.
So evaluations are automatically assigned to different individuals based on their role. So if you have one set of evaluations that need to be assigned to the preceptor and a different set that needs to be assigned to the faculty members, we may, it&#39;s best to have.
Two separate roles for those those users. Some users like Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Dean of Faculty. These individuals will likely have similar functionality in metrics.
So you can get away with one role called faculty. Primary as well as other roles for faculty will be set up in banner and pushed into metrics.
So, we don&#39;t accept role creation in metrics through an API. What you can do is make sure that we have.
The roles created in metrics that match what you have in banner. And then when users are getting pushed, you can select the appropriate role that they should get in metrics that match their banner profile.
Visiting professor, same. Can you access the faculty attached to their science CRN? Can faculty of record and both have direct and SSO access?
Yes, you can have both metrics access and you can have SSO access. They&#39;re two independent things and if one user needs to log in as metrics authentication, they could do that.
If another user has SSO, they can access using SSO. So a couple other things that I noticed here is students do not have direct access to metrics.
I would think that they need they need to have access. Coup would think that students will have SSO access. So I think that covers everything that you outlined here.
So in general, try to be more generic with the roles and think about how things will be assigned. And I outlined a couple things here, for example.
A and ADOF you can create Dean. Same thing for SLS and SLS. You can create a role called learning specialist.
If one of the learning specialists needs to have access to. All campuses you can give that individual permission to access all campuses.
Without having a different role. So permissions are independent of role and you can have two people with the same role with different set of permissions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9eee5e3f898b4b5685fdfd9f48275b24</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Viewing product features. - 3 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mark, so if you take a look at see that link that I had, this thing.

Use the challenger salesperson approach. So it created this. Then I said write a list of objections. To handle it as a challenger salesperson.
And here I wrote write scripts for sales outreach. So it&#39;s using the text from the previous conversation. To write these drafts and on this part, instead of writing a campaign that includes emails, LinkedIn, and phone calls, it is good for us to say, write a series of three email.
It&#39;s a free email for a sales campaign to deans of clinical education using the Challenger sales approach. And then include, include these sections here.
And then I&#39;ll write those three emails. And those three emails that it writes is going to be related to the previous emails.

One, they want to be able to see who is coming to a rotation in the future. So, if I give this link to someone, it will be great if we, We one have a rotation assert filter here, so that I can filter by a specific rotation.
And then, also add a share button. That allows me to create a URL that I can bookmark or share that will apply the filters.
That I have selected. So apply specifically the the program, the rotation. So once I filter it and I click share, it will bring up a, a way to gen copy the URL.
Like a little window, a model. And if I send that to someone, it&#39;ll update the page for the filters that I have selected at the top.

I wanted to share an update with you on a brand new page that we&#39;ve been working on for schedules.
During our previous calls with the internal medicine departments the common theme was that the schedules module wasn&#39;t very easy to do.
It was easy to work with and it was frustrating for residents and staff members to look up who&#39;s covering which schedule and also to look up any any information side by side for multiple residents.
So this is something that we are working on addressing and this page that I&#39;m sharing today is being shared as an early preview.
It&#39;s not being released to all of the users. We&#39;re hoping that you can take a look at it and share some feedback and, and we want to continue improving on this interface so that all of the trainees can quickly.
And we&#39;re hoping that you can continue to find information about their schedules, their colleagues schedules, and eventually we&#39;re also going to expand the capability to add way to edit schedules in a similar manner.
So first part we&#39;re addressing is the way to look it up and then adding on the editing capabilities later. So for this example, for this demo, I&#39;m using KP&#39;s San Francisco internal medicine program.
And the way that we access this page is to go to the kp.metricslab.com and then slash schedules. You have to be logged into metrics to access it.
And then when you get to this page, you&#39;ll see that there is the date at the top. And then there&#39;s also a few filters for type of schedule, the program name, and a way to select one individual.
Right now you can only select one individual. We are working. And then we are working on a way to expand this to have multiple individuals selected at a time.
So let&#39;s take a look. By default it comes to the today&#39;s date. But I can expand this to select dates in the past or dates in the future.
And let&#39;s say if I look at I can clear up, I had one filter applied there. Instead I&#39;m going to clear that out and see everybody.
And on this schedule, I could let&#39;s say we want a filter for one of our residents. You can see what schedules they&#39;re covered up.
Asya is covering for the next couple of months. And this page is also searchable if I want to find a particular shift.
It&#39;s a word. Or and that this page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/417684b35c714863b5e8defe13019be6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Mike. So a couple of issues here. One is that when a user saves an evaluation forum as a draft, it says we&#39;re going to be added, adding that to the to do tab.
There is no to do tab. It&#39;s only for me and about me. So we want to make sure that alert is updated to say for me.
And on this page, we also want to capitalize the M for me. And the other issue with this page is that the filter shows incomplete, but it doesn&#39;t show.
Overview by default. So all you want to do is make sure that by default. Overview by default. Yeah, this sort of the renaming of the alert and this renaming of the M can be one task.
And the other overview and. Incomplete together.. And we can maybe call that pending.. Or we can call it to-do or something and we can.
It&#39;ll be a to-do and that includes pretty much everything that they have to do. And that overdue and incomplete would fall under that to-do status.
And then complete, canceled, unable to assess.. I think, also instead of, we may, yeah, we&#39;ll probably have to mock something up and come up with a design for this to make it easier instead of having.
And to click this dropdown, these filters should be visible so that people don&#39;t miss it. Overdue and incomplete, going into to do, then completed, completed and canceled, unable to assess.
. Almost like, like buttons that show up here that they can click on and filter quickly, instead of having to, instead of being hidden in a dropdown.
And I think Rio may not like that. Let&#39;s, let&#39;s see what we can come.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c75e9e3fe8134d46b88170ef6801e4bf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 1 June 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So, for this permission, what we want to do is update a few things. One is, instead of saying manage students&#39; personal documents, we can say manage users&#39; personal, documents,and then update that here also, because you can do this more than just users.
I mean, just, you can do this more than students and it could be any user. And also let&#39;s use a regular font size that is, equal to the regular text.
This gray small text is very hard to read for some of our users. It&#39;s better to keep it as standard text for all of the permissions where we have light gray text.
And the other thing that we want to do is anywhere that we have site select site, we want to add this all sites option.
So user groups, all sites. For student personal documents, all sites. Same for managed case logs, all sites. And then here student update that to trainees.
Same for trainees in the following groups. Like this. So two, three changes. One is fixing the font size and color so that it&#39;s normal regular text.
Renaming students to users on the documents. Renaming students to trainees here. And then adding the All Sites option for anywhere that we have sites.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7bfd82229eb0435d87c0c0a33d3ee331</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 18 May 2023</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to generate case log summaries and cases can be accessed from cases and logs page on the admin portal.
And on this page, there&#39;s a several tabs. The first tab will allow us to filter for different. Case logs and we can simply choose a date range and choose to filter.
And it shows up all of the logs here. And then if you want to export this to an Excel, you can click the Excel button.
And that&#39;ll generate an Excel first. To download. You want to generate a PDF. We can do that here. And that will generate a PDF.
There&#39;s also the diagnosis scene. And procedure scene page. Which can also be exported to Excel. Those are the, the exports that we have on the cases, cases page.
If that&#39;s not sufficient, we also have reports. That you can run to export the data. So under reports and the cases tab, we can export a compliance summary for an individual.
Log summary of, of a group of individuals such as all the first year residents, first year, second year residents and so on.
And then we can also download the entire case log for a resident to a spreadsheet. You can either select an individual or you can also select a role and export the case logs for all roles.
Case logs summaries can also be seen by total completed and we can also do an export of a compliance summary from the an audit.
So let&#39;s say if I want to select a date range here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/89010a4760974a2e935da41eb5f77597</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Site Rotator + Block Schedule Audit Report</pre></td><td><pre>All right, so these are updates that we&#39;re going to be making to the block schedule auto report and site rotator report.
I&#39;m putting them together because we may be able to copy the queries from one to the other. So the first thing here is that when we delete a user schedule record, we are storing the deleted record in a historical user schedule table.
And we are storing a bunch of fields in there, but we&#39;re missing it. A few of them. So when we look at the audit report for a deleted record, we can see that we have some fields like the rotation name, the dates the old dates are all showing.
What we have to do is add the students. Employee ID field. So either we can store it in the historical record or reference it on the block schedule audit report.
We can we need to show the the graded courses. Body ID field. So eitherup and single data field. That was deleted.
From the user schedule record and the enrollment status. That was deleted. So we have to create back end fields on the historical user schedule to track this information.
For the employee ID and the graded course rotation. If it&#39;s possible to link to the to the table, it&#39;s fine to do that.
Actually, it&#39;s for the graded course rotation is probably best to store the. The rotation code for the rotation that was deleted, the user schedule that was deleted.
And for the employee ID. If the, if the first and last name is stored as a text in the historical records, we can also store this as text.
And then the historical record. So that&#39;s the first part. The second part on the block schedule auto report is to update the filters.
To match what we have on the site grade rotator report on the site rotator report. We have the select individual field.
We want to add that here. We have the great, great book rotation drop down. We want to add that here to be able to filter by that.
And then we also want to do class off filter here. The other thing. Is the from and two dates as well as the start and end dates on both reports.
We want to make sure that if I select a start date and end date, the results include that date. So if I right now if I choose April.
18th as the end date. It really showed events up to 17th. It doesn&#39;t include that end date. So this is confusing to the user.
So you want to make sure any start and end dates that we have on both reports have the from and.
You can see here a number of them to match here. Number three is add the employee ID number under here and we can also put the role in parentheses.
Similar. To the way that we have it on the. The site rotator report and we can bold it and use the same formatting here.
Then. This information should also be included as separate columns in the Excel export. And. Last thing here. The. For the other thing is that the class of field.
I see.. We can skip that.. What I if the. The class of field is a difficult thing to add here for filter.
It&#39;s that&#39;s one thing that can be left out. We definitely need the individuals and great course, great book rotations. And the great book rotations is the graded course rotations in the back end.
Next thing here is. We have the. Checkbox here. They also wanted to see the status of pending enrollment. So if a checkbox is turned off, we&#39;ll show the red pending enrollment here.
And if it&#39;s turned on, it&#39;ll show the green enroll status. It&#39;s. That allows us to quickly find once they have to address.
So that&#39;s everything for the block schedule auto report. For the site rotator report, we want to fix the spacing here.
There should be a space after Abby and then no. The space between the the O and the parentheses and the same thing at the end here.
So I put an example over here. We also want to show for the rotation info here. The graded course rotation code above.
Of the rotation. So this column shows rotation info as well as shift schedule info. If we&#39;re showing a rotation, we also want to show the corresponding graded course rotation in bold.
And this should be added as a new column on the Excel export.

So we have a form one. Which is going to be for students self evaluation. That&#39;s actually, let me back up a little bit.
So we have two sections, one for clinical learning evaluations, laboratory courses, another section for clinical learning evaluation for clinical courses.
And within each of those, we have four forms. The first the first one is going to be student self-evaluation midterm.
That&#39;s going to capture the sections relevant to the student. And when they fill that out, we&#39;ll pull that up here as a preview.

I started riving this out when I think it&#39;s easier to go on a bloom call. So for this first item, I&#39;m not a fan of these column customizations.
Because people will forget to turn that on and will think that it&#39;s not doing what it should be doing. We can certainly have separate views for residents versus students.
But we should define those views and then show. Show it to the user without having them to create their own view.
So if we have everything designed. Then. If there&#39;s an issue with the. Where that we&#39;re showing too much too much too many columns for the residents.
Or for. Someone like a student that is with one school versus another school. We can add a setting for it.
But the first thing to identify is. What groups of people. You want to not show everything to. And then we can decide how to hide it.
Second thing for the assignment rules. I&#39;m okay for we had talked about it. This problem. Multiple times with the with Chris and the understanding was that it doesn&#39;t always require both of these to be selected.
That&#39;s why we went with the radio button. What it&#39;s if we brought it up again. It&#39;s probably something that we can just.
So that we&#39;re not losing functionality. So my thought here is if I&#39;m gonna I would change this to a. A check box so all rotation supervisor selected and then we wouldn&#39;t want to have another check box that says.
All rotation supervisors and then another one will be.. Individuals on the schedule. That would be the check box and when we when they turn on the check box.
And individuals in the block into. That a schedule on the block schedule and when you turn that check box on we&#39;ll have two sub radio buttons.
That radio button will say. With the following roles or. With the following groups. So. Two. Check boxes second one will have two radio buttons where they can pick which one they want to use.
And if we apply this to this design. We want also applied for. Anywhere. Else we&#39;re using the same concept for who will complete this form.
Cause I think the other. Look at it real quick. Yeah, so we have all speakers and then same. Concept so everywhere would be all speakers ready a checkbox then a second checkbox says individuals invited to the event and then two radio buttons underneath it.
And says with the following rolls versus with the following user groups. And I think that applies for all of it.
Different one types. So this one, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have a way to test this yet. So maybe you can try this.
Now you would want to go into schedules. Shift schedules. And create a shift schedule for for a site. And assign people to that.
So you would open that up. So if I open this up. You&#39;re going to go to manage templates, create a template, and then go to the assignments page and assignment someone to that schedule.
Next, what you would do is go to the system setup rotations page. And on this page, we&#39;ll have a list of rotations, and I can click the second icon to manage shifts, and then select one of the shifts that I created, and then apply that here.
So once I apply that here.. So notice how here we have days of the week we can select. When you created a template, you would also have to set the date of the week.
I&#39;m not sure if. How this works if you choose on the template that the clinic happens Monday Friday and then you come in here and choose Tuesday Thursday Friday.
Is it going to apply for all three or is only going to apply for the overlapping day, which is Friday?
That&#39;s something that we want. I&#39;m going to test when we do this. So once a shift schedule is listed and created and linked to a rotation schedule like I&#39;m doing here, next thing is to go into the actual block schedule.
Assign as. Student to that schedule. Assign a student to that rotation. So once you would open it up and select a student schedule and then assign them to that rotation that we have the shift schedule automation connected.
Finally, go to the. Company Portal. Go to. Sandbox. And then shift auto assign. For trainees. Run that. Once it&#39;s run.
We want to go to the schedules page. Shift schedules. Open up that sketch. Shift schedule and see we have the new resident that we assigned to that rotation.
Assign to the same shift that we picked. So it&#39;s a bit of a complex setup. I haven&#39;t been able to get it to run.
So if you have any luck, let me know. Next. Dashboard notification for admins. Yeah, I really like this.. What we want to do is also.
Like, like sex unsuccessful. On a specific date. I&#39;m not really sure what that would mean if the salary is going to say we ran the assignment algorithm on that day.
. And delivered is also something that we use for emails, not necessarily for. And I would maybe add a way to select a date range.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c155ec27f281417788a2eeb51d842002</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Attention - Real-time Conversation Intelligence for Sales - 26 April 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Alondra.

And then maybe copy and paste the the initial message that came to us. This way it&#39;s easy for us to go through it and share that information with them of the type of questions we&#39;re getting.
And if the first question that they sent to us was just like, hi, we obviously want to capture a little bit more so that we could determine what type of problems we&#39;re having.
This is partly for internal review and then partly for us to share with them the type of things that they need to address on their end.

Let&#39;s see if, I don&#39;t think we have an existing project that we can re repurpose for this. So I think the best approach is to create it for modeling after the, after the dev project.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/010be9b664f44176be8c8bf28047f38c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 9 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So for L M U, they have sites in here with no site codes and they were using the site code field for something else.
And we&#39;re gonna ask them to move these numbers out of here for now. But for us to be able to import the block schedule, we have to put site IDs in here.
I was wondering if we can do this using the a p i internal by downloading a list of sites and then re-uploading it with like an A number.
And Mitch is fine with us simply using 1, 2, 3, 4, and populating the IT with an id. And then once status uploaded, then we, they, they sent over a block schedule that we have to help &#39;em import and that doesn&#39;t have the site IDs in there.
It has the site names, and then we can do a V lookup so that the site IDs are populated. And then we can submit that for upload here.
So let me know if that&#39;s possible. I&#39;m gonna be posting the the CSV file too. And if someone can help do that, that&#39;d be amazing because they&#39;re waiting for us to load the schedule.
And even if we can do it on staging and make sure the file is good and then apply the site numbers to production, we can send that file back and have them upload it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c80bd738749348189022bf06c3423386</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 13 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey ship. Thank you for all the great work you did on this task. I was testing out the students side and it looked really nice.
And if I look at this request for addiction psychology, July 3rd to July 20 third, the requested rotation was addition addiction Psychiatry.
Well, for some reason it&#39;s, it is showing up as one day less here, and date is 29th, even though it&#39;s 30th here.
But the other thing is that I approved it and on the block schedule audit report, we&#39;re not showing that as a removal of the original request, which was for rotation swap rotation.
So if I go here, This was a rotation that I&#39;m using, so I replaced that with the addiction psychiatry rotation.
And what I should see here is delete records for two rotation swap rotation, and one add log for the addition psychiatry.
So because I&#39;m replacing two existing rotation, both of them will be deleted and then a new one will be added.
So we wanna make sure that these records are also getting created as part of this approval. So everything looks good.
The we&#39;re with the student side, the admin side. When we&#39;re looking at the log, the end date is showing off as one day less.
And I&#39;m wondering if it has something to do with time zones. And the audit log is not picking up the deletion and the addition.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2370ade3e0ba40ba8798bf54973e3c62</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 9 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Alejandra.

And then let&#39;s see, for here. So there&#39;s a lot of these like older ones, so check that and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything for sales.
Nope. And then you could recheck so it&#39;s St. James, so like that. So we would want to check all of the ones that we are currently onboarding.
But, so that&#39;s gonna be the Purdue, L m u, Michigan State Atal. And then the other ones that I sent you.
I think it&#39;s gonna be, it&#39;s if you, if you, if we can check all of them, it&#39;s good too, cuz there may be tasks that are stuck in there that we want to have in one document.
And then I want the team to go through it and make sure that they mark off the ones that it&#39;s done.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ebbaa2b8683f48d584289a903fbda1cd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Front (592) - 8 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Alejandro. So I wanted to go over this with you. So this particular one is not for M S U, so it&#39;s for it&#39;s for Marshfield Clinic.
So it&#39;s Marshfield, it&#39;s a different client. And then for we gotta make sure that we check for typos. So you can use Grammarly, that tool that I, that I set up.
So you can use that to check for typos. And also when it comes to sending these greetings, it&#39;s important to follow a certain format.
So it&#39;s hi. I usually use hi Deanna, and then space. And here&#39;s a summary of our discussion. And we don&#39;t want any extra spaces here.
And then back space there. And then if there are typos here, you can use that tool. Think that&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t catch access on site That, So it&#39;s important, it&#39;s important for us to make sure that the formatting and everything is good so that it comes off more professional for the
client. And, and then and sometimes this tool will pick up on things that you can fix. Okay. I think that&#39;s everything.
Some the, the red ones are usually the typos. And yeah, now I&#39;ll be able to send this out. So those are a few key things.
Make sure the client is correct in the aim here, making sure that the formatting is correct and fixing any typos.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5a6474760c394777ac22450337be91f2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software | Loom - 31 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So for close, what I wanted to share with you was how they do filters. And what we wanna do is try to incorporate this into the current case logs, page H.
So when I go to cases and logs on the admin portal as well as the student portal, we can select all these pre-built fields that these are fields that we provide, but they&#39;re not able to select any custom fields that they have created.
So what we want to do here is add a section to the bottom That would allow us to select custom questions.
And it could be a, a card that, like a card design. It says filter by filter custom questions. And then you can expand that.
So by default it&#39;ll be collapsed. And when it&#39;s expanded, it&#39;ll say it&#39;ll have a section a button that says select custom questions.
And then when you click on that, that&#39;ll bring up the drawer. And in the drawer we will show it similar to what close does.
So if I click leads and then add filter, so this will be like the button that&#39;s on the screen and it&#39;s gonna bring up on the right side a list of all the questions and the category of those custom questions.
So it&#39;ll be broken down by category. And you can see that here, if I see a text question, I can click on that and then I can filter the leads that contain the, the text.
So for metrics, we&#39;re not gonna get as fancy as close is because close allows me to select different types of filtering rules as say it contains exactly these words, does not contain these words.
We&#39;re gonna simply allow them to search for what contains these words. So so it&#39;ll be, if I, if I choose a text question, so in here it&#39;ll say any text.
It wouldn&#39;t say any text, it would give us the names of the questions. So it&#39;ll show, this is a checklist question.
And when I click on that checklist question, it&#39;ll bring up this and says, choose options. And it&#39;ll give me all the options that are part of that checklist and I can pick one or more.
And then I can also do a text field and then type in some text there. So now this is combining these two filters.
So I&#39;m gonna try to pull up all logs with status of one of these options and contains this random text.
So this is how our draw will work too. It&#39;ll show the custom questions by category, then each of the custom questions and I can click on it and when I click on it, it&#39;ll expand and show a way for me to select the options or type in the text.
The part we&#39;re leaving out is this fancy filter that allows us to set some criteria on how we wanna search, cuz that&#39;s very complex for us to add that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/77b0e3f293e443a4bad6c180237ab0ad</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom - Mouse Highlight Overlay - 1 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Jerry. So this is the presentation or a few slides that I put together for the team. And it came out of last week when we were at the retreat, one or two individuals kind of got me a little frustrated because it was a lot of time that we wasted talking.
Well, I would say about twen 10 to 20% of some of the group time because one person was upset at the way that someone else communicated, and then later someone else was frustrated.
And, and I mean, I&#39;ll just be very trans transparent. Maria had a drive up upstate with Chris and Rio and Chris and Rio had said some stuff.
And the whole two days we were up there Maria was upset about things. And then when we were in the office Ken said something and the whole thing was just a little frustrating for multiple individuals even to the point where Mike told me that, you know, if I had to come to the office every time every day, this is not something that I would wanna keep doing.
So the purpose of this talk is to address the concerns that I have about having certain non-work related discussions and getting upset at certain things and trying to keep it positive.
And independently of this, I&#39;m also figuring out a plan for Maria because it&#39;s, it&#39;s getting a little disruptive and distracting to have her disrupt some of the meetings and, and about certain things that is not related to work.
So that is a separate discussion. But overall I do think that if I have a good talk with everybody and kind of explain the priorities we should cut down on some of this noise that&#39;s not relevant to work.
So I wanted to start off with kind of starting with the slide that shows the picture of us at the retreat or at the house.
And then emphasizing how as a company we are, see this slide&#39;s gonna go before this. We are in a really good position and how we accomplish something that 99% of the companies does not, has not accomplished and reached that 1 million revenue last year.
And then at the same time, also emphasizing that we are at a point where there&#39;s a lot of risks in the market and it&#39;s going to be taking, it&#39;s gonna take us a lot of work to get from that 1 million to 2 million, 2 million.
And and also kind of draw on this example later, again, about a ship being in the ocean and how we have to stay focused on our goal, otherwise we&#39;re gonna sink.
So that&#39;s where we are. And in terms of embracing change, a this is a theme that has come up with these talks that we have at the office, whether we&#39;re positive or negative.
People sometimes getting frustrated with feedback they receive, or</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/510efa98627240deb9dbcb4f6573bbc5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Meeting | Microsoft Teams - 18 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So, Yeah, I, I&#39;m actually not familiar with those one either, because I think this was something that was added as a special request from Atum.
So I&#39;m assuming it was added to the backend and we haven&#39;t displayed it on the front end, so I, I, it&#39;s, yeah.
Yeah. I&#39;m gonna make a note for us to put this somewhere on the front end because it is data, but it, it probably was added because of some API integration needs into the backend and we have to display it somewhere on the Yeah, yeah.
Yep. API internal slash rotation slash user. Yeah, so, so what are you gonna do is you can download the, as a csv Yeah.
The whole thing. And you&#39;re gonna have to do a b lookup and do a update, a bulk update of that column and then re-upload that file back.
But when you re-upload, you don&#39;t use a CSV upload, you&#39;re gonna do the CSV update, so that one has the user ID and then the schedule ID is the first column.
So yeah, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a little bit, it&#39;s gonna be a little bit more tricky than that since So you, you, so you&#39;re gonna what you could do is you have the rotation id, you have the user ID and the start dates and end dates.
And then the other one has does it have the rotation id there, Let me see, Let me see that metrics ID is a student id, right?
Yeah, so, so what what you can do is so you, you wanna create a unique way to combine the data.
So the unique combination of metrics, user id, the start date, end date, and the rotation. I think there, there should be a scroll.
There has to be something here that indicates rotation cuz they core. Is that it, does that match, does that match the course ID in metrics, like if you go, let&#39;s, let&#39;s open up metrics again and then open up a new tab and we&#39;ll go, go into, actually we go to the, let&#39;s go to API and slash API internal slash rotations.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you&#39;re right. Rotations, rotation, and so this has, yeah, m e D 1 0 7 1 0 0 7, and if we download this CSV and if we download the CSV and use this to combine with this, then we could because your, your file has the rotation codes and the start date and end date and the user id, and if we combine that we can do a v lookup and get the rotation codes.
You, you can get the rotation codes into your file, the appropriate ones. Yeah, so yeah, so like on your left, on the left you have your file and the right side is the one that you just downloaded.
So what you want to do is it has the M E d Yep, yep. Course ID. And this look doing a v lookup with, with this course id, with the course code I mean the code name on the right side will let you pull the ID into the, the into the left side, you know?
Yes. Like the v lookup thing that we were talking about yesterday. So can you look on the right side and see if you can find s u r 2000?
Yeah. Yeah. So, So you, you, what we&#39;re gonna do is on the, there&#39;s, there&#39;s a few steps to, the first step would be to get the metrics rotation ID as a column on the left side, and then you can combine that rotation id, the start date, end date, and the student ID into one column as one string.
That basically becomes a unique unique key, yeah. Unique identifier. Then that, that and then on the, the one that you downloaded from the system, you could do the same thing.
You would combine the rotation id, the user ID and the starting end date, and that will be also be a unique string.
Then you can match it and fill in the the, the, the, the length. Yeah. Let, let&#39;s, let&#39;s yeah, let&#39;s do it manually for now.
And so if we do if we, yeah, so we got metrics, IDs that, and then let&#39;s look up that first row.
Let&#39;s do one row. We want the rotation ID in there. Yeah. So what, in order for it to look that up, we want to know what that first course is.
Course ID is on the left side, and then we&#39;re gonna look that up on the right side. Yep. Surgery 2000, And then on the right side you would find surgery 2000.
Okay, so surgery 2000, there&#39;s multiple ones there. And then what is the yeah, let&#39;s sort by that and then I wanna make sure we&#39;re looking at the right file.
Also, if you scroll to the right, what are the other columns on here?  Okay yeah, so this is the rotations file.
One second. We might need one more. Is there a site in there? Give me a second. Does, does your file have the rotation name on there at all, or just a code?
Because on the left side on the left side, we have the rotation the code, but we don&#39;t have the And does that hospital identify or match what&#39;s in metrics?
Yeah, there&#39;s no side id, right? Yeah, you could, you could go into a participating sites that&#39;s the, or a try social works.
Yeah, there we go. The site id. Does that match? No, I mean if you, if you look at the there&#39;s a co there&#39;s a field called site id.
Does that match what&#39;s in the file that you&#39;re looking at on the, on the, on the screen there? In, in metrics?
No bottom little lower, it says U A U C dash MS site code or site. Okay. So a site code and a rotation code combined together will give us the the unique assignment.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8e3cc29d9b214b63834b8d02862cbac4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Ops - Issues - Jira - 27 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, mark. So wanted to go over how I set up the automation so that we can copy that over. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a quick way to do this, but these are the two templates.
When I open this up, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a new rule with a name, and then I added when an issue is created an issue type equals bug description is empty.
It&#39;ll populate it with this text here. Same thing for the other one Feature template. My issue is created issue type equals feature, and right now it gets assigned to me.
We don&#39;t need to do that part. We do wanna populate it with the with the text here. I&#39;m not sure, maybe, maybe we do want to have someone assigned so that if there&#39;s something like you can be automatically assigned to you so that when the sprint planning meeting happens, you&#39;re able to pull up the ones that were assigned to you that week.
For the bugs and the feature requests. Something to think about. That&#39;s how I was, I was planning on using this assigned me field.
But it doesn&#39;t make sense for me to have that, for that to have me assigned to me, since I&#39;m not always able to make up, make make it to this print planning meeting.
So I&#39;m hoping that we can move these two templates over and then.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9d26c654d2fc4353a0e76542551f8b6c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Thank you - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 6 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, mark. I really appreciate your emails and thoughts. These are the types of conversations that are important at the stage of the company.
And some of these things I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;ll expand on as we talk more over the next few weeks. I agree with most of your points, and most importantly, I agree with the growing HR coverage as slowly as possible.
A couple things that I, I have a different perspective on is the is the fact that not having any concern about scaling.
I sent, I spend a, a large portion of my time each week managing the people aspect and their needs such as their you know, when contracts are out of date, payroll they&#39;re when there&#39;s interpersonal challenges or when people have, we don&#39;t have any policies or expectations in place.
So different individuals are following different rules when it comes to work. An example of today was you know, when Maria didn&#39;t show up for the huddle, and now I have to spend time looking to why she didn&#39;t show up.
And then other people feel, and, and, and me feel like I should be holding everybody to the same level. And these are things that happen over time because the company doesn&#39;t have written expectations and guidelines.
Yes, it doesn&#39;t you know, in, in a, in a large organization, it becomes a, a bloated entity and it&#39;s a problem at the sa at the, at a smaller level, if you don&#39;t have this in place, it, it holds the people back from doing their best work.
And right now, not having something in place is holding me from accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, which is keeping us in the black.
And there&#39;s nobody else on the team that is handling these responsibilities. Even the monthly payroll, now, it&#39;s falls on my, on my plate.
And the other thing that I want to point out here is the I agree with culture is coming from the heart, and it is a lot of work, and it comes from time spent together.
However, there, I want to draw a distinction here from culture versus team bonding. In a larger organizations, when small teams within those organizations spend time, they become more efficient and they, they get to know each other well, that&#39;s a part of culture.
That&#39;s, however at the same time, this is not the culture as a whole for an early stage company. Early stage companies is very similar to a, a, a child growing up and the parents instilling certain moral values and,  Guidelines for how they should approach the world.
And that&#39;s the same thing here. Companies an entity that people are joining and it has been intentional thing that we are focusing on.
How do we make sure the company is maturing into an organization that it&#39;s gonna take care of its people, take care of its customers, and then have that culture spread across multiple individuals.
If that is not done properly and intentionally the company will become the Microsofts of the world if it is successful and have a negative experience for these people that is why it is important for us to have these discussions and for all of us to get on the on the, on the same page about our values and what are the important things that we should be addressing for us and for the future.
And that&#39;s why I appreciated what you did yesterday where you spoke about your perspective in front of the group and in the past when things were said outside of the group in direct messages or smaller discussions, the team as a whole is not on the same page.
And then it, it, it is misaligned with what the overall decision is. So I think having these kind of open conversations and then us coming to an agreement on what is acceptable, what is unacceptable and working with someone like Maureen, she may have biased opinions about certain things.
At the same time, we have to say, this is what is important for us. This is what we need to focus on and and take in what we want, and then push back on what we don&#39;t need.
And, and she, and, and I also want us to give her a chance because I, I, I generally don&#39;t believe a quick 30 minute or 20 minute introduction is gonna give a, and into a group is gonna give us a, an assessment, each person assessment of that individual&#39;s believes and intents and what type of person they are.
It&#39;s it takes more time for that. And that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t bring her to the team until I spent four hours with her and understood how she thinks.
Anyway, so we can, we can talk more about this and I, I I already see you as a leader that the team is listening to and trusts you.
So it&#39;s important for you to have the same type of influence over the team and, and guide them in a positive direction.
So as a company matures that it, it is becoming an organization that is not like Microsoft or not like the big companies because, but there are big companies that have good culture, like, and it, it, it, it&#39;s not impossible.
And it&#39;s takes a lot of hard work. Like you, you mentioned above.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5bb4e886e0764724b2954242ff7b015a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Thank you - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 6 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, mark. I really love your email cuz I, it&#39;s allowing us to have this discussion bec and this is the type of conversations that we need to have more of, especially at the retreat, cuz it is what defines the company culture and what we believe in and what sets the foundation for growth.
So there are some things, most things in here I agree with. There are some things in here that I don&#39;t agree with and I want to point that out so that you have my perspective.
So about the HR component here. I do agree with increasing hr as slowly as possible. I am not a fan of bureaucracy, as hopefully you have realized.
At the same time, the company has as an entity and a, as a being as of its own that is taking life and starting to grow has been neglecting the needs of the people.
Because most of that work falls on me. We do not have enough people on the team with management experience or leadership experience that proactively addresses the needs of the team.
And there are multiple individuals on the team that have outdated contracts. Anytime there is we do not have any written job expectations policies.
So this means that different individuals are following different sets of expectations. Sometimes one person is taking time off by announcing in the morning that they need, they&#39;re gonna be off for the next few days and then someone else would get upset that they&#39;re allowed to do that.
And then I am playing mediator for half the day meeting with both of them and explaining why it shouldn&#39;t be done or sh and the other person why it&#39;s important that person to have that time off.
So those are the types of things that takes me away from important work that allows us to Dr. Address this thing which is being in the black, you know, multiple individuals always point out how we have to be in the black at the same time.
There&#39;s only me that can handle certain things related to people and which means that I&#39;m not selling, I&#39;m not working on, on helping onboarding and optimizing that process.
So that is a big challenge that I see with scaling. And some of these things are not visible to you because this happens directly to with me in on Slack or and, and it&#39;s not always brought up in these group meetings that we have.
And then, so the other piece here is  I agree with us having fun cuz that is really, you know, the reason I started this company cuz I love what I do here and building software designing and c causing and some disruption in, oh na, ignore that, some disruption in healthcare and, and proving their efficiency is something that is that I&#39;m passionate about.
At the same time, I do not agree with culture being a, a passive process in large organizations when there are teams.
I, what you&#39;re describing here is definitely true. When multiple individuals get together and spend time together and go through challenges, they become, they b get bonded together and they are becoming better and better as a team.
That is one part of culture. However, that&#39;s not culture at the stage that we are at. And, and culture is more intentional and I see it as more like a parent instilling morals into a child as the child is growing.
And metrics as a company is in early stages, you know, as probably like a toddler level company. This means that the people that are here that we recruit and the culture that we are building intentionally building will influence how people are treated and how internally and externally as the company matures.
And that cannot be a passive process. It has to be an active process where the leadership defines what is acceptable and not acceptable.
And this is where some of your experiences come into play, where the negative experiences that you had also plays a role in this.
Cuz that&#39;s the type of stuff that needs to be avoided. And and, and, and, but it needs to be done in a way that it&#39;s, it&#39;s with that, that doesn&#39;t create fear because that also stops creativity.
And I think that is where you are, what I see your potential.  David Kapa, for example, was able to point out problems and that are legitimate to individuals, but was not able to have that conversation with the team and influence them in a, in an how do we go into the positive direction which created fear.
But what you did yesterday where you brought up your concern and we had a conversation about it and we say, let&#39;s give her a chance, you know, and, and, and see if if we explore her capabilities and then give her a chance.
And, and if you had that yesterday when you, when you ma brought that up, one of, I&#39;m, I&#39;m not sure if you noticed both Ken and Rio, both of both individuals who have been somewhat excited about having Maureen there, started to sa say the same thing that you said, which, which is, which I want you to pay attention to because they see you as a leader.
And when they saw your assessment of it, they also started saying the same thing. And if that assessment is not fully formed and, and, and, and, and from a deep understanding of the problem, or giving Maureen a chance or someone else a chance or idea, a chance, it can it can stop us from doing, accomplishing certain things.
So I am confident that with the way that you communicate, you have the ability to influence the team and build the positive side while also avoiding some of the negative things that you have seen.
And if we do that now as the company grows, hopefully more and more team members will have a positive experience.
So, and then the other thing that I wanted to point out here was I do, I I I&#39;ll, I I think for you may have talked to Maria about this, about David&#39;s what you say here, something that I, I had a conversation with Maria about the, there is a part of this that I haven&#39;t really shared with everybody and it&#39;s not, the reason I feel that David got burnt out was because of some of the challenges or some of the, some of the things that he was told after meetings or decisions were made that made him feel like he is not delivering value.
And for example Michigan State, I see that I saw that opportunity as a way for us to set a foundation for U M E and spend enough time ensuring that we do a good job and, and build a foundation for u e.
And that&#39;s exactly what has been happening. We&#39;re getting more larger organizations. However, he after these meetings, you know I had, I had these kinds of things brought up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a77b640adff14baf8ba14a1b3ab6bb4f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 27 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So I am investigating a bug here. Take a look at Henry Ford. And if we look at one of the students on this schedule that&#39;s on the block schedule audit report, you can see we have Kirby from January 2nd to January 29th.
January 2nd to January 29th. What I wanna do is delete this entry and confirm that it shows up on the audit report cuz client has reported that it&#39;s not showing up.
So delete this. So now that&#39;s gone. I go back to this page refresh. This is still showing up here as an edit.
So as of right now, this schedule, this item is not on the schedule anymore and it&#39;s still showing up here as edited.
And the new log of where is deleted is not showing up. Let&#39;s try filtering no deletes. So we gotta make sure that the delete action is also captured here when a schedule is removed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3d5d5b94614f4c4ab0299599c9217869</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Thank you - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 6 January 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning, mark. Thank you for writing this out. I really enjoy these conversations cuz these are the types of discussions that are important at the early stages of a company.
And it&#39;s it&#39;s also important for both of us to get on the same page about how we lead the team.
Cuz even though you&#39;re new to the team, you have a great influence on their work as well as how they perceive certain things that are new.
So I wanna kind of go through a follow a few of these. I agree with most of them. There&#39;s a couple of things that I disagree with and I want to explain what I mean about the the hr component.
The, I agree with your assessment here about hr having worked at big organizations, myself and hospitals. Yes, this is exactly that.
The, the, the truth about those kinds of work HR departments. At the same time, there is also a need for us to address certain things, and a lot of these things are falling into my plate right now.
And it&#39;s getting ignored. And then, and this is also hurting the team&#39;s ability to do what needs to be done.
And it&#39;s not possible for me to make the time with two jobs and a and a baby to make sure that the needs of all the team members are met.
And I&#39;ll give you some examples of these things. I started writing down such as like contracts. There are multiple individuals with outdated contracts.
There are we don&#39;t have any written policies or expectations, which means that different team members follow different sets of guidelines.
And for example, sometimes people take multiple days off last minute, and then other people are upset about having to make up the work.
And then I spend half my day addressing that with two different individuals and make sure that they&#39;re both happy. Another thing is there are certain challenges working as a small team remotely where someone says something and someone else gets upset on Slack.
And this also becomes a challenge where there&#39;s lost productivity, where it&#39;s, it becomes a something that I have to intervene.
This happens at least once or twice a month, and there&#39;s not really anyone else besides me that can intervene on these things and make sure the team is operating as a unit.
And this, this is, I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not saying this says something bad, any small team will have these issues. At the same time, it&#39;s Also important for me to make sure that I&#39;m focusing on that things that will a address this big concern of getting in the black as soon as possible.
This is something that David Kapa used to always mention and point out to everybody how companies running outta money at the same time.
There&#39;s, it needs to be what is a solution? It&#39;s, it&#39;s a, you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s only possible for certain things to be done with certain amount of time.
So as a team is growing it, it is important for us to have make sure that the people that are coming here and as a job has stability and someone they can rely on for having their voice heard and and advocate for them.
And I don&#39;t always have the time for that. And there&#39;s a whole side of the business that you maybe not be seeing since your interaction with them is limited.
And, and it is, it eats up a lot of my time. And while I at, at, at the same time, I, I am a hundred percent with you on this part, growing the HR coverage as slowly as possible because I don&#39;t like bureaucracy.
And, and the reason that I am building the company the way it is, is to minimize that so that people have the capacity to do their best work and not, not be caught up with red tape.
And, and that is only possible if there&#39;s also that safety that comes with certain things that, that an employee needs.
And it, it&#39;s especially important for people that are earlier in their career, they may not exactly know what they need and, and it&#39;s important for the company to proactively provide that someone like you know exactly what you need and you&#39;ve been to different organizations and what your work is gonna be like so you know what your needs are.
That&#39;s not the same for those are that are earlier in their career. And then the other thing that I agree with is well, I, I definitely agree with this number one requirement of having fun because you&#39;re not gonna have any positive influence on anybody unless you&#39;re also having fun.
The the the part that I disagree with is that culture comes from within teams and not having shared objectives. That&#39;s something is maybe true in a larger organization.
And I think what you&#39;re addressing there is bonding between team members. And when you&#39;re in a larger team and you have common challenges, you bond with those team members.
That Is one part of culture. However, that&#39;s not the entire thing. Culture is also having a common goal that everybody&#39;s working towards.
And, and speaking about like from a, a battle perspective, there are if a, if the leadership of a, a unit is given clear direction on what the objective is and why they&#39;re fighting for something, they&#39;re much more likely to be successful than if they are fighting for the, you know, not having clear objectives.
So, and, and it&#39;s also ties into you know, sort of like a company being a, a, a a six person company, being a toddler or a child that is growing up to be a mature company.
If you, if you are given that company proper guidance and objectives and morals, then that company will mature into an organization that will not have those the, those negative qualities that has influenced multiple members of the team in large corporations.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ea28f6dd211d4efaa7b09661d83e455a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>GrowthOps Board Introduction</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to use growth ops and assign tasks to different team members. So growth ops can be found under projects, growth ops, and when we are on this page, there are multiple views that we can use.
The summary view gives you a snapshot of everything. The board view gives you a breakdown of the task with different statuses to do in progress.
Two days priority and done. And there are some filters up here, so if you want to see all the ones that are assigned to you, you could do that.
All the ones that are due this week, you could do that. And then there&#39;s a more filters to apply. More filters.
List view shows all of the tasks in list view, and this can be expanded and collapsed if there&#39;s sub-task. And we can also click on a person to see their task.
There&#39;s a search at the top, and there&#39;s also a create button for creating new tasks at the bottom. The calendar view shows you any deadlines, timeline view shows you a can chart forms from skipping pages.
This is where we look at our huddle Issues, is a more advanced page where we can actually pull in issues from multiple, multiple projects.
So if I wanted to see projects, I mean a task or issues from multiple boards, I can use that to filter in here.
I can also build in more advanced search, just, so let&#39;s say I want to find all the in-progress tasks for Chris, none of them.
Let&#39;s try me. And then I can also assign it based, I mean do more complex queries like due dates being within a certain range.
So those are the major task management or filtering tools. So if you want to create a new task, click create.
And when we create that, you, you want to enter the summary. Always be descriptive with the summary so that everybody can look at it and know what it, what, what it the task is for.
So for example, if it&#39;s for a client, you can use a client&#39;s name in the name, in the summary. So like M S U indicates that it&#39;s for at Michigan State University.
And then the task, And then we come down the due date. Always add a due date. Whenever we create a task, write the description.
A lot of times we create videos like this using Loom when we need to explain more complex ideas into the description and always assign this test attached to somebody else.
And if you cannot ask, assign it to somebody else, leave it assigned to you and it can be moved over later when someone is available to take that.
And as we come down, there&#39;s large, small and medium priorities or effort level. We could choose that large, smaller, medium if we know that, if you know, if you know it&#39;s gonna be large, smaller, medium, otherwise we can leave it blank.
And then ASI updated later. So once an issue is added, it can be managed on this view. I can change the due date, I can change the assignee and I can also see who reported it.
So if I added it, I&#39;ll be the reporter. If I assigned it to someone, that person will be the, the assignee and I can click on particular issue to see more details.
There&#39;s a way to attach files I can update the status. And the most important status that we used on a daily basis is today&#39;s priority.
So if I put something as status as today&#39;s priority, it&#39;ll show up in this huddled list. So if we go to the huddle, we have two sections for each person.
So, Tosh, yesterday, this shows me all the tasks that were marked as done in the last 24 hours. And if I go to today, it&#39;ll show me all the tasks with the status of today&#39;s priority.
So if we know that we&#39;re gonna work on it, we wanna put that as today&#39;s priority. So this has been a quick overview of the growth ops board.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d825b5fac08a4a539be4bb97da39cd15</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>RUSVM - COURSES (2022-08-22) - Sem 7 Schedule details for eValue dd August 22.xlsx - Google Sheets - 21 December 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Kumi, we&#39;ve been trying to get this working and so far trying various combination. I think we&#39;re identified. We have identified the I think we have identified the problem and it, it seems like when we were running it the team was commenting out different slots for physical one, physical two, and anesthesia one.
Cuz there is a rule that says all students have to be scheduled for physical one and anesthesia one before any student can be scheduled for physical two and anesthesia two.
So all of them have to complete it before physical one and physical two. We&#39;ve been trying to get that accomplished by commenting out the second half of physical one and second first half of physical two, and then second half of physical, of anesthesia one and first half of anesthesia two.
And by adjusting this, we were able to get a solution.  But we couldn&#39;t, like for example, you can see that we have week, week six on anesthesia one and we have to have week six of physical two.
So there are different combinations that is getting a result, but I think this is best handled as a constraint so that we can uncommon all of them and then have a constraint that says two courses, physical one and physical two has to be fully scheduled for all students before any of the anesthesia two and physical two and anesthesia two can be scheduled.
So that way we don&#39;t have to manually comment these out. And I&#39;m thinking maybe that will make a difference. So I was wondering if it&#39;s possible for us to add that and if it&#39;s a quick change that we can do.
So let me know how, what your thoughts are. Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cbc5cfa0d16d4650b743d27cb6545527</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>[DV-486] Outbound &gt; Audience settings - Add ability to use user Roles as an AND on top of already selected audience values [HIGH] - Jira - 9 February 2023</pre></td><td><pre>All right.

And I&#39;m gonna open up each of them, describe the title and description, and you can polish it up and write up a nice summary so that Mike can ta take that and put together a newsletter that we can send out to the clients.
So the first one here. So this new feature for our outbound module will allow the customers to target email notifications to specific individuals based on their role so that any low score or poor performance on evaluations can be targeted to specific individuals in the organization.
And we expanded on the, the audience capabilities so that you can apply multiple filters and send out very targeted emails to specific members of the or the leadership based on their their responsibilities for managing the organization.
And then the other piece here is we can also put a summary of what the outbound module is. The outbound module is a advanced notification system that organizations can use to build custom alerts or emails, email notifications based on their business rules.
So these are more advanced email notifications than what we have standard as part of the platform.

And we&#39;ve heard too, I heard too many times when we kind of do an analysis of what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not kind of a retrospective I&#39;m like, I think people generally understand it, but it&#39;s, it, it does have some inherent complexity that requires you to model yeah.
Uh, all the time. This does, you can model of course, but now you can model very, like you said, specifically.
Yeah. So that&#39;s kind of how that works. The same thing here. I mean, these are the, these are the same use cases that we see all the time as to why people wanna get the capital on board.
Um, and then take advantage of opportunities when they arise and be ready for, for the rainy day or the, or the, or the sunshine.
Yeah. Yeah. So I think, uh, this definitely is interesting. And, um, um, what, uh, I, I, I have to wait to hear from this current discussion with, uh, this, um, and, um, so I, I, let me see the next meeting with them is in a couple of weeks.
Okay. Um, Yeah. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s totally understandable to prioritize that and run that, run that to ground and see where that ends up.
Yeah. Just know, and, and you may want to focus on that one versus parallel tracking, um, with us, but it&#39;s up to you.
We&#39;re, we&#39;re more than ready. Our team&#39;s 25 strong now, so we have the capacity to, to move, um, to move forward and, and explore this further.
Um, I&#39;ll wait for your Signal. Is there, is there, um, a way to get an AC a definite number? Like how much we are allowed to draw and, um, yeah.
Yeah. I can, I can speak to that. The way that we can get to that answer would be for you to complete a, an application, essentially.
Yeah. We&#39;ve, We&#39;ve got most of the information. Um, but I think it would probably take you about 30 minutes. Okay.
Um, for you to, for you or, or, or David to complete that, then we could really look at, it may take us a week or two, it might take us a little bit longer than usual to kind of figure out the structure of how we would refinance your current deal.
Yeah. Um, but I think we could start that if you want to get that and parallel track this so that in the event that the discussions don&#39;t, uh, come to anything fruitful in the short term with this, uh, company.
Yeah. You&#39;ve already got this going. You don&#39;t have to do everything sequentially, but I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll leave that up to you.
I don&#39;t know what else you&#39;ve got going, but I don&#39;t think the lift on your end or David&#39;s is gonna be like huge.
We&#39;ve streamlined a lot of our process. Do we have to pay 5k to figure out how much? No. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay. It would only be a close if you actually literally like close the deal. Okay. Um, so yeah, there&#39;s no cost to explore this.
Of course. Okay. Yeah. So then I would say, um, we can fill out the application and so that we can compare, um, well, not necessarily even compare it&#39;s, I&#39;m, I&#39;m looking at just at a, um, how much they&#39;re gonna put in versus how much, uh, uh, we can do as a yeah.
Non-equity Uh, yeah. And another, and sometime mean you could even look at it differently. And another alternative is like, you look at both.
Yeah. Um, uh, it doesn&#39;t have to be a major complication. It could be like, yeah, I wanna, I want to capitalize the company in a way where I&#39;ve got 18 months or more of visibility now.
Yeah. Or whatever it is that would be meaningful to you that may open up your capital strategy in a way that could lead to something nice outcomes.
Yeah. Yeah. To, so just another alternative and it&#39;s nice. A lot of companies are doing that right now. They&#39;re, they&#39;re going back to existing investors typically, and they&#39;re, they&#39;re doing a safe or something like that.
And then they&#39;re, but they&#39;re, they&#39;re bolting onto that, like what we provide and it&#39;s giving them some nice capital to get through easily the next 18 months should, should things get Rocky or in some cases they&#39;re like, I know there&#39;s gonna be opportunities to either get really good talent.
Yeah. Um, from, from competitors or otherwise. And I just want to be capitalized properly so that I don&#39;t have to be like, oh, now I need to go raise.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, Okay. Well I will, I will get the, the, the application process moving. I&#39;ll copy David on that.
If you wanna let him know that. Yeah. You&#39;re gonna explore this a little further. I did have a note that last time, I think, uh, Ben Franklin, there was some issues with the subordination.
Yeah. Um, I don&#39;t know if we can cross that bridge when we get there, unless you think we should start there.
Um, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s gonna happen with the Ben Franklin. I, I, I don&#39;t, it, it, we still haven&#39;t heard, uh, anything from them and right.
It&#39;s possible that they don&#39;t wanna subordinate and that&#39;s, uh, that&#39;s probably why they haven&#39;t responded to us. Um, and so that if that&#39;s gonna be a, a requirement for this, then it probably is good to start there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a4cdb4fdce72400ba1d4ccc9e2023498</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Martha</pre></td><td><pre>It energy lab. And it is that experience in the decade between that will put, bring to life investor grade emissions data, because we see it as exactly that intersection of data that&#39;s on energy, invoices and utility bills and what investors need.
So if you are a CFO today, you&#39;ve got these four forces coming right at you. And I know the us has just had some Supreme court decisions that might say, Hey, you&#39;re not going to regulate anything anymore, but actually there&#39;s many more demands that are driving the constant pressure at this point for ESG and emissions data.
And as you can see from one of the leading supply chain, data providers, chief procurement officers and CFOs are saying, this is invariant to the recession.
If you are that CFO, you have a problem because the leading sustainability and carbon accounting software tools don&#39;t produce data, they say, upload your CSV.
And we work with four or five like Salesforce per Stephanie, IBM on this chart. And they don&#39;t have data. We provide it to them.
And we did a survey in Q1 of 300, uh, sustainability and carbon accounting software tools. If I could find it, we went and found out how they got their data.
And very few of them, um, create data in any way. Most of them are recycling industry averages and government estimates.
And in fact, EOI survey shows that only 9% of companies actually even use software. Everybody&#39;s using manual data entry on spreadsheets.
So the CFO has a big problem, not only in finding data, but if you&#39;re reporting data under Sarbanes Oxley, which is known as Sox in the U S your, your individual risk is high because under that law, the CFO, um, does not have protection from the company if they are personally responsible for any data omissions and glitches.
So if you&#39;re not bringing in data to that process, you have a outstanding liability in that process. And as you can see, the spring SAP announced they&#39;re expanding their ERP system to a green ledger, which means it&#39;s going to hold this data it&#39;s ready to receive.
And we say that over and over and other enterprise software, we are working with Salesforce and they&#39;re telling us that data is their biggest problem in this area.
So the CFO has no software and a data problem. That&#39;s what Glen solves. And we solve it in a particular way because the most of the data that&#39;s needed for emissions reporting by companies is locked up in documents like these utility bills and energy invoices from around the world.
And if you can see that there&#39;s a enormous variation, it&#39;s a semantic, um, sort of mess, and that everything&#39;s stepping on each other.
And it&#39;s pretty hard to not only get the data off the document accurately, but untangle it and give it the common meaning.
So that&#39;s what we do where the we&#39;re the enterprise platform that produces this high quality data that&#39;s investor grade. And that means it&#39;s auditable.
It&#39;s accurate. Um, we have scripts to normalize things. And so it&#39;s a code based data pipeline. We do create a assuming we do collect data from business invoices, you waste bills, utility bills.
And we actually also log in to utility sites on behalf of our customers around the world. That&#39;s where the market is today.
Adding, uh, API APIs from satellite data is that comes through in the next year and a half. Uh, we can, we have integrated IOT sensors and we can use engineering estimates.
This gives you all the data you need for sites. And there&#39;s going to be a second part of this story, which is the supply chain, but this is the underlying engine that provides the data for sites and a little bit of a peek into our experience and the tech so far users.
This is data as a service and we have good economics. So we&#39;re able to reduce their expenses by 70% while providing a better product, their current systems being manual data entry and spreadsheets.
And as you can see, we have an automated pipeline with advanced machine learning. And what&#39;s particularly cool about our machine learning that we built is in this world.
And, you know, you&#39;ll see that CVRE is one of our customers in this world. Data is hard to get for training of AI.
Nobody&#39;s going to give you 50 to 100 samples of anything. They only have five or six. And so we built a machine learning system that says, you tell me what you got.
We&#39;ll give you highly accurate data, you know, in four to six documents with minimal training. And so we&#39;re bootstrapping everybody from their starting place to full automation.
Now, as I mentioned, the story is building here. So we have a missions by site and we have the technology platform to produce it.
And that&#39;s solving the CFO managing major problem today, but everybody has a supply chain problem. And typically supply chain emissions are 60% of that, that needs to be reported.
So it&#39;s a pretty high number, but you don&#39;t control your suppliers, but there&#39;s an information architecture solution, which is my, if I&#39;m this buyer, my supply chain emissions originate from my suppliers, their emissions, and there&#39;s an overlap between their site level emissions and my supply chain emissions.
We use that overlap to expand our footprint and solve the supply chain problem. And we&#39;re doing a pilot on that this summer with some of the leading supply chain portals.
And in that pilot, the buyer asked the supplier for their site level emissions who they, and they in turn ask their suppliers for site level and Glint.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/feb39a26332a4c069f3000bedcd222c4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 25 August 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys.

So this section will only appear if the program has at least one rotation evaluation template. So if I go to templates and I have least one rotation evaluation template, that&#39;s active, we&#39;ll have this section up here and inside of this section, we&#39;ll have some texts and then list out each of those rotations and each of those rotation templates.
And then if I turn these checkboxes on what we&#39;re going to do is add those rotations to this part too.
So let&#39;s say I, Um, did not have cardiology here and I was adding a new cardiology rotation. Um, I don&#39;t want to come back to this page and add this manually.
This feature is giving them the option to connect the rotation that I&#39;m creating to the templates that are already exist, so they don&#39;t forget to do it.
So we&#39;re simply listing out those templates and then turning this on. We&#39;ll add that rotation to this list and have it as added.
And there&#39;s also a link. If I click on this, this will open up this page, um, in a new tab.
So we&#39;re gonna open up that template in the new tab. There&#39;s also the, this link here. This will open up the entire templates page in a new tab.

That explains what the report is. When we open up, um, the course summary report, we can see that it allows the admin to select a academic period and select one or more courses.
And If we look at the, um, I believe it&#39;s the session, schedule it export. It has a similar interface like this, and you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a view tree selector we&#39;re using for courses.
So you can select multiple courses at one time. And when we click this generate email report, it&#39;s going to send, Um, let me the button should be Standard button color.
So it will email the report to the administrator who click the button. The actual report itself is going to contain these columns.
So we have the act academic levels, academic period, course name Of course, name course code, Uh, session, title, session, description, session type.
So if we look at the curriculum and go to courses, We&#39;re pulling the course name, course code academic levels. And then for each of the course, we&#39;re summarizing what data is part of that.

I found this old U us similarly documents from our previous discussion and wanted to create a video that explains how to turn it into a format that metrics can understand.
So if we look at this document, we have categories up here and keywords. Um, so we can look at this document in couple of ways, the keywords, um, my recommendation is actually to use these bold texts as keywords and metrics, and then use these additional phrases as descriptors.
That way it&#39;s easier for faculty and others to select the keyword. If you have it too granular, it becomes difficult for them to pick and choose the specific keyword that applies to a session or, or a, uh, a lecturer lab.
And also it makes it not very useful for reporting. Um, and yet when you have it too granular, but if we use these as the key words, then, and put these as descriptors, faculty can choose the appropriate keyword and B and be, uh, uh, aware that any of these topics under that keyword should be classified as biochemistry and molecular biology.
So if we go with that idea, the categories here would be general principles of foundational science. And I can take that.
Copy it. We&#39;re going to go to this template here. So this is a metrics import template, and there&#39;s an ID field, a column ID column, keyword column, keyword category, and description.
So the ID, we can number them, uh, incrementally from 1, 2, 1, 2, how many keywords there are? So we&#39;ll just 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 keywords.
We&#39;re going to copy that in a second. We&#39;ll start with category here. Be general principles of foundational science. And if you go back here, biochemistry and molecular biology would be the first keyword Next, we have biology of cells And it will be part of the same category.
That&#39;s for the description and copy this whole block of texts. And this is optional. If you want to include it in metrics, otherwise he can, uh, stick to the key words and this document can be given to the faculty for reference, but let&#39;s say, if you want to import it something we can paste here, Biology of cells, And then The text for this.
And we would go through the full document, creating these keywords so that that&#39;s our recommendation. If you want to get down to the individual Granular elements here, it is possible for you to make this the category and then put these as key words.
But oftentimes it becomes too much for the faculty to pick and choose every single keyword in here. Um, and if you, if you want to go that route, it is possible as long as there&#39;s enough faculty development, make sure they&#39;re all aware of how to, how to use that in that, in that scenario, you would turn these bold phrases into categories, and then each of these Items in here as keywords.
So those are two ways that we can, uh, turn this into keywords. I&#39;ll send a PDF, which you already have along with the keywords that I&#39;ve entered here as a sample.
And, uh, you can let me know if you have any questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f9d472ead36e4136a94610b4a1ba2c60</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Jira Update - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail - 18 July 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Libby. I started writing out the answers. Uh, then I decided would be better for me to explain it. So I was getting, uh, it&#39;d be faster to go through this and a video.
Uh, I love your message. By the way, I was very happy to see this. This is the type of exactly the type of work and help that I need, um, to grow the business, um, prioritization, I can help do this.
And, uh, I&#39;d love to get some feedback on how to do this since different individuals are going to be working on this.
Should I create a separate list for each person, or should I create some sort of ranking for each one, like high, medium, or low, and then, uh, use that system for breaking down the epics into epics, into stories.
What I&#39;m more interested is helping the team learn how to do this on their own so that they can get better at managing their own work.
So I love this exercise and maybe what we can do is ask each person to look at their list of, um, Epics or okay, ours, and then pick one and bring to a meeting where we go through creating stories for one epic for each of the team members this way, they, they have a idea of how to do this, and then they go, they can go back and work with each other to create the rest of the stories for the epics, and then come back to you with, for feedback.
And then you, you can have one-on-one meetings or group meetings to go over the ones that they worked on on their own.
Let me know what your thoughts are. And, um, we can get a, meet the initial meeting on the calendar to do the first step.
So please use my calendar to schedule a meeting, to go over the questions, the ownership, and the scheduling, those something.
Those are the three items we can discuss in a call as for the technical depth. We can also go through that in a meeting.
However, I want to provide some context for your meeting with Mark. So we&#39;ve been using, um, get lab for any tasks that is ready to be worked on.
We, after specs are written or design is added, things are added to get lab before it&#39;s, before that it&#39;s tracked in product board or some other spreadsheet.
However, what happens is as priorities changed because of client issues, some of these things get stuck in here, and we have some issues.
For example, there&#39;s a board called David&#39;s pit. That&#39;s been sitting around for a long time. There&#39;s some other things in these testing it&#39;s been sitting around for a long time.
So what we need to do is anything that&#39;s been started. We need to finish up. That&#39;s what I&#39;m considering technical debt in this context.
Um, I know there&#39;s a larger technical debt related to things that we need to address as a system at code base.
Uh, but in this context, I&#39;m talking about finishing up anything that we started so we can start clean with sprints.
Um, so when you talk to, um, mark, we need to plan the sprints in a way that we are finishing up what we already started and then also incorporating new eyes, new items.
And then in terms of setting up, um, JIRA for development, a couple of things that I wanted to point out here is in get lab.
We&#39;ve been using different types of tags for tracking different types of work. So for example, if it&#39;s a bug it&#39;s labeled a bug, if it&#39;s a critical bug or a critical feature, it has a critical label.
That means that the developers needs to know they are prioritizing that, um, over other items. So if they&#39;re working on a non-critical item and then see a new critical item coming up into the queue, they will drop their regular work and pick up that critical item.
First, there&#39;s also tags that we&#39;re using for clients. This tag, these clients, tags are used when the work is being done specifically for an implementation project.
So this is not a, um, so we, when, whenever we&#39;re doing a large implementation, we may come into features that we are missing.
Um, so we commit to do that as part of the implementation process. And that&#39;s when we tag them, or this is something that is being addressed specifically for a client, and we need to know that we need to communicate back with them.
So I, it would be useful in JIRA for us track this client list and then be able to tag an issue, um, as a client issue, we can use that for, for the huddle as well as the development board.
And then we also have different module tags. So this is saying that this is for the requirements, module schedules, module, curriculum module.
So that&#39;s something that we would also want to track in JIRA. So, um, so would be great for us to meet later this week about these number three, number four, number five and number six.
Um, and for the, and you can use my, you can use my calendar calendar to schedule that, um, for this one, we can schedule a meeting with the entire team and, um, I think probably Thursday, maybe a good time for that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1dffdc38ea894f028f7e110dacb2d07c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 23 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys, for this particular task, we&#39;re going to be adding a new widget to the student dashboard here. This is going to only apply to the student portal and it&#39;s going to only appear if the setting is turned on under system set up settings on a person on the program portal, we will have the setting under cases, and if it&#39;s turned on, we&#39;ll have this widget appear.
The widget is going to have two fields here. Um, actually let&#39;s copy this here. Okay. Sure Mike&#39;s going to look at, make it look a little better.
Um, essentially, we&#39;re going to give them the ability to run this widget based on a grade course rotation or date range.
Let&#39;s review the setup here in metrics. We have, um, rotations which are under system set up for rotations, and these rotations can be linked to graded grade book rotations.
So under grade book set up, we can create these rotations and have the system set up. Rotation records be linked to this.
So you may have multiple regular rotations being linked to the same graded course rotations for case logs. When someone submits a case, it includes a case state as well as a linked to the rotations.
The users that submit the case logs are also linked to the rotation via user schedule. So what we are doing here is either giving them the ability to select a graded course rotation or select a date range.
If I select a course, again, this is a graded course rotation and click calculate. It&#39;s going to look up all the cases, all the cases that are linked to rotations that are linked to graded course rotation that I selected.
And it gives me the total number of cases, total number of minutes and total number of hours. And this is, uh, the minutes come from the case duration field on the case log.
So case all case log that are being submitted as a case duration field. And we&#39;re telling up that number of minutes to get this, and we&#39;re converting that to our hours by dividing it by 60 here.
So the first option is select the greater course rotation. It will retrieve all the case logs that are linked to rotations that are linked to the greater course rotation I selected and generate the tally.
Then if I click view details, it&#39;ll bring up a model here. This shows the graded course rotation, total number of hours for that total number of minutes, total number of cases.
And then I click expand this list out all the rotations, the site that is linked to the preceptors that are part of that.
And then the total hours and minutes for, um, this particular rotation. And we can also show the total cases here to The second option we have here is select date range.
If I select a specific date range and click calculate is going to retrieve all the cases from that day range gives me the total number of minutes from case duration convert into hours.
And then I click view details. And this here, we&#39;re going to show all of the graded course rotations from that date range, click expand and it&#39;ll show all the rotations.
So again, you look at this, This greater course rotation is what we have listed as a header. And these rotations that are linked to it are going to be these rotations that we see under it.
So Just put this here. So the, So at the top are the graded course rotations. And then Inside of it are all the rotations that are linked to the grade of course, rotations.
So hope that helps let us know if you have any questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b98a1b27bde6440191e3f63b39ff9126</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 13 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So the purpose of this task is to create a more advanced search functionality for curriculum. And if we look at our evaluations page here, we have lots of filters that allows us to bring in any type of evaluation assignment.
Same thing. If I go to the logs page, I have lots of filters here that allows me to bring in different types of cases while we want to do here is on the search page, redo the search page in a way that allows us to search the entire curriculum for all different types of sessions.
So Mo using the phone, uh, the filter design we have for cases and evaluation assignments. We want to update, to have one search page with a bunch of filters that for example, things like having, um, a way to filter by all of the different fields that we have here.
So I can choose the session type and show all sessions of the simulation across all courses, or I can type in and search for one or more different codes.
I can type in the title into a field, another field, and then search for a specific, uh, uh, titles. I can have another field core leaders and select a person, one or more people, and it&#39;ll show all the sessions with those of them as leaders, another field for themes.
And it&#39;ll all be a view tree select that lists out the themes I can select one or more teams and I&#39;ll bring up those.
Or I can say a date range that says session dates within and have a start date and end date. And it will show all the sessions within those dates.
I can select groups and show me all the, um, sessions that have that group or, um, a venue and show me all of the sessions with that venue.
And, uh, we always want to allow multi-select and most of these are going to be beauty selects that we use.
Then key words, select, um, from a view tree select one or more key words, and it&#39;ll show all the keywords, all the sessions with that key word content.
So we can have three drop, three drop-downs, one for instructional methods and other one for assessment methods and resources. And then if I search it&#39;ll bring me all the sessions with those content associated with it, and we could also have a dropdown, for course, and I can choose one or more course, and I&#39;ll bring me all the sessions with those courses, that sessions for those courses, um, and objectives also.
So I can select, um, objective codes. I, it search for a biopsy of one, a more objective codes, and then it&#39;ll bring, um, sessions that are with those codes or a bunch of key, uh, just text.
And I&#39;ll bring me all the sessions with those that text in its objectives. So it&#39;s a pretty, it&#39;s going to be an advanced search page, and eventually we should be able to get rid of all of these multiple tabs and just have one robust search where we can do any type of search for any type of session.
And the table is going to be, Um, similar to this where we can have all types of information about the session and then we&#39;ll be able to click on it and view more details.
Um, so for example, if I go to the sessions page, sorry, search page, and I search for sessions, I can bring up a table here So we can probably model it after this here.
Um, cause you can then click on the course session name. So, So in order to work on this task, the best thing to do is look at all this, look at all the sessions, look at all effort and see all the ways that you can add data into the system.
And then we want to think about how to build those filters so that it&#39;s allows us to bring in data based on what we need.
So here, for example, to and from dates for the cases similar to this, the other one is going to be two and from dates for the sessions scheduled dates, we can even have a, a M date range for when it was last edited.
It&#39;s another, it&#39;s another, not a nice thing to have. So the goal is to make it so simple that if someone is looking for anything in the session, they can quickly find it.
So they don&#39;t have to go sort of opening up different courses and look for different things. It&#39;s all searchable similar to the way that we do for logs and evaluations.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9649a8368b72446c95580476103fea7b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE - Gradeblock - Google Docs - 18 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey marina. So this is going to be a bit of a tricky task. Um, what we&#39;re trying to do is create A document that&#39;s similar to this, where, uh, and this is going to involve multiple tasks, but in this particular task, what we&#39;re trying to do is create this section here, where we&#39;re inserting grades for multiple courses into this document.
We can skip this chart for now, but this is going to be about inserting these texts from the grade book.
So if I look at Our grade book here, as part of the grade book set up, we can insert different courses or rotations into the grade book set up, and these are created here and they can read linked to other rotations in the system.
But this great book itself has a place that we can create these rotations and we call them graded course rotations.
And what happens is once these graded courses, that rotations are created, I can go into the system and I can add grades for them.
So let&#39;s say if I select a person here, I can select anatomy and the date that I&#39;m inserting it, and I can link this to a schedule And then the number of weeks.
Great. Uh, And it also put a comment here, Save comment, good grade. I&#39;m missing something here. I don&#39;t know what that is.
We don&#39;t have any great time to me. That&#39;s probably why can&#39;t save it. But the idea here is that I can save this grade and link it to a great course rotation that I created.
What we&#39;re trying to do now is let&#39;s say if I entered grades for all three courses or all three rotations, I want to create a document that contains all three.
But The tricky thing here is these students may take these courses in any order. So we want this to be inserted dynamically so that we can insert them in the appropriate order.
So what I&#39;m doing here is under, um, documents and templates. I&#39;ve created a template here for a new type of merge field is going to be called great block.
It&#39;s going to be an open and a close, similar to like an HTML open and close, or in a Django template.
We have an open-end close tag. And as part of the open tag, we&#39;re going to write in the code of the graded course rotations.
So in this case, I let&#39;s say if I want to put all three of the graded course rotations, I have, I created three.
Let&#39;s say that 10 of them, I can put all three of 10 of them, or I can just put five of them.
And the idea is that if I have them inserted, When this document is generated, it&#39;s going to look at the grade book and pull these other fields for each of those Courses that I have here.
So it&#39;s going to take everything that&#39;s in here And repeat it three times since I have three courses in here.
So it would look like Something like this. It would look like this, but with the table also, and all the information filled in.
So let&#39;s take a look at one at a time. So let&#39;s say if I want to put in, Um, generate this document for the first course anatomy 1 0 1, it&#39;s going to pull in the great, great book, graded course rotation name.
So that&#39;s going to be, If I enter a score here, this is going to be the name of the graded course rotation.
So that&#39;s going to be anatomy. If it&#39;s for the first one and a anatomy one-on-one for the clerkship grade is going to pull in The status, This field For, I&#39;m going to skip over all grade for now For great book weeks.
It&#39;s going to pull in Weeks here Then for Schedule start schedule. And It&#39;s going to look at Either, it&#39;s going to put, it&#39;s going to put select the, um, let&#39;s put in, whereas it in here, I mean, a student here, you can see the student who was scheduled for infectious disease from July for 21st to July 29th.
And it&#39;s going to pull in the start date here and the end date. So it was going to put, start date, end date, And then schools.
This, This is going to be linked to a particular site. Infectious disease is going to be linked to a particular site, and we&#39;re going to take that And insert it At site graded schedule site.
And We can also pull in The city and state for that site. So we&#39;ll put Comma Hoppy, this code Teddy, And then gradebook revised comment is going to be the revised comment field that was added here.
So essentially what we&#39;re going to do is loop through all three courses and insert the content and create three tables with the content filled in from the grade book.
And this happens when we go into the System, go to documents, Templates, And we&#39;re going to click a MSP template.
Well, I select someone I click create document Edit. Now it should, what it should have done is actually put in And One Should retain the formatting also Honors For It&#39;s going to be From this.
Why you Okay, great. Well, it&#39;s going to that&#39;s. That would be what it looks like for anatomy one-on-one and then it would make This do Really, But notice how we were to generate this document.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7e20c9bd90ce4b14b8e02c5d05e6b623</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Message - 22 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this is a bug that&#39;s happening on The system where, um, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just happening on Kaiser, but the best way to test this is to pull the KP database And look at this user Mariah Allen.

I wanted to create this video to go over how courses rotations and sites are connected together and metrics.
So looking at your website for LMU, if we look at the hierarchy of these requirements for students, we have a core primary, secondary, and selective in metrics.
Under grade books set up, there is a way to create the requirements for a training program and the way that it works as you come in here, create add grade, greater course rotation.
And this allows you to create something with, if you choose rotation, it allow you to define the number of weeks and within each of these, you can also create subcategories.
So I created core curriculum is 28 weeks expand that primary, secondary selective with 12, eight, and eight weeks. Expand that.
And it gives me the courses that are part of this same thing for electives. And once these are created, you have your sites that are offering different types of training.
And so for example, you have CVM 7, 7 2 here, and then you also have CVM 7 72 here. If I edit one of these, I can hook this up to the course requirements here.
So CVM seven, um, 7, 7 2 here. So this is the course requirement, and this is the actual rotation that is offered at a specific site.
And then if I go to this next one here, I can also choose the same parent course. And now if one student is scheduled to CVM 7 72 at SPCA, and another student is scheduled to the humane society of Austin, they&#39;re both going to count towards the same requirements that we have defined.
So that&#39;s something that we have to do for all of the different rotations that are offered. Each of the sites is going to be hooked back to the course requirements.
So I hope that explains the, uh, uh, the, the connections in the system. And we&#39;re also adding a dashboard that will allow you in the future to see how many of those weeks were completed and how many still remain.
And, uh, uh, as part of their scheduling module,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4940cde844bd4b81ab2f8b4167b5a342</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 31 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys for this feature we&#39;re going to do is for programs on the company portal.

So to bring the cost down a little bit more, since you&#39;re not going to be using the Iris module, and you can see this includes the evaluations, the onboarding tools, the block and shift scheduling under the clinical schedules, uh, module calendar ability to share various resources managing various documents, um, time-off management case logging communication feed.
So this is all part of the RGM package. And the only other thing that we&#39;re, we have a removed as the Iris, but even though you&#39;re not going to be using metrics where Iris we&#39;re going to have schedule exports, that can be used to get the data out of the system and give, be PA passed to finance when they need to do the Irish reporting and the another, another system and our subscription includes everything, um, including support from our plan, our team.
This can be, um, It&#39;s can be, uh, uh, via our instant messaging system that is built into the platform. Um, and this, when someone is in the platform, they can click on the little icon at the bottom, right, start a discussion with us and get a response from our team in Philadelphia, um, email and form a phone number, Uh, scheduled messages, uh, meetings.
So as part of our subscription, we also have, um, scheduled meetings with our support and customer success teams that is included, and it is something that can be done via zoom.
And our, we have a calendar that can be used to schedule these meetings and all of the, um, All of our, um, clients also have, will receive our full implementation, which takes about three months.
And we&#39;ll be working with your team on a bi-weekly basis to implement different parts of the system. And we usually start off with defining the scope with different key results that we want to accomplish.
And each of those key results are going to be covered as part of these meetings that we have with your team, from our team.
There&#39;s usually a committee that&#39;s put together for this implementation. That includes a physician, a, um, uh, analyst and some of them customer success.
And we, um, have initial kickoff and then every two weeks we meet to configure and set up different parts of the system.
So this is a big part of our implementation process that makes, uh, ensure that the organizations are maximizing, um, the, uh, the value they&#39;re getting out of the platform.
And here&#39;s the pricing for 217 residents. Again, this is something that we come down on the price a little bit because of removing the Iris module and it&#39;s annual subscription rate of that.
And then for faculty or staff that is using the platform, um, you can add an unlimited number of users with, uh, without any cost and for implementation and training as a one-time fee of 2,500.
And we also include our customer success support as part of the, uh, subscription to including our customer success manager. Knowledge-based monthly webinars on all product updates during the subscription fair period, as well as virtual meetings.
There&#39;s So we don&#39;t need this. This is, um, UME stuff And this provides some more details on how we maintain our data.
Um, and metros includes unlimited storage for any sort of, uh, documents or other files that you need to store and metrics.
We don&#39;t support video files, but other than that, you can add as many documents as you like.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9933111381f54da1bcab27c705d92c83</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE - Exam Chart - Google Docs - 31 May 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi marina. So for this, uh, task, we&#39;re going to be adding another chart and wanting to create the shorter video, explaining what we talked about yesterday.
So when you click a new chart, we&#39;ll be adding this exam score chart. In addition to the one that we already have.
And once the selected we&#39;ll show this second section here called a bar chart settings for x-axis from there, there&#39;ll be able to select an exam type, which we have a defined in the system under the institutional portal, customize, we have exam types and we&#39;ll be showing the same list there For the second one, we have to give them a way to define the ranges for the bar charts.
So if we look at this example down here, you&#39;ll see that this has a range of zero to 2.993 to 2.3 0.24 and so on.
And this one has a different range that starts at 180 and then increments by, um, nine. So there are a couple of ways that we can approach this, that we talked about yesterday.
One is for them to define the date range of the, uh, score ranges, separated by a comma. Second option that we talked about was setting a minimum value and then an increment value.
So if I set that to be 2.99 and income Renna, 2.25, it&#39;ll create something similar to this. If we do set a minimum value, what we want to do is make sure we capture any scores that are less than the minimum value as a, as a bar, as a first bar, and then we&#39;ll have the rest of them.
So you can see here. They said, if we said the minimum value is 180, then everything that&#39;s less than that will be this bar here, here, this is the, a minimum.
And then a 2.99, then zero to 2.99 is the first bar. So please think about what, which will be the better approach here.
And then we can decide on that after, um, The X axis is, uh, defined the Y axis. We have only one option counts, so we can have that preselected and the label and bar size is going to be bar chart size is going to be the same functionality as before trainee grade status and grade bar marker color is going to be the same.
In addition to this, the exam chart will have a third option, which will be the peer average color. So if we look at this example, here, we have blue as that color for the bar chart, trainees is going to be orange color.
And then the peer average is going to be a darker blue. So you can see there&#39;s three colors that we need to define.
And then at the bottom, save this chart in the following document category is something that will allow the administrators to save the generated chart into the document section of the user profile.
So under users, Documenting certifications, it&#39;ll show up here under the appropriate category that we specify. And then we&#39;ll be able to use this, to insert it into a doc, into a document as a merge field, and everything else is going to work exactly the same degenerate chart functionality is going to work the same.
Uh, the only difference is going to be that once it&#39;s generated is going to be sending this file to the document section instead of the grade book.
And we can also, um, check out this library, the Panda&#39;s library to see is going to help us with, uh, doing the math, um, for these ranges.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/17685c084fa54e1b83fec521d0e5805d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Ability to Duplicate Block Schedule</pre></td><td><pre>So for the block schedules each year, this program coordinators have to create new block structures. I mean, a block schedule, but oftentime the dates and everything.
And the block structure is the same as the previous year. So we can simplify their workflow by allowing them to make a duplicate of current academic year.
Current academic years blocks, schedule them, roll it over to the next year. So the way that I&#39;m thinking we can do this is to, we can add a button for duplicate and no order to make, uh, keep this, this, uh, interface from getting cluttered.
You can actually replace the delete button with an action button so that it brick comes a dropdown like this, and we can have duplicate and delete in there.
So basically, same number of buttons, click on it. It brings up duplicate. And if I click on that, it&#39;ll bring up a little window for duplicate.
And then, um, on this window we can ask, we can ask, uh, the user what they, which academic period, they want to duplicate everything too, and then make the migration.
And when you click duplicate, it&#39;ll copy over everything from the current schedule, except for the assignments. And they would also be adjust a block, start date and end dates to reflect the next academic period or whichever academic period he chose.
So the key thing here is that when we move the silver, the block dates will be different. So notice that if I had to open this up, if I choose the current academic period, everything will remain the same, but if I choose the next academic period, then the start date, maybe July 1st, 2018 onwards.
So we would basically copy everything over and just shift everything to the next academic period and make sure that it&#39;s correct.
We would not be copying over any assignments. If the students are scheduled to the current, this block schedule and we&#39;re copying the structure over, it will not copy any of them, any of the assignments that they have on there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0fc37f34f43c4c7b8a4a893eed07e20b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 11 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So for this particular task, I want to recap what we talked about. We&#39;re going to have to add a category, sorry, a tab called accounts.
And it&#39;s going to be the first tab in this, uh, page. And actually we can keep categories as the first tab.
We&#39;ll add, uh, accounts, tap to the second location here, and it&#39;s going to look very similar and it&#39;s going to say like X number of accounts.
And for this table here, it&#39;s going to show the, the account name, the status, and then an action column that allows them to click a edit button or deactivate button data button would allow them to rename the account types.
And then the deactivate button will update the status from active to inactive, and then they can click it. It becomes an active button and it reactivates it.
We can borrow this functionality of activation deactivation from what you already designed a while ago under the same thing we have here, you can see active and Diaz inactive, and then, um, edit and deactivate button.
So you can basically borrow this, um, for the accounts tab that we&#39;re going to create. And in the categories tab, which we&#39;re looking at here, we need to do the apply the same thing here.
Action column, activate deactivate. And then, uh, we already have the edit button here when you click edit, um, is going to allow them to rename things if they need to.
We should also, um, have cat, so categories belong to accounts. So if you have a category that belong to a particular account, if the account is inactive, it will be good for us to also deactivate.
No, actually, no, we don&#39;t need to do that. Uh, because categories can belong to multiple accounts. So I&#39;m adding a new category, a tab called accounts, creating a way to activate deactivate and edit those accounts.
Uh, editing involves renaming it and that&#39;s it. And then for the categories that we have here, update the status to look like the, uh, um, the newer design and then adding a deactivate, a button here, um, to be accurate if they need to.

I wanted to create a video that shows how the rotations sites and courses are all connected together and metrics.
So I&#39;ve been looking at the, uh, LMUs website for curriculum, and I saw that is broken down into core curriculum, primary instructional sized, secondary sites and electives.
So in metrics, we didn&#39;t really touch on this during this, uh, implementation, um, uh, meetings under grade book set up, there is a way to map out your requirements.
And the way that it has done is you create, um, graded course rotations. And the way that it works is you come in here and you click, uh, um, create a new graded course rotation.
And this would allow you to create the first level of the hierarchy, which is a core curriculum. So that&#39;s 28 weeks and it&#39;s coming from here.
Then within that, we put in, um, um, let me see if I can, this actually should be secondary instruction. I sites.
So we have primary instructional sites, secondary instructional size and selectives, and lets us update the number of weeks eight weeks there.
Alright. So once we have the set up, we can expand it and we can also create the rotations that are required for weeks.
The CVM 7 7 2 7 7 3 and can do the same thing for electives. So once this framework is created under system set up rotations, we have the different, um, courses that are offered at each of the sites.
So CVM seven, seven to seven seven to, um, when we edit this, this particular one is linked to, um, SPCA serving Erie county.
What, we can also link that to the Grade book, uh, course that we, uh, we have created for, for tracking the requirements.

So I&#39;m trying to recreate this issue that we saw earlier, and this is a backup of your Kaiser database.
It&#39;s not the actual system, but in order to recreate it, I&#39;m trying to do it here. So when I go into the system and find one of these, uh, residents, Let me see this user, for example, and go to edit demographics.
This is the issue that we had found where the home institution is missing. And if I go to the profile, It&#39;s also missing here.
However, If I edit this, Just make sure that I change it to the right one here. It&#39;s UC San Francisco fresh, no Click save.
And I go back to this page, Everything works fine. So, um, there&#39;s not really any problem with the way that it&#39;s working when I edited, edited a home institution.
And if I go back to At this page, it&#39;s also working fine here. Um, I even tried creating a test user from scratch Just to see if it was a problem when it&#39;s getting created initially, but that also worked fine.
So what I was hoping that you can do on your end is two things. Cause I wanted to see if this is happening specifically on Kaiser&#39;s network, for some reason.
Um, if you go into this rotators fresh snow and edit, let&#39;s say, need twos profile, go to the edit demographics and fix her UC San Francisco by editing the home institution and then go to the profile and go to the education tab, make sure that it&#39;s showing up there and then you can run an Iris report and see if it shows up there.
So if changing this here, Um, fix us, everything in Iris, then, then, uh, we&#39;re stuck. I got to figure out why, why, how that Jenelle was able to create that record without a home institution field, because I can&#39;t seem to do that.
And the other thing that I&#39;d like you to do is if you have time as to create a new resident, a test resident is called a test resident with a fake email address and try selecting a home institution.
Um, and then once it&#39;s created go to the education tab and see if the, The home institution is showing up there, sorry, I just chose a Rez, a student there.
I go to a resident Education and make sure that it&#39;s showing up here also. Um, so if you can test those two things and let me know what you find and the test resident, you can delete it afterwards by going to the user&#39;s page and simply deleting it.
Um, cause this seems to be a problem that is specific to Jenelle. Um, when he initially saw it, I thought maybe though there was a problem with the two fields getting sinked, but no matter how many times I try it, everything is working on my end.

Like I choose question seven and response is going to show the text that was in the field. And then they can save that once you, when you submit the grade, this is going to get added to the grade book.
And we also need to update that grade or score, um, object to have a link, a foreign key to the original form response so that there is a connection between that grade book entry and into the, uh, to the original evaluation where the comment was pulled from.

We will need to add a bullying field so that we captured this reviewed. Um, and we can call it a review status.
And if it&#39;s reviewed, the check box will be turned on. If it&#39;s not reviewed, they will uncheck it. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re showing here.
In addition to this, we can also do a little cleanup on this model. We want to remove this whole section at the top that says rotation duration had evaluations.
This is no longer applicable for this model and an old piece of code that we never removed so we can get rid of that.
And the other thing that we want to do is once we enable this feature and something is marked as reviewed, we are going to show a, um, let&#39;s do it like this.
So what we&#39;re going to do is if a rotation is not reviewed, if it doesn&#39;t have the checkbox turned on, we&#39;re going to show a red R next to that assignment.
And once they click on it and turn on the checkbox, the red, um, are, will disappear. So at the top, we&#39;re going to show a count of the number of reviews that have been completed and how many that are pending.

Um, and then again, not, uh, like we said, our agile folks aren&#39;t being too strict, so we&#39;re just gonna keep this as a rollover one and I&#39;ll just work with APO to figure out how to, how they want us to do that, do that a new world order.
Um, okay, so we&#39;ll tag, so these two need to be tagged. Um, and then this item, we don&#39;t need any resources to support, um, uh, from our, uh, other teams or banner anybody, cause this is going to be no integration.
Um, and I don&#39;t know if I called it out by well. Um, And you can, uh, and I don&#39;t, I know you&#39;re not really using this yet, but as we start to use this more, um, this is totally your team space or whatever.
I just put stuff in there usually to kind of, you know, from a high level and, but, um, feel free to Use that.
Okay. So in order to gration for this delivery, and then we&#39;re going to follow up in PI three w with a sense of urgency to get the integrations in, um, for both these programs.
Okay. Is this, um, Dave, how do you feel, uh, for this on your team as this, um, feeling like it&#39;s too much just right.
Or not enough work for your team? I feel fine about this. Okay. Yeah, we got Kevin McCloud is, is his focus will be on the UC and Ross, Jake we&#39;ll focus on CU and then we&#39;ll be tagging the other teams and we&#39;ll set up meetings with them during PI planning.
So they understand what their, their, uh, asks are going to be as well. Tosh. And Chris, how are you guys selling with, um, the work for the next couple of months?
Yeah, we&#39;re, we&#39;re good on that, uh, timeline, the, uh, we just need to figure out the exact, exact start date for psych mental health, Psych mental health.
Oh, segments. Okay. Okay. Um, so the exact start date of when you&#39;re going to start. Yeah. When we, when we do need to be available to start that implementation.
Got it. So we need to get the sow and everything is done with that. Um, okay. So I will work on that piece, um, and really quick, this is not including obviously the need to do the planning and discovery for potentially all of CU, which is going to be, um, what we&#39;re working on in PI to, uh, with the hopes of starting either MP3 or PI four, depending on what the, the, um, decision is.
Okay. Anything else again? Um, this is a great conversation. I just want to make sure that we were, uh, at least very clear on, um, PI two.
Um, can we say we&#39;re good to go into PI planning, um, day, or do you want to keep our sessions for PI planning and, um, for next week?
I think I&#39;m okay. I mean, okay. I&#39;m afraid if I need to add one, I&#39;ll reach out to you, but I&#39;m going to go in and, and tag the teams and make sure that it looks all right from my end.
I&#39;m going to change them to ready whenever it&#39;s supposed to be changed to. Yeah, I think I already put them in writing just because I had to have them in ready just to talk about them yesterday.
I wouldn&#39;t have got it, but it was just like, I don&#39;t, whatever. I just need them to show up on this list.
So, Um, So yeah, they would stay in refinement and yes, you would determine ready usually. So, um, uh, neither here nor there.
We do have a standing meeting on Monday with this group. I&#39;ll keep it just so as we digest this, if there are questions that you want to come back to the table with, we have that Monday meeting already there.
If you get into Monday and you&#39;re like, Nope, we&#39;re good for planning. I don&#39;t need anything else from, uh, in the clinical management.
We&#39;ll cancel that. And then we don&#39;t really need to do anything else until planning starts. Okay. So Tosh, I&#39;ll be in touch again.
I know this is very specific to, um, uh, getting us ready for, uh, our planning session. It&#39;ll be of other things that we need to, um, solidify as well.
Um, anybody else have anything burning that we need to make sure we address? Um, just do you have everything you need?
Yes, I think I&#39;m good. Thank you. Okay. I&#39;m Jake. I owe you some feedback and we have to wrap up some stuff.
So I&#39;m so sorry. PI planning got in the way of this week. No worries. Um, Uh, one minor thing, cause uh, we keep these in his term PTI and 2, 3, 4.
So we just get dates like a little table of what Absolutely. Um, I&#39;ll share the calendar Going along, but you know, know that case are, I&#39;m like, okay.
One goes out to the other. Yeah. But they should be quarters. Like, um, We got a little side, um, you know, acquisition and trying to, uh, you know, um, get this, this marriage underway.
Uh, we, we took a little long with RPI one, so RPI two is a bit shorter to kind of get back on track.
So it&#39;s just, it usually is April, may, June. So, um, uh, but you know, you, you have dates and, uh, we&#39;ll send that to you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4b212ceb5998418d99de84cd587c40bb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom Message - 22 March 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Janell. So I was, this is a copy of the Kaiser data and I was testing this shifts issue just to make sure that I CA I, I looked at everything one, um, then they don&#39;t want to point out this may not be the issue and this, this is completely unrelated.
But one thing that I wanted to point out is that, um, if I go into a shift and I click edit and I go in here and I remove this entry, it will allow you to click into the next shift and add people to it And updated.
But it, the initial one is not removed because initially I didn&#39;t, I went after that, made the change here. I didn&#39;t click update shifts.
So you always want to make sure that the update shifts is clicked, uh, when removing someone before clicking on the next, a shift where they need to be added to, um, we&#39;re going to add a re an alert that pops up if someone is removed from a shift.
And then if, if, uh, if the page is clicked without clicking update shift, it&#39;ll pop up and say, Hey, there was a change made to this shift.
Uh, please confirm that it needs it. You want to make those changes. So that&#39;s something that to be aware of.
Um, again, I have no idea if that is the issue that happened, uh, it may not be, um, we&#39;re going to add those alerts and see if those, um, help with that process.
And if it happens again, we&#39;ll have to see if we can recreate it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/169ae6eca22840c6b774a00bb293850c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 13 February 2022</pre></td><td><pre>So this functionality is to help us prevent mistakes when evaluations are or identify mistakes, when evaluations are not assigned properly.
What we want to do is add an alert like this on the dashboard that shows trait number of trainees with no evaluation assignments or less than X number of evaluation assignments during a specific time period.
So Actually what we can do is show number of trainees, um, with completed rotations that have no assignments done on them, where they&#39;re in an evaluate evaluator or where they&#39;re, uh, there are no evaluations for them when they&#39;re in evaluate toward the complete on others.
So basically an alert that says, um, ex uh, people with missing evaluations, and then it&#39;s going to X training. Let&#39;s do X trainees with missing evaluations.
And when it comes up, we can bring up a modal. And in the model, we&#39;ll have maybe two tabs, one where it says, evaluate tour.
I want another one that says, uh, evaluate T and then, um, it should let them see a list of all the trainees that have no assignments.
I have no assignments for specific, uh, rotations that were completed. So on the block schedule, they have rotations that have, uh, where the end dates have passed already.
And there, they have not been assigned any evaluations where they&#39;re in evaluate tour or any evaluate T uh, and this way an administrator can look at it and then they can see the name, click, maybe expand, and it&#39;ll show a list of all the rotations that are missing evaluations and look to see if this happened because an assignment rule was not set up correctly.
Something a schedule was not an, uh, publish, whatever it may be. So two tabs, one for when they&#39;re supposed to be an evaluator, another one where they&#39;re supposed to be evaluated T social, a list of the names, and then they have a way to expand it so that he can see the list of the block, uh, rotation assignments with no evaluations linked to it.
And then they can, uh, go on troubleshooting.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0cd74ab8ba2647c09e279e5ec0529f28</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Demos Questions.docx - Google Docs - 19 April 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, this is a document that we&#39;re working on for UT Southwestern. It&#39;d be great if you can spend a little bit of time on some of these questions, because I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to be able to finish all of it.
Um, so for example, kind of going through it, looking at what Chris wrote and, uh, this video, and it&#39;s, for example, if we look at this one, I already wrote the response.
Um, you can see if there&#39;s anything else we can highlight about our announcements module and then maybe drop a screenshot of what that looks like.
And for this one, overall calendar admins can do this by overlay a particular users. So this one, Chris is describing the program admin portal.
And if you go to the calendar, you can select a specific user and see, um, an individual schedule. So we&#39;re kind of, we can take a screenshot of the, um, calendar page, draw an arrow to that individual section there, and then explain that all administrators have access to a unified calendar and where they can turn on schedules for different courses or clinical schedules.
And then in addition to that, there&#39;s an, a way to select an individual on that page and see what that individual&#39;s schedule looks like.
Um, I should probably start at the top So we could, for this question, we could explain that on the administrative side, we are able to create different types of schedules and calendar and events.
And each of the faculty members and students have their own dedicated, um, portals where they see relevant material and personalized schedules for their, uh, use case.
And we also emphasize that these, um, schedules can also be, um, merged from multiple different, uh, admin, um, events. So if they have core schedule, uh, schedules versus a regular event versus a clinical schedule, they all flow into one unified calendar for each person.
This one allow individuals to post personal appointments. So I&#39;ll take care of that one allow calendar view from, yes. So you can kind of describe this and say, metrics includes the ability to access the platform from anywhere it&#39;s a SAS platform and it is a available for on phones and tablets with the system adapting to, to the screen size.
And then also emphasizing that our can be sinked with all external calendars, such as Google, apple, and I Cal sorry, Google, apple, and outlook.
So I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re asking here. Yes, it does support outlook. We can say that there are men. We did not have, we, we do have a mandatory and required.
Um, actually I can take care of this one. Yes. This is something that you can explain, um, that we have the ability to attach files to co uh, sessions, and it can also provide a link to an external repository and the student view that you created, you can pull some screenshots of it and explain that course materials can be viewed on there.
I&#39;ll take care of that one. We can say, Yeah, I&#39;ll take care of that one. I&#39;ll take care of that.
I&#39;ll take care of that. Yes. And we can explain that our changes are pushed to the, uh, I mean, uh, uh, people can subscribe to our calendars and those calendars can pull the changes in, well, we can&#39;t push to external calendars cause that set a setting on the other calendar, but they can configure that to be pulled in it as many times as we want.
They want, we want to limit them. Yes. Uh, explaining that yes, we do send out reminders of and um, update them about changes.
And we can also include a screenshot of that email notification. Do you creator for calendar events Change? Yes, we do do that.
I&#39;ll take care of that. Yeah. That&#39;s pretty much it. Um, I&#39;m going to work on the rest of them, but if you can add, um, help with some of these questions, that&#39;ll be awesome.
Thank you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2edc997021cf4d60ab04f0fdb37c2038</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software - 6 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So I&#39;m going to have to meet tomorrow to go over the, uh, OKR. So we already have a meeting for tomorrow that we&#39;ll can do that at 2:00 PM.
Hopefully that&#39;s still okay with you. If you need to change that, we can do that. Um, I want to send over a couple of things to think about before the meeting.
So the first thing is, uh, first thing I want to talk about is, you know, which what you want to do down the road, because it&#39;s been difficult for me to figure out where your interests lie and what the plans are for the future.
And it&#39;s better for us to talk about it and figure that out. Um, whatever you decide is fine, you know, I&#39;ll work with that.
So the first thing is if the plan is to, um, you know, if you&#39;re not happy at metrics and you want to find something else, then we can plan for that.
Um, but if you do, uh, if you&#39;re, if you are interested in getting more into the finance of business side of metrics, um, the part that I want to work on this quarter is figuring out a more structured, um, timeline for working together and collaborating more closely on different, uh, areas of the business, such as, um, learning about the sales process, how to communicate in a, in a, uh, uh, different, uh, um, communicate and negotiate from a sales perspective.
So that as a CFO of the company, you&#39;re able to make decisions that are necessary for the team and be able to, uh, support different, um, processes that are related to sales and getting new clients up and running.
And then also from a second part of it is just selling your ideas to the team and getting, um, your ideas to the team or even to investors in a effective manner.
Uh, because a lot of times this last year, it&#39;s been difficult to, um, um, you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s partly something that is difficult to do remotely, but even like, for example, most recently, you know, the health dashboard, I feel like you put a lot of time into it and it&#39;s, it hasn&#39;t been used as much.
And I feel like this has a lot of potential in it. And unfortunately I haven&#39;t had the time to push, um, the team to make use of it and do things with it.
And I&#39;d rather meet with you and talk through what are some of the ways that you can push and meet with the team and drive that process, um, to sell your ideas to them and get them up and running.
And, or even from the investor update perspective, what are the ways that you can get the team to, um, proactively communicate with you?
And it needs to also start some processes to the financial that if people are not submitting like a, you know, randoms, slack messages about certain things, which have a more structured way to communicate, um, or some of things related to finance.
So anyway, so there&#39;s two types of discussions that I want to put into the . One is more, uh, general business slash, um, sales discussions about how the company operates.
So you have a more intuitive understanding of everything and able to do more than bookkeeping, um, and you know, filling out forms.
So in the past, you know, the, the work that you&#39;ve done is super helpful and it&#39;s been helping us move forward with the finance and organizing the netbooks books.
Um, but going forward, you know, it needs, you know, the bookkeeping part of it, it&#39;s, it&#39;s something that can be outsourced if we need to.
What I would need you to do is sort of focus on the strategy, building the strategy and the relationship building aspect of the CFO role, because that&#39;s the role, that&#39;s the area that we need to scale.
Um, and then otherwise it&#39;s difficult to play that role and, and purely be, uh, you know, just maintaining the books and paperwork.
And then from a development perspective, if this, if your interest is getting into this and doing more of this, we need to offload the development side.
And it is, you know, I&#39;ve mentioned this a few times in the past and trying to figure out strategies for that.
You know, since you started, we have hired, uh, so many, uh, five or six developers and we need it&#39;s, uh, something that we have to figure out a process and have that offloaded so that your default work is not development work.
Your default work is the, the business side of things and develop into something that you&#39;re helping with if needed. Um, and then down the road, it&#39;s, it will cause I, I don&#39;t see a way to build out the CFO role or the skills for that without cutting back on this.
And, but if you want to focus on this, that&#39;s fine also, and then handle the bookkeeping. And then, uh, but I, for me, it&#39;s important to know what the plan is so that I can figure out accordingly for the future.
Um, so the, the, um, these are the things that I want you to think about, and then we can talk through the details and maybe turn this into one or two.
Okay. Ours. And in addition to anything that you&#39;re planning.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d14fc01393e845ecbd96b29938a568b0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 17 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>One more thing to cover, um, about users is we want to emphasize and just cover these fields. There&#39;s email address and there&#39;s, um, student employee, and, um, trainee ID.
These are unique identifiers that we use to link data to the system. So if a user is being imported to the metrics, we&#39;ll check the student ID to make sure that, um, it&#39;s, it doesn&#39;t exist.
And then you create that user account. There&#39;s also the metrics activation date users will not be allowed to log into metrics before this date.
And there&#39;s also a variety of other personal details that can be added, but we don&#39;t need to go into all of that on the users page.
There&#39;s two things that we want to cover first of the invite tab, and then explain to them that users can only be, uh, only logged into the system.
If they&#39;ve been invited, there are three different statuses that we show here. There&#39;s the invited and not invited, and then last logged in.
So if this is the last log, then it means they have a least, they have, they have access to metrics.
If it&#39;s invited, that means they have been invited, but they have never logged in. And then on the people tab, there&#39;s one thing to cover is the filters at the top allows us to toggle between active and inactive users.
And you can also filter by roles search here. And when you want to deactivate a user, you can click the deactivate user allows you to select what you want to do with their data.
Uh, we never delete anything. It&#39;s just basically canceled things out. If we need to cancel it out and you can only delete an account if no data has been linked to it.
So if Anthony&#39;s account was just made and there&#39;s no data link to it, you can delete it. Otherwise you&#39;re going to lead deactivate a user.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3f7a0cd9859941fe96aa7f3d94a26675</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So for this feature under curriculum set up and, um, director permissions, we&#39;re going to add a couple more check boxes that are turned on by default.
The first one will be saying, allow of course directors, we can, you can probably clean this up a little. So having a course director section and a session leader section, so that it&#39;s easier to manage.
And then, um, maybe with this, uh, select all option anyway, so course director giving them the permission to view evaluations for the course, uh, for the view evaluations, um, Don on the student, uh, on the, on the users, uh, scheduled in the course.
So allow course directors to view evaluations done on, um, people&#39;s schedules to the course. And the second permission allows course directors to view case log submitted, um, by users scheduled to the course or people&#39;s scheduled to the course.
So giving them a bit of abuse evaluations, but not all evaluations will the evaluations that are done on the student.
Um, you don&#39;t want to see the, you don&#39;t want to give them the access to the evaluations that are done by the student on the course itself.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/45aec6b438a34286ad01baff6819d656</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loan payback - Budget - Google Sheets - 9 January 2022</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, David. So I didn&#39;t get a chance to look at it earlier in the weekend, so I I&#39;m getting to it now.
Um, I started a, a stream on fellow under other streams. You&#39;ll see operations and finance figured we have a centralized place for tracking, um, operations and finance.
I already added you to this. This is for any discussions or meetings we have related to the company. And then the one-on-ones can be anything that is related to the use specifically like OKR and stuff like that.
So there&#39;s a few things I wanted to, uh, include in this video. You can review with a video and then I&#39;m going to add a call for later, eh, probably tomorrow on Tuesday, um, where we can go through anything from this meeting, this video, as well as plan out any, uh, details for the novel presentation.
So the first thing about the reimbursement, sorry, uh, debt repayment. So I&#39;ve reviewed this, uh, um, items in here. I&#39;m assuming that Ben Franklin, Matt, Terry, and Don, uh, good for my loan.
I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s coming. All of this coming from QuickBooks. One item to point out is for my loans. This was a document that I had created, um, some time ago and in this, when I made it and, uh, shared some notes and try to match up all the payments, there were a couple of things in here, like misclassified and QuickBooks.
Um, I&#39;m not a hundred percent sure if, um, this was ever corrected or reclassified. So like here, it says $900 Chris&#39;s account touches money.
Um, this is because Chris, um, some reason I couldn&#39;t make a deposit from my account and we needed to make a payment for rent or something.
Um, but anyway, so if this is, if there&#39;s any questions about it, um, I can help clarify it or anything after June, 2019, it should be very clear in QuickBooks and it&#39;s all going to be classified to me when the earlier ones, the ones that may have issues.
And then for the first salary, there are some items missing here unless, uh, I forgot something and I was paid for it.
Um, wanna, maybe your class, you, you, uh, adjusted, uh, based on what I was paid. Um, so I wanted to confirm that from here.
So after my shares vested for four years, that&#39;s when I started adding my salary, uh, here July onwards. So this is the schedule for that.
And I see that this from here, it&#39;s starting from January of 2019 onwards. Um, so it, it may be that you had, uh, accounted for something here.
Um, but anyway, I wanted to make sure that I didn&#39;t get a chance to double check it, but I&#39;ll do that later.
But I wanted to confirm that this was factoring from 2017 onwards and for 2021 from October 1st onwards, for me, Rio and Chris, we had a new contracts that were drafted for us to be, uh, have a salary adjustments to account for, um, the, um, after our shares had bested, we had never had a salary adjustment to count for the market rate.
So we had that changed and it had a new contract made. So I wanted to make sure that that was being captured here.
Um, same thing for Chris and Rio. Um, you may be capturing it somewhere else. I want to make sure that&#39;s addressed.
And then for this expenses, assuming that is coming from here. So those are, those are the two things that I wanted to mention with deferred salary, um, from 2017 onwards, the newer changes that were accounted for whether that&#39;s going to be captured here or not.
Um, and then for under the other external debt depths are, I&#39;m not sure if that company still exists. Uh, I would have to look into it.
I believe the founders all left and they started another company. Um, either way we can keep it on the books and then a follow up if we need to.
All right. So that&#39;s the first thing, the second thing. So I did look into the things that I need to sign in Carta and had a Question here So, um, my question was, is this thing that I need to sign for the second year?
Um, or is that different or was it for third year? Cause uh, when I had looked at the agreement, um, and then from what I recall also, we had, uh, started in, on a 1, 1 20 19, uh, with a four year vesting period.
And it was the, at the end of one year, there was a $60,000, um, bonus for a meeting, uh, meeting a certain goals.
And I believe that was maybe captured at west part of this. And then it was for 24 months, um, for overseeing being the, basically the, the lead developer and, uh, taken on the extra role of finance for the first 24 months.
There was the thousand shares, well, uh, playing the role of CTO for the first 24 months, the thousand dollar, a thousand shares per month.
So, uh, what I wanted to clarify was if this was for, if this is something that was forgotten to add for a second year, or is this is for the third year, because, uh, the way that it&#39;s, it was only meant to be for 24 months, because that was the time period where, um, it was the only developers on the team where you marina and, uh, Rio.
And there was a lot of, uh, extra development hours that needed to be, but, and then after that we had a hired, um, multiple additional developers.
And then the assumption is that after 24, during that 24 month period, we addressed the, um, responsibility so that there&#39;s multiple developers that were added.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/927b232589414c58acf70ecab61d14ce</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Renewal call</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ken. Um, so I finished what I needed to do for RFP. So I figured I&#39;d record a little video on what I was going to, uh, present to or talk to Tammy about.
So, uh, first thing is sort of, um, uh, introducing that this is renewal time and we are reaching out to, uh, speak to her before we send out the paperwork, wanted to let her know that this is something that, uh, uh, over the past year we&#39;ve been working very hard with the team here to continue to grow metrics.
And we hope that she&#39;s been seeing, um, um, that from our end, ask her for any big picture feedback, um, that she has.
And then the areas that I want to address, uh, before the renewal is in the past, we had discussions about, um, adding several new programs and we have provided quotes for it.
Um, but after Dr. Sergeant, uh, left, the understanding was that programs was getting pushed back. Um, was there any updates on these programs and is there anything else that we took count for when we send the renewal information?
And then the other piece of it is, um, um, is there other, you know, are there any adjustments in the number of trainees that are going to be part of the system in the upcoming year and, uh, the total number of residents that they need that they will have?
And the third thing is if there&#39;s any medical students that are coming there for rotation, would they be interested in considering metrics for those medical students?
Um, and, and as far as the, uh, the pricing, the, it is going to the same pricing as last year.
There was some minor adjustments that we do annually to adjust for inflation, but aside from, if there&#39;s no changes in the numbers, it would be the, uh, uh, the same pricing and we&#39;ll send the paperwork over, um, uh, as soon as possible, uh, unless there&#39;s any changes to be made for the number of programs or any new trainees, uh, that need to be added to the system.
And then lastly, before ending, the call would ask if there&#39;s any other problems that they&#39;re, uh, uh, facing, uh, not just in metrics from an organizational workflow that they would want to consider metrics for.
And if there&#39;s anything that we can offer, um, because we&#39;ve been working with different institutions to add new functionality, there may be use cases that they haven&#39;t really, um, um, and that we haven&#39;t really encountered.
So if there&#39;s any broad things that she&#39;s working on, um, we can make note of that. And it&#39;s also a good time for you to put her on this quarterly, uh, schedule.
And, um, just tell her that after this call, we&#39;ll send her a calendar invite for a recurring reading for every three months.
And, Uh, if she can, we&#39;ll put on the calendar and if she has to change it, we can adjust it as needed.
So that&#39;s a good, a good approach. And if she, if he doesn&#39;t pick up, um, for sales calls, if they don&#39;t pick up, I use a, send an email immediately saying, uh, Hey, Tammy, I try to reach you.
And, uh, w Rishi voicemail wanted to check in with you to, uh, have a goal or a few items before we, um, send over a renewal paper for core metrics and ask if she can, uh, talk tomorrow, uh, tomorrow, the day after.
So it was very effective right after I call, if I send the email immediately, that way she sees the missed call, then she sees the email and either she&#39;ll call back or, or, um, email back.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a7aff336876e4c33a03e69f03a980109</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Next Block Button – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So I think this should work. So I was playing around with this design a little bit and trying to incorporate some other ideas and things that we need to address also for the nursing and the medical schools.
Um, so I, what I did first was I just adjusted the scale of this image so that we&#39;re incorporated where we&#39;re on the same scale as a text.
So the size 12 text looks, um, appropriate on the screen. So then you can set the Hierarchy of the other elements.
So here, Um, I added a second at the top and this, you can redesign this from scratch. I&#39;m just marking up ideas.
Now, um, we have a section at the top that where we&#39;re showing the trainees information. If they want to contact that person, we can include their phone number, email, and pager.
And then we also need to ref when we write the specs, we need to tell the developers, which field to pull this information from.
And you can get that by looking at the user demographics, where am I going to the users page and clicking, edit demographics on one of the abusers and seeing which field has this information.
And here, what I&#39;m I&#39;m borrowing from is the assignment rules page on the evaluation templates, where we can have these accordions and you can click on it to open it and collapse it.
So what I&#39;m thinking is on the grid of the block schedule, when you click on a particular block to edit, it will bring up this model and it will have that appropriate block opened up.
So if I click on block three, you&#39;ll have block three, opened up for the others will be collapsed. And then inside of that, we will include a way to add one or more rotations for that.
And then, um, when they&#39;re first opening it up, it&#39;ll just say block duration. And then, um, nothing is scheduled or like 28 days unscheduled.
Let&#39;s see, We want to call it 20 days on unscheduled. And then if they fill up all the dates, so this image is actually incorrect.
It shouldn&#39;t show a checkbox here. You should just be blank. And then after they fill up all the dates, it&#39;ll show a check box next to it, to indicate that everything is scheduled.
We don&#39;t want to show an ax here to indicate that everything hasn&#39;t been scheduled, because that may not be a, um, an error because some of our programs only log only enter assignments for one or two blocks for the year, depending on if they&#39;re, if they&#39;re a visiting trainee.
So we will only show a checkbox if the entire block is filled with assignments and show just the block name otherwise.
And then, um, on the right side, we&#39;re showing the number of days that are unscheduled and also number of days that are filled.
Um, and on the bottom left, um, I&#39;m thinking we should have a way to show, um, statuses because we save all this information as they&#39;re editing it.
So we don&#39;t have, they don&#39;t need a submit or save button, but we, as they&#39;re being saved or deleted, we should have those inline success or RMS does it show up here so that they know that it&#39;s saved already and here, uh, for each of these items, I wrote down some, uh, tool tips that we can include.
Rio had a little tool tip icon that we can borrow from and just put the icon next to it. When they hover over it, it&#39;ll show these tool tips so that they know what they&#39;re talking, what these items mean.
And, uh, so yeah, this is just what I can come up with right now. If you, uh, you can actually take this redesigned from scratch and, and, uh, so that it&#39;s properly designed and incorporate any other ideas that you may have.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a7dbc045114942d4a65c93246d97589f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled document - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Ken. So we, we didn&#39;t need to discuss anything before you sent it. Uh, w I mainly wanted to give some feedback on why I&#39;ve changed a few of these so that we can sort of build a consistent style for the follow-up.
Um, so, so the first thing is these little videos have been very helpful for them. So whenever we need them to do something, it&#39;s good to include like a loom video, kind of showing them where to find it and how to do it.
Um, and then this is great. I didn&#39;t include the, what we discussed in my last with, so it&#39;s good that you added that.
And then for here, one thing that I would also want to add here in the future is like, when we expect to have that done.
So for having action items, uh, when we&#39;ll have that done, and then for the, anything that they need to complete, making sure that they know how to do it.
So in this video at the top, I covered how to fill out the rotations and where to find, um, that, that those spreadsheets.
And I also have the link here and then for the CU follow up items, um, let me just pull up the original.
So the tweaks that I made here was, um, does it, cause it said designate all institutional administrators, so it&#39;s better to be literal and in terms of what we want them to do, like when you said re-designate institutional administrators, um, they won&#39;t really know what to do with that info, that specific phrase.
So it&#39;s better for us to say email us a list of all the users who should be administrators. And then I also put in there for managing sites because that&#39;s the reason that we want them to be administrators and then update the users, um, upload with program name with, uh, either primary care or acute care and reapply them to resources.
So this is very specific on what they need to do. Um, but if, if we just say, add information to users, upload at primary affiliation column for each, each, uh, user, they may or may not be paying attention in terms of that.
They may remember what a part primary affiliation is, but here I&#39;m just telling them saying, add the primary care or acute care for the users.
And then re-upload them to resources. So include preceptors and the upload spreadsheet. Um, again, I&#39;m trying to assume that they may not have remembered everything or, and they may not have wrote down everything.
So I put it in here, add the PR preceptors to the user approach spreadsheet or the pre-cert tourist tab in the rotation spreadsheet, which is what I covered in the video and specify.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/dac90360eb2f44c9917637accb508605</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Mike. So for this curriculum functionality that I was talking about, what we need to do is write up a feature or we can first design it.
Where right now, if it&#39;s a school of medicine, we see the curriculum. But if it&#39;s set up as a internal medicine or a residency program, we don&#39;t see curriculum at all.
So what we need to do is set it up in a way that if it&#39;s a residency program, we have less of this less content being shown.
So for example, we can remove the curriculum map, um, global objectives, program objectives, um, and then simply keep the courses in rotations and sessions page remove the, um, the search page also.
So once we have just the course in rotation, um, we only need to have this course on rotations and sessions page, and then we can remove everything else.
And then when we, inside of the courses of the rotations tab, we will, um, we&#39;ll actually rename it to, um, just call it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7f697401941d4cfcb3dfb620a2784727</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Ability to run IRIS tests from program admin portals</pre></td><td><pre>So for this feature ability to run Iris test from the program admin portal, what are we going to do is we&#39;re going to make the tests that we have in Iris under data review, under test Iris data.
We&#39;re going to have these tests available for the program administrators to run. So we&#39;re going to do is add a left menu item called Iris.
And on that page, we&#39;ll have, um, some custom design, I mean, uh, uh, update here. That explains what those pages for, and this left menu item will only show up if Iris is enabled.
And I put in there how to tell if it was enabled for that institution and then we&#39;ll list all the tests, just like we have in the previous institutional portal.
The only difference is going to be, there&#39;s going to be a handful of tests that we&#39;re not enabling. And it&#39;ll just have a bootstrap alert that says, this is only for finance admins, but we still want to show it mainly because I want to maintain the numbering scheme of these tests.
So we don&#39;t want to hide it. And then the other thing is on the right side, where it says last run, we only, we would only want to show the dates of when it was run from that particular program.
So of internal medicine runs, it will show the dates for that. And when running the day, uh, this report from the institution institutional portal, we are checking for all the trainees that need to be checked when you&#39;re running your fund, the program portal.
For example, if I&#39;m running for internal medicine, you&#39;ll see here that we have an alert that says metrics are the only check that data for trainees in the primary program of internal medicine.
If I was running, if I was looking at this page from surgery, it&#39;ll say primary program is surgery. So we need to add an extra layer of filtering.
So that only users with the program primary program equals internal medicine or whichever respective program it is are, are being tested.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/eeee18b3d27e4ec993eb745a440bf8d5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 20 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So, this is a brief summary of things that we talked about for MSU and what are the things that we want to cover during this meeting?

And then on the app, we&#39;re giving it the name of the site as a scheduled name. And they&#39;re going to select the appropriate site name here.
We&#39;ll just make this system here, Schedule. And then down here, we&#39;re going to select the administrator. That&#39;s going to be able to edit this schedule from his or her personal portal at the bottom here.
We&#39;re going to specify.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2e03f0bccddf408da6e899ca293c9362</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Good morning. I wanted to clarify something from yesterday&#39;s call. When we create a user and metrics on the users page, they will only have access to the personal portal.
Every user in metrics, whether it be faculty, staff, resident, or a student will have a dedicated personal portal that allows them to complete certain tasks and view their academic data.
In addition to that, we can give them admin privileges. So anybody that requires admin privileges, once we get them the permission, they will see an extra button at the top to switch to the admin portal.
So all of these users that were added, uh, we&#39;ll be giving them admin privileges, but we wanted to make sure that if they contact you saying they don&#39;t see the admin portal it&#39;s because, um, they&#39;re right now set up as a regular user.
And when we update the admin permissions, they&#39;ll have this second tab that they can switch into. So it&#39;s a personal portal and the admin portal.
And in addition to that select individuals who will have access to the institution portal, where the sites can be added.
I also wanted to use this opportunity to specify the, um, rotations that we need, uh, uploaded. So on the same document as sites, there&#39;s a tab for preceptors and, um, you can use this to specify all the rotations and the site they belong to for preceptors.
Um, you can put the email address for the preceptor that we&#39;ll be covering that particular rotation. And then the preceptors can go on the preceptors import or the users.
This is a safe, this is a copy of the user&#39;s import. And the key things here are the unique ID, um, and the email address.
And when we look at the rotations, you&#39;ll see that the email address is used to link the person, um, to the rotation.
And there&#39;s also core practicum forces. The co code that you can add here, this will allow us to figure out where to map this, uh, rotation to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9760141325a647e3b450b3a13d77cd2e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Retreat 21: Building an Infinite Culture - Google Docs - 15 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Ken, I wanted to create this quick video to give you a little bit more context on this document and some of the goals for this discussion, because I feel like with your experience working in hospitals, you can add a more unique perspective on culture and organization and how people operate.
Um, the, it is, um, in addition to talking about some of the, we have, in my opinion, we have a really positive culture already as a small team.
And the purpose of this is not to say we, we have to change a lot of things. It&#39;s more of what are the things that we actually do that that is good.
And how do we turn that into something that can scale? And while we do this, it&#39;s also important to look at, um, the things that we should avoid and, uh, having experienced in hospitals, um, you know, there&#39;s a certain level of culture that happens with healthcare and the cover, your ass approach, the modern healthcare has that is leading to a lot of burnout, and there&#39;s a lot of lessons to be taken from there that we can apply as things that we should avoid.
Um, so it&#39;d be good for you to sort of, um, during this discussion share any experiences that you had, um, that, you know, made a work difficult, um, or it had other, you&#39;ve seen other people have hospital jobs that, that they were unhappy with.
And then, you know, that would help us have a more meaningful discussion on how we should set up by identifying what are the things that are important for us to, um, put into policies in the future.
And again, this is not meant to be an entirely a philosophical discussion. I also want us to focus on real practical things.
So one of the things that we do want to approach in the near future is having some sort of minimum time off policy so that everybody is taking time off.
I want to make sure that people, um, we do have a way to add some benefits over time. Um, so those are practical things also for us to consider, but at the same time, we also want to make sure that we talk about anybody that has experience in different organizations.
We incorporate that feedback. So I&#39;m hoping you Maria and Ken, sorry, Maria and Mike can have, uh, some things to share about that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2df7c26827f243d08ae42b7a65938cf4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Issue · Medtrics Lab / Medtrics · GitLab</pre></td><td><pre>So this particular task or we&#39;re going to do is update the CCC report a little bit. So the CCC report is on the performance page, under CCC or internal medicine here.
And what we&#39;re going to do is add a couple more items to this filter. You&#39;ll see here, we&#39;re going to add sub competency averages below competency averages, and then we&#39;re also going to add work hours.
So let&#39;s take a look at other changes. So if I check, if I select just a competency averages and do not select sub competency averages, I&#39;ll just see these bold entries.
So they should all be moved up. And I&#39;m just going to see the averages for the core competencies name. And if I choose to sub competency, average just turned on, then it&#39;ll show these sub competency averages.
Next. We&#39;ll also rename the peer to the role that we&#39;re averaging by. So this is a PGY one resident, and we&#39;re going to add average by PGY one.
We&#39;ll sew PGY one here. So that&#39;ll be easier for the, uh, administrator to understand that we&#39;re averaging by PGY one.
When we add the work hours, it&#39;s going to show the compliance percentages. Again, this is going to be for the selected date range, uh, priests compliant percentages, total miss days.
Um, this is going to be then the days with, uh, no entries and no days off entries and violations, any total count of the violations.
If there&#39;s none, we&#39;ll just show none. And for the compliance percentages and miss days, um, you can check out how we&#39;re doing these, um, uh, start on here right now, but there is a alert we have for compliance percentages and shows, uh, all the days.
So if we can do the same thing, we can use, probably use the same, um, uh, query to get that information.
And then last thing is we&#39;re going to enter for the exam score section. We&#39;re going to add a column VU, PGY average.
So that&#39;s going to show the role of this resident and the average for all the PGY one or so if it&#39;s a PGY one resident that we&#39;re looking at, the report is going to average for all the PGY ones.
If it&#39;s for a PGY two, it&#39;s going to average for a PGY two. So we&#39;re just going to indicate that the role and then the average and we&#39;ll show the average for each exam.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2444cc5f67f24a1a9db4729f1deda50f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike, so this is something that it&#39;s fairly easy for us to build and it&#39;ll help us with onboarding. Um, so what I want to try to use the metrics, resources, folders for us to onboard clients.
So when a new client is starting with us, we can go in there and create folders for onboarding so they can submit their, uh, documents to us instead of having to go use that Google doc or something.
So in order to do that, we have to have email notifications. So what I wanted to do is inside of each of these, a folder for each folder, um, we want to have a icon for notification settings.
So some icon underneath click on it, you&#39;re able to specify one or more individuals that should be notified whenever a new file is added to that particular folder.
So, and then we need to design an email, what it looks like. It will list out all the files that were added there, who added it, and the tack time and day that it was added.
So setting for each folder for notification who will get notified. And then, uh, the actual email template that shows the list of the new things were added, um, the date that was added and who added it.
Um, and we can also have some sort of alert, not alert, some sort of tag, um, in the details section to indicate that it is, it has an alert set up.
Um, so maybe something that&#39;s there that says, um, alerts or, or notifications. Um, so this just so that if you&#39;re looking at a bunch of folders, you&#39;ll see which ones have notifications turned off.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9d0c6201e74c49caa7af5c7ad445551c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Retreat 21: Building an Infinite Culture - Google Docs - 15 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>They can. So I wanted to create this video to give you a little bit more context on this discussion. And I feel like, um, with your background working at different hospitals, it&#39;s, um, you may be able to add more to the conversation then anybody that hasn&#39;t had that experience.
So I wanted to explain what the goal is. So we, as a company have pretty good culture in my, in my opinion, we, you know, look out for each other and, and do things that are beneficial for the team.
And a lot of great things that we can emphasize that in the beginning. But I also want to use this discussion to talk about some of the things that we would want to make sure we avoid in the future from especially things that are happening in the healthcare or hospital culture, where it&#39;s a cover your ass.
And, um, people looking out to make sure that they&#39;re not getting sued or protecting themselves instead of their colleagues. These are the things that are causing burnout in health systems, among healthcare workers.
And we want to make sure that from a company perspective, we are putting people and processes slash policies in place to make sure over time the culture evolves into something that is basically a very different than some of the, uh, hospital culture that is leading to burnout.
So it&#39;d be good for you to, um, think about that. And this includes, um, not just, uh, the attitudes of the people, but also practical things, um, such as the minimum, um, time off that we want everybody to take and, uh, putting together, uh, benefits over time and putting it together, some sort of, uh, um, um, feedback mechanism or, uh, for, um, for, for how we, uh, um, how we can address any problems that may arise as the team grows and even, um, more practical things like, uh, how do we, what are the things that each individual needs from compensation and, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/616a2d3bd4d7427c9b9b1cf0f03ee04b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike. So another one, this is purely for email notifications. So we have our projects module, which allows us to create different projects and then assign different tasks to people.
One of the reasons that this thing was never used much was because we don&#39;t have email notifications for it. So all we want to do is, um, use some of those email notifications that you have designed in the past and sort of use that as a model and create a few different notifications, that updates users on different statuses of a project.
So for example, when I create a project and if I add certain individuals to a project and you can, we can email them, letting them know that they were added to a project with the details of the project, including name and date and so on with the link to go view the project.
Another thing is when you&#39;re assigned to a particular task, we can notify users saying, Hey, you were added to, uh, assigned to specific tasks on this project.
Um, along with, um, along with any, uh, every time there&#39;s a change in the deadline, um, we can have a notification that goes out H status was changed on a task, and it, if it&#39;s deadline assigned, uh, the person that was assigned or any updates that was posted to a project, we can send them an email notification.
Um, so there&#39;s when you&#39;re added to a project when you&#39;re added to a task, when there&#39;s a change in the deadline status, whether it&#39;s chain marking it as complete or the deadline, and when there&#39;s an update posted, those are the times that we want to send an email notification.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0d899d9764754562b487fd72d96dabbb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Emily, in this video, we&#39;ll take a quick look at how sights and rotations work together. So under, um, the system, we have all of the sites that the institution is affiliated with.
Typically we start off with adding the school of medicine as a site, as an internal site, that all the students are set up as their home institution.
And then for all external hospitals at the hospital that the school is affiliated with, there&#39;ll be added at external sites in order to set up a site, we simply need their name and an ID number.
So if they don&#39;t have an ID, you can just create that. And it&#39;s just has to be unique for each site as for the contact information address and things like that.
It&#39;s not really necessary at this point, if you have it readily, readily available, it can be imported. Um, but we just need a site and an ID number.
Then once we have the site set up, the rotations are linked to each site. So every family medicine or internal medicine that happens at each of these different sites will have a separate record and metrics.
And so for example, this family medicine is linked to metroplex hospital Southeast. This one is linked to the metrics hospital south, and that import file will have a separate record for each of those four.
Once we get to the next step after sites and rotation, we&#39;ll also be adding different administrators and supervisors that are part of that rotation.
Um, and they&#39;ll be having, they&#39;ll have accounts and metrics and we&#39;ll be using this information to match up evaluations. So that&#39;s how sites and rotations are, are, um, connected together.
And if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s, that&#39;s, uh, not available or does, uh, does not need to be shared at this time, it can limit that.
And then we can get started with just the, the, just adding a site name, site ID, rotation, name, rotation ID, and then, um, add the rest later.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ef1b8da303b246328375cdfcc2781077</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Loom Recording 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>And this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how sites and rotations work together. So for every medical school that starts with metrics, we will start off by creating a, um, site for the medical school itself.
That will be the service, a home institution for all the students. But as a, as a students are sent to different hospitals for clinical training, we&#39;ll also capture every external site in, in the system so that we can link the rotations to it.
So for creating a site, there are some basic information that can be added. Um, but the main thing that we need is it&#39;s the name of the site and a, uh, an ID for it.
If the site doesn&#39;t have an ID can just be made up. Um, so that it&#39;s a unique identifier for that site and that&#39;s where the contact information and, uh, uh, any other details, it will be good to add, but it&#39;s not necessary for us to get started.
And then once a, um, site is added, we&#39;re able to create rotations and link it to those sites. So for example, on the rotations page, under system setup of a program, we have every rotation that&#39;s offered and you can see that family medicine is linked to site metrics, hospital, south, south.
And then if you have another family medicine rotation, that&#39;s offered at a different hospital FM, and let&#39;s say, this is going to be at Metrix hospital Southeast and save that.
So now we have two family medicine rotations being offered at two different places. So that&#39;s how we are setting up the rotations.
Every instance of that, a rotation that happens at different hospital will be added a separate entry and linked to the appropriate site.
And each of these rotations can also have supervisors, administrators that are part of that. And those individuals will have accounts in the system.
And we&#39;ll be getting to that as a, uh, as a next part of the setup for now, the first part is the sites and then the rotation names that are linked to that.

So for this task that we just recently completed, I wanted to, uh, make some design tweaks. So the first thing is that when we have these, um, items that are, um, longer text instead of a button, it&#39;s better for us to use what we use here, like, uh, uh, something more subtle so that it doesn&#39;t really, um, pop out on the, on the screen.
It&#39;s, it&#39;s better. We use something like this, where we have a link that says view more. Um, so we can copy from the dashboard, the other, uh, piece here when we have these buttons that are, um, next to each other, let&#39;s keep it consistent with, um, stay.
This is also not a great example. Let me see if I can find another one. See here, there, the spacing between them, this is what we should normally do.
I use everywhere. It&#39;s a, I think how many are, I think maybe one or one or two pixels, um, so that it looks cleaner.
And then for, um, when we do the, uh, groups, uh, we want to put this at the, uh, bottom, uh, instead of a floating in the middle with the same amount of space between that.
So sorta like we, what we have on the calendar, see with this line and then at the bottom, right?</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/002f7b616b474eacbaba14316981d6a7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Streams | Fellow - 14 December 2021</pre></td><td><pre>Thank you. So basically if I look at the first one, this is easy to do. I don&#39;t need to delegate, um, uh, cost created custom user field.
This is also something that can be easily done. This, uh, David is serving as a point of contact. You would just make sure that it stays in his radar and are, you know, huddle.
If by Thursday or Friday, we don&#39;t have it. This checked off. Then we need to say, Hey, we need to check in with them.
Finish the attending evil. This is for them. We don&#39;t need to do anything until next week. Um, if we want, we can do a little check-in on Next Friday, I told her we will review the, what she did in the next meeting.
Then user import, we have, David&#39;s going to send that over to them so that they have it again, checking with the status of the low score notification, Chris wasn&#39;t on the meeting.
So he is not gonna really know all the use cases. So what will we just need to check with them?
How soon it will be out, because if it&#39;s going to be out in the next week or so we should this new form that we&#39;re making sure just be set up properly instead of having them do the thing that I told them today and then having to change it.
Um, but if it&#39;s going to be out in a month for now, then we&#39;re not going to wait for that.
Right. Next thing is, yeah. Yeah. So anything that&#39;s in development, Chris is probably the best person to ask. Um, Rio may also know, but in terms of Chris is the one testing.
It, there usually ends up in his queue last. So this is something that you can test. Um, cause I remember in the call, I said, if an attending has a bunch of evils, they can approve it in bulk in the system.
But I don&#39;t know what happens when they get an email. Like when you click on a link, it goes to a page.
I think those pages just allow you to approve and then go to the next one automatically you can select a bunch of them, right?
So if that&#39;s how it works, then we can probably add a button that says approve, all right. Case law was or something, right.
Um, or we can make it so that they are, they have to log in and go into the system and do the bulk of rule there either way.
The first step is to figure out how it currently works by doing a test on demo, um, or on your learn dot metrics.
Um, and then, so this is a bug here where, Uh, I took a screenshot. So you can see we made a competency Val and there was an overlap here.
So for this one, you&#39;re not going to write the up. I don&#39;t want you to like get caught up with all of the write-ups it&#39;s, it&#39;s more of, you&#39;re going to communicate this with the Mike and Mike can take, Mike&#39;s a UX person you&#39;re going to, I would just make him a loom video in those loom videos.
You need to tell Mike where this came from. So I made this by going into the, uh, demo server and I created a competency question with these options.
And then I went to the assignments page and downloaded a PDF of that. So the best thing is Emily already did this on her.
So one of the devs can just pull down Emily&#39;s MSU server. They don&#39;t have to set up anything. All they had to do is go to the assignments page and see what, so it skips all the setup process.
So I would tell Mike, Hey, this is something that you can go to the MSU server on staging or production and see what Emily did.
I need to out to download the PDF. You&#39;ll see that this is coming up as overlap. And when he writes up the issue in that issue, he&#39;s going to tell the dev to pull up back up off the production database for MSU, and they will be able to see this problem and fix it.
So we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a copy paste thing or no, this is not a copy face thing. It&#39;s just a format.
They need to space this out. So if there&#39;s only so many options, it needs to use this full width of this bar.
So you can make that in a little video and then this next one HTML code showing in the admin portal.
So if you go to here on the assignments page, if I open up and again, I would just use, um, MSU server, because if you wanted to do it yourself, you would ask to take the time to go to demo and recreate it.
So save the time and let the, and tell Mike to make sure to include this in this instructions for the developers, because otherwise they&#39;re not going to be able to recreate it.
And if they don&#39;t, we don&#39;t tell them to go to MSU. So there&#39;s, here&#39;s the two problems here. One is this HTML code shouldn&#39;t be showing here.
Do you have tags? It should just be showing in separate lines. Then there&#39;s no rotation shown here. But on the, when we looked on the personal portal, the rotation digital up here.
So for some reason we need to fix this book. So the name of the rotation neurology was what we select it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b5299265c32049f083c4746936cd248f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>MSPE + Student Report</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jessica. So reviewing these two documents that you sent over this first thing is a great report. This looks very straightforward and simple.
And what we could do is incorporate this as a custom report, um, into, well, not a custom report, a great report.
That&#39;s part of the platform and have it, have it, um, ready for you by the next, uh, the second onboarding next August.
So this is something that we can commit to do, and we have included that in our proposal. Um, again, this is for the, uh, by the time of preclinical stars that we can incorporate this.
And since, as long as you&#39;re okay with that timeline, we can do it at no cost. If you need to have it done sooner.
Um, depending on the timeline we would, we could, we could do it for a custom development fee, um, if, if that&#39;s needed otherwise, uh, given that we have a year, we can include that in our normal development and have that added as for this, uh, MSPE, uh, we already have a way to automate part of this.
And, um, this is the, the document generation tool metrics, which allows you to create a template. They can just use our formatting tools to create the document.
It, uh, includes the ability to, uh, include the logo, insert image. Uh, I just didn&#39;t add it here when I was messing around with this.
And there&#39;s also a way to, um, populate their first name, last name. There are some things like the, the notable demographics.
Um, we don&#39;t have a way to add a custom demographic fields into the here yet, but that&#39;s part of our updates that we&#39;re working on now and the ones that&#39;s us done.
You can put these as custom demographic fields for the profile and what I was added there. It will appear in here, same with some of these other fields.
Um, but even if you wanted to get started today, uh, now, and start creating a style and a standardized template and just have blank sections in here so that whoever&#39;s working on the MSP can just generate it.
It&#39;ll populate the basic information and they want to manually create the rest. You could do that, but once our updates are done, you&#39;ll have these custom fields that can be added and populate this additional information.
And the third piece of it is the performance data. So there&#39;s all of these charts and performance data that needs to be added.
This is something that needs to be customized to your organization. So we&#39;ll likely, uh, whenever, um, towards probably the middle of next year, um, we can work with your team to add a custom, uh, template fields in here for the match, your organization&#39;s performance data, and this will populate it with the charts and layout, and that will require custom development.
Um, we&#39;re not able to provide a quote for that part right now because we have to finish our project updates.
And some of the things that we do we&#39;ll we&#39;ll cover most of what you need. And when the time comes, if we need to add these charts, we could, um, provide you with a flat rate for that, and that will allow you to have it fully automated.
So either you&#39;ll have the option to just partially automated and then use it and put the chart to yourself, or we can do a custom project to have it fully automated.
And I also want to let you know, this is the same project, a similar project that we&#39;re doing for, um, uh, Talem.
They are going to be using it for automation of your, their MSPE. Um, and then as part of that, we&#39;re also going to be doing, uh, customizing the, their template to put their performance data in there.
This is the one thing that&#39;s hard to standardize because each school, uh, shows information slightly different. So those are the two things.
Uh, so this, this part we&#39;re going to be including in the, have included in the proposal for the MSPE part.
Um, we have a section in there that outlines what updates we&#39;re adding, and then for the performance data, um, um, probably after our updates are done, we can provide you with a quote for having these charts and, uh, that is unique to your organization added to the template.
Um, it&#39;s going to be something reasonable and to be a one-time fee, just setting it up and you can keep using it over and over each time you need to, uh, populate it with the, a MSP.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e921c45453524e7f90bbc1278b54d728</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Lab - Calendar - October 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So Maria for, we have written up issues for this one and for the M One up here.

We can write that up as a book where it should not keep that, um, image from a, it just stopped that image as soon as the page is loaded.
Okay. I&#39;m trying to see if there&#39;s anything else. So under the user profile. So when you go to the user&#39;s page, open up a user&#39;s account and go to the exam scores tab, we can update the buttons here to use our new buttons, which is the standard edit, delete, and View buttons over may open up.
Um, So if I go to let&#39;s say one of the newer pages, We have edit and delete icons here, and we don&#39;t have a view button, but if you go to sites, for example, this is a view button that will open up a modal.

The problem that we&#39;re facing is the groups sometimes have several, you know, 50 to a hundred, maybe 150 groups linked to this course.
So in order to address this, um, this page becomes very long. And so we&#39;re going to try to make this a little bit better by making it so that if there are more than let&#39;s say, um, um, if there&#39;s more than a six groups, we will show it as, um, um, 23 groups.
We just basically showed that the count. And when you had to click on the count or the group to bring up the model for updating and seeing what the groups are linked to it, and we&#39;re also going to move this groups button to this, this column, um, and, uh, show it at the top.
If there&#39;s, um, nothing shown, we&#39;ll just see the plus groups button. If there&#39;s, if there&#39;s a, you know, five or six of them shown, then it&#39;ll show it underneath that.
And then if they click on either the selected groups or the button, it&#39;ll bring up the model to edit and update the groups.
A couple of other minor changes we want to do here is if we can make this course in rotation, uh, twenty-five percent less width so that it doesn&#39;t, um, uh, these other columns are a little bit of wider and it doesn&#39;t get, looks much like this, so we can even it out.
So they have a little bit more space and use some of the space from the, uh, course in rotation to make that, make that arrangement.
And then let&#39;s also bold the title of the course, all the title. And then on this page, we always want to, uh, just show, um, just show pure text the, with this, uh, description field for courses, a Wiziwig editor.
Uh, but if there&#39;s any sort of text formatting, we want to ignore that and just show it in text so that we&#39;re not ruining the page a formatting.
Um, and then we can also have a maximum number of, uh, characters here, maybe like, um, let&#39;s see, uh, like 300 characters.
And if there&#39;s more than 300 characters, we can say like view more and bring it up in a, um, a model, the, uh, the, the course, um, details.
And we already have a model that can be used for this Where, sorry. All right, sorry. Uh, we don&#39;t have to produce a model.
We can just say view more and it&#39;ll just expand and show if there&#39;s more than 300 characters. So just to review all the changes we&#39;re making.
So the first thing is we want to make sure that if there&#39;s more than six characters, six groups, we show the count instead of listing everything out, we&#39;re going to move the button for adding groups and editing groups to this second column.
I&#39;m sorry, the groups column. And then if there is a, if there is a click on the groups or the, um, if there&#39;s account and you click on account, it&#39;ll bring up the same model so they can update the groups.
And then for making some more space on this, we&#39;re going to want, we want to widen the duration directors and groups, um, and the action column.
So they&#39;re not all smushed. And then we&#39;ll, um, um, we&#39;ll slightly decrease the width of the course in rotation so that we may have some more room for that.
And then I just thought of one another. One of the things that we can do is, um, um, when we have the course in rotation, bold, the course name, and then also put a character limit of 30 characters, said 300 characters for the description.
If there&#39;s more than 300 characters, show a view, more button view, all button, and then lastly it&#39;s, um, um, let&#39;s see, that&#39;s it?
Yeah, that&#39;s it.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5f6bc69b129c44aeae7fc99479675c15</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Curriculum</pre></td><td><pre>And the second part I wanted to introduce our curriculum module. The curriculum component of metrics is something that is typically made available to our UME clients, for medical schools to build out all of their academic careers curriculum for preclinical and clinical, um, training.
It is a very large module that allows the organization to do a lot, including mapping the curriculum to the AMCs accreditation standards and things like that.
But from a residency standpoint, as we talked about, there is a potential use case here where each department can create a, a, um, a course for their training program, um, which has internal medicine or family medicine.
And then each course can have a variety of different sessions. So these sessions are meant to be lectures that are given and a session can have the speaker, the, um, the content.
And then you can also have key words on what is taught there, the different, uh, attachments such as, uh, um, PowerPoints or lectures that are tied up to tie to that it can all be linked to this session.
And then when the, uh, the content is taught students, uh, the residents can be scheduled to this session and these sessions will show up on their calendar.
Are they able to download the content and view everything? Um, um, as they would on a regular calendar event, the objectives, um, can also be created for each, uh, session.
And then that can be mapped to some, uh, global objectives with data if that&#39;s needed. But the core thing is, uh, having a series of lectures, uh, content associated with it, organize it, and then you can able to roll it over from one academic year to the next.
And just to come back to the calendar functionality, our metrics calendar is something that brings the clinical schedules as well as the lecture schedules together on one page.
So if I want to go back to this, uh, example we were looking at in the other video, um, and I go to the calendar.
You can see this calendar has a series of lectures that are happening on a daily basis. Attendance can be taken using a QR code.
And then if I were to look at this resident from a, um, individual schedule, you can see that his rotation schedule his clinic, schedule his lecture, schedule all coming together on one page.
And this is how the residents see this calendar. And if I click on it, then I&#39;m able to download a different piece of content from it, uh, if they&#39;re linked to it.
So the curriculum component is something like I said, is not something that typically made up, uh, available to, uh, residency programs.
But if this is something that the department has an interest in using, we can make that available, um, as part of the full system to build out the residency programs curriculum.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6db572f82e5f4cdcbd171d3af551fcd2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>let&#39;s, uh, eventually we&#39;ll get out to the other types, but right now you&#39;re just going to be shown rotation. So if I arrive Here, I got a check.
I&#39;m going to select evaluation as the first module. I mean, as the module, and then I&#39;m going to, Once I select evaluation, I will be given a Thing that says select Context, And this will have a dropdown blank.
It wants me to select something. So this dropdown will have the three options in it. Three options, Options, Evaluation type status.
And then next, what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to select, I&#39;m going to select, let&#39;s say I pick evaluation type.
It keeps doing that. The evaluation type is selected. Now, once I select evaluation type, it&#39;s going to know that I entered one.
And it&#39;s going to say, you want to trigger The evaluation type. I&#39;ll tell you once I select this, it&#39;ll give me one more criteria to pick the right side of it or whatever one I don&#39;t care.
But this is saying evaluation type is this. And you have to pick, this is going to be a dropdown with all the evaluation types listed in there.
Okay. And then I click add another trigger. And then This will let me Pick A new trigger, which is going to be, give me the same dropdown again.
But with now with two options, I guess I will have, and Now I can choose what, what is, what do we have remaining?
We have assignment date, the assignment or status, doesn&#39;t matter. It all just getting joined the other. And then this will also, this will, this particular one will have a field.
Let me type in a number because Yeah. You&#39;re not selecting from the List. It&#39;s exactly. And Some Days then now, like it still has one more option I can potentially select.
So it&#39;s going to still show at another context. And then let&#39;s say, if I pick that, Now this is going to not show anything else and it&#39;s going to Automatically know what the remaining One is that we can do.
We can basically either just show dropped down with just one or just show the last one And select. So that&#39;s also an end, right?
Yeah. Yes. So this trigger will only happen if all of these criteria are met and there&#39;s all those criteria are met, then we&#39;re going to look into who should we send this to, Um, an audience.
So this, this, this whole process, again, repeats to select audiences. So now we have an audience dropdown with these items on here.
I select site leaders, and then I can do, I had another audience. Okay. And that will, if I want to do just, I&#39;m not going to do it.
But if I wanted to, I would select, let&#39;s say, if I select a rotation, administrators, I can choose roles for that.
If I, if I just choose evaluate teas, there&#39;s nothing to select. There&#39;s only one. Right. And so, but you can do, and for this also, and then let&#39;s say, I want to send it out to a site directors, site leaders and the evaluators.
Okay. So, um, and then the other thing I didn&#39;t really talk about in this design is how you make a mistake.
You want to be able to remove it, um, That had a backpedal or just Exhale X out of this. And then the other, um, thing that we can do is on these.
Um, when you add an audience, if you add more than one audience, we can also let them specify. Let&#39;s say, if I want to, for the sake of this example, we&#39;re going to continue this and we&#39;re going to, Yeah.
I think you&#39;ve got to look name and frame sometimes to make it easier. Yeah. Oh yeah. So right. Click On it.
And then, uh, say apply frame is a short way of doing it. Yeah. Like a, and then I&#39;ll take everything inside of that.
I put it on top And then you just drag the name. Oh, Oh, I need to get better habits in here.
So this, this, um, so let&#39;s say if I add and evaluate PS, we can say, if you add more than one audience, we can let them specify whether, um, it should be a two or CC.
Oh, I see. &lt;inaudible&gt;. They can say how they&#39;re being added to email. That&#39;s cool. PCC. So this way, the first one is always going to be too, because you don&#39;t want to send out an email to all BCC OCC.
So the first of the first audience set is going to be the two. And then the other ones, if you add more than one set of audience, you can just let you choose whether.
Yeah. So let&#39;s say you email the evaluate T you may want to also CC the site director. Okay. Yeah. So I think, I think if you sort of look at this and I don&#39;t think you need the other video, actually, you can just look at the, I&#39;ll send you this video and this, this update integrated into what re already made will address both use cases.

Um, a few things that we can really, uh, uh, like we can really, uh, promote to the customer.
Clients is how easy it is to start a project and then filter by the projects. Um, we can change this to like just projects because this is going to be a centralized page that they can see everything across the institution.
Um, and then from a, I also liked the fact that you can search and filter based on different criteria on one page.
Um, a couple of, um, Hey David, I&#39;m just finishing up a recording for Rio one second. So from the, on the projects page, one of the one thing that I was wondering is if there&#39;s a way for us to use that same drawer functionality that we use for sites, so that when you click view, it shows up on the right side and week on the, on that page.
Being able to have a tab where you can add tasks, um, having a second tab where they&#39;re going to attach documents, um, or even like in the future, having a discussion on a third, another tab, um, this way it&#39;s a one project page where you can see everything.
Because right now, in order for me to see information, I have to open up the view. Then that&#39;s where I can see the documents and the details of the project.
Then I have to close it and then go to a separate page where I have to look up tasks. Um, and the tasks are also going to have comments associated with it.
Um, if there&#39;s a way for us to use that drawer, if you like, it&#39;s pretty powerful because it gives you a whole page, um, that centralizes everything about the tasks and you don&#39;t have to open and close windows to do certain things on there.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/71d53963d98946bbb49293ebf4997399</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>File Formats Supported by WebViewer | PDFTron SDK</pre></td><td><pre>So for this particular update, we want to try and use the PDF dot J S uh, um, library and make the, um, Make all of our documents open in PDF dot JS.
So right now we have only implemented it on a one specific page for PDFs, but we want to try to use that for all of the available file types and then implement that on all pages that we have documents.
So let&#39;s take a look at the different pages on the institutional level. If you go to Uh, user&#39;s profile, they have documents attached to documents and certification.
So on this page, when they do have a document, um, we want to be able to click on it. And also, and also add a, sorry, We want to add a, a view and download button here, a button here.
So instead of writing out full text here, we can just have view, download, edit, and delete icons. Uh, so there are smaller and so similar to the way that we have in some of the other pages Actually like this, but without the text, this way, they&#39;re able to use a page without it getting misaligned.
So documents and certifications. Then on the manage documents page, same thing. We want to be able to view Whenever they&#39;re expanding it, we want to be able to click a, have a view button so they can view the file in the PDF, John PDF dot JS viewer, same thing in the personal documents in resources.
If they&#39;re opening up a file, we want to have a, a view icon so they can open it up and view it there In a requirements.
If they have a completed document and they bring it up and click, uh, next to, if we can have a download button and their view button, if they click the view button, it&#39;ll opens up and they can see the contents without having to download it.
Same thing in the active requirements documents. When they open up a file On the site&#39;s page, if I&#39;m on the documents tab, in addition to the download button, we want to add a view button so they can view it in PDF dot JS Now to the admin portal.

The problem we have here is that the groups, sometimes they can have 5,200 groups in here, and this can be a very long page.
So in order to address this and a couple other usability problems and make some tweaks here first, um, what we can do is widen the spaces of the, um, duration directors and groups columns a little bit, and the action column, so that it&#39;s not all smushed into one, um, space here so that they have some more breathing room.
And then we can also, we can make some room by decreasing the size of the course and rotations by about, um, 25% of what it&#39;s now.
And then once that&#39;s done, we&#39;re going to make some design changes. The first thing is we&#39;ll, if there&#39;s more than six groups, let&#39;s just show the count.
Like as 23 groups selected, if there&#39;s less than six groups, we&#39;ll just show the actual group names. And then let&#39;s also move the groups button to the ad groups, button to the groups column here so that, um, there are like this and we can move the, um, we can make sure that delete and edit buttons that are next to each other.
Um, let&#39;s also make sure that the course title is bold. And then lastly, uh, for the description field, if this put a 300 character limit, if there&#39;s more than 300 characters, we&#39;ll have a view, view, more button and we click on it.
It&#39;ll just show the rest of it and expand it just like we do on the, uh, dashboard, the announcements. And then lastly, if there&#39;s any HTML that&#39;s entered into this description field, let&#39;s ignore that on this page and just show the text so that if there&#39;s any, um, um, you know, like bold or anything like that.
So big because this description field has a Wiziwig editor, but we don&#39;t want to show that formatting on this table view.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7fcfb5d0f0c042f08a0f9802d2417e17</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this Bob, you got to log into sandbox. And if I go to sandbox, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s two programs here.
There&#39;s actually three, but these two are the ones that matter. If I go to the programs page and I open up this particular one, you&#39;ll see this one has a curriculum.
So we have the ability to create a curriculum for a particular program, or we can create, uh, a program can use another program&#39;s curriculum.
So you&#39;ll see that this one is said to have a primary curriculum. And the second program is also set to have a primary curriculum, but if I log in and I go to, so this is one program and I go to program objectives.
Okay. So you&#39;ll see that I made in the school of medicine, I made these objectives. Um, but if I go to the mapping page, you&#39;ll see, um, that it is actually, it is showing up correctly, the mapping page.
And then I go to course and objectives and I go to the objectives page and I choose anatomy, have it here.
And then I go to the mapping page anatomy load, and we&#39;ll show it here. And then I go to sessions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/707e3439f0fe4d768309f40241e72431</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Intro</pre></td><td><pre>Hello, Erin wanted to create this video summarizing some of the things that we talked about, and it&#39;s going to be a quick run through of a metrics.
As a introduction. Metrics is a platform that is used for managing a small or large GME department, which supports all different types of, uh, uh, specialties.
And this is something that we are able to deploy and, and, uh, implement and, and migrate data from other systems.
So that if an organization has been using another system, we&#39;re able to move the data over and implement it for all of the departments or just as one department.
So today I&#39;m going to be focusing on just one department as an internal medicine department. So I&#39;m logged in as a program director here, but you can see here if I have residency programs or fellowship, I can have them all of them in one system and be able to toggle between them.
So this is what metrics looks like as a program administrator program director. And you can see, um, one of the things that we do is we focus a lot on usability and trying to make it a, uh, engaging platform for all, uh, everybody that&#39;s using it.
This includes the administrators, but also more importantly, the residents and faculty who have to go in there and submit the data.
Um, so if I open up one of our residents here, John Dorian, I can see his profile and it&#39;ll show me all of his academics, uh, data in one place, including his, uh, demographic information, his, um, training history, attendance data for conferences, exams, work hours, case logging documents, and certifications such as onboarding paperwork, scholarly activity records all in one place.
And, um, as a department metrics also allows you to create your schedules. So there are, um, you don&#39;t need to use any other platform for scheduling.
If you&#39;re using, uh, metrics, you can use your blog, create your block schedules, who shift schedules, um, for your clinics and on-call.
And all of that is, uh, uh, set up in a way that it&#39;s customizable to each department, their, um, block dates and, um, start and end times, and each clinic and a on-call shift, our managing our shift schedules.
And this is something that allows a chief residents have flexibility to create what they want and make changes in real time.
And all of this changes is presented to the residents in their portal, which cannot be sinked with their, um, personal devices, such as iPhone or a Google calendars.
And you can see that, um, these are shift schedules for a clinic and on call, if I click into any of these shifts is how easy it is to assign someone to it and then make changes to the shift times if we need to.
And when it comes to, uh, evaluations, metrics supports full automation of all of your evaluations for the department. This includes, uh, collecting rotation based evaluations, program evaluations, peer evaluations, and even evaluations for different lectures that are held during the day such as your didactics.
So, um, there are different templates that can be used, meaning templates, meaning just, uh, um, how they&#39;re using the system.
They, we allow you to create any questions in the system, and every question can be mapped to the ACG MES, uh, uh, milestones, if you, if you want to do that.
So if I click click on one of these forms and click at it and go to manage questions here, you can see, these are some of the questions that were created by a department.
And if I want to edit one of these, I can change the text on here. Um, and then if I take a question, I can also link them to the ACG MES, uh, milestones.
So we have all the milestones 2.0 loaded in here also for internal medicine are ready to go. And most importantly, the automation rules allow these forms to be distributed based on the work schedule.
So the work schedules are updated evaluations that are automated.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/604be9b6b89f40e8bbc111e65b9b31e6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Another important setup for new institutions are the custom demographic fields. So we&#39;ll take a look at where the demographic fields are stored.
If you remember, we have four major user types. There are faculty, staff, resident, fellow, and student. So if I added resident or fellow user, you&#39;ll see that there are a bunch of fields here and there are also a bunch of fields on the right side.
Um, there, there&#39;s going to be important things that we need to discuss later about some of these fields at this time.
The key thing to note is that we have standardized fields, but if they want to add additional fields, we have a way to do that.
And they end up on the additional info section off their demographics. So if you are on the users page and you edit a user, you can edit those demographics.
Or if you click the view profile, it will allow you to view what&#39;s already in the system. And you can see here, it follows the same structure.
As the other page, we have accountable a certification and for, um, citizen status, emergency contacts, the category. So these categories are the additional info categories or custom categories.
So we&#39;ll take a look at how we create them. So under system set up user fields. What we can do here is create categories.
So this could be Favorites and under favorites. We can have different fields here. Let&#39;s say Poof, And we can have this as long text, short text, select one or multiple choice.
So select one, we&#39;ll say pizza. Then we can decide that we want this to be available for the residents and the students, but not for the faculty and the staff.
So I&#39;ll save that. And then it&#39;s, it&#39;s, uh, something that we need to have a discussion with the institution and see what information they want to track and then specify what fields they need to, uh, enter that into.
And then which type of user those fields should be created for. And then once that&#39;s made by make or edit any resident user and go to additional info, I&#39;ll have a favorite section with the option to select favorite food.
And these other ones were already in the system. So once those demographic fields that are created under the demographics section profile, we can create reports that export this so we can create, let&#39;s say all active users from all the programs, all the roles, and come down here under additional info.
We can select a category to export the favorites here. So we have the way that it appears here as a field name and the category name to the right side of it.
So favorite food and our favorites. And we can export that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/10125ef2b29543a4bbee3df905f499f0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Bugs</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So there&#39;ve been a few different bugs that I&#39;ve been documenting. Um, while I was testing out the system or setting up the demo data.
So for example, I&#39;ll just go through these one by one in the sandbox, sorry, it&#39;s not sandbox in the curriculum module.
You go to school of medicine and then go to curriculum Map. How do we select a course? If it&#39;s a big screen, like the one that I have right now, which is like a two K monitor, everything shows up.
But if you go to a smaller computer, then it gets cut off here and it&#39;s, you can&#39;t be the data past this.
And the other problem we have here is normally that was my dog. Uh, in the, in the, on this page, normally you would see any mapping that was missed.
So the way that this is supposed to work, as you have your curriculum map, you have your global objectives and there&#39;s map to course objectives, which accrue up more mapped to a session objectives.
And you can review that by going to the mappings page on each of these, and you&#39;ll see you can drag and drop and you can make a mapping here.
Um, so this one is mapped with this one here and so on, but if you forget to map one of these, so for example, this, uh, essential one is not mapped to show up as a red.here on this level.
They&#39;d be a red dot below somewhere that says this particular one is not mapped. We no longer have that showing up.
It&#39;s supposed to be on this tree, this one. So that&#39;s the second book for this piece.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/382eb79550a44f519270196c22e7ba5a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, everyone. I wanted to send this video explaining some of the documents that we&#39;re sending over. So our team had an internal meeting today just to review all of those keywords and figuring out a good game plan.
So, first thing that I want to share is, um, this first document that we&#39;re sending over a call to Ross&#39; keywords and system.
This has all of the keywords that have been added to the platform by different faculty members. It&#39;s it has, um, many problems with it such as like there are spacing issues and there&#39;s also some, um, um, duplicates in here.
And the other thing is also, it, it, it does get pretty granular. And one of the things that I feel like it&#39;s better for the school to do is, um, instead of getting so granular with the keywords, be a little bit more broad, because when you&#39;re looking for reporting, like if you have keywords that are talking about specific enzymes, um, you&#39;re not going to have too many other sessions that cover the same enzymes.
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s not, there&#39;s not really much linking going on. So these keywords are mainly used for linking different topics together, so that you&#39;re able to see where similar topics are taught.
But if the, if the keywords are so granular, like the name of a protein, it&#39;s probably not going to be used more than once.
And it ends up being not very useful for seeing relationships, but if you go on a higher level and if it&#39;s talking about like certain types of proteins, and then it&#39;ll be easier to find different lectures that cover the same types of proteins.
So, um, this is the keywords that are in there. You can review it. It&#39;s going to be difficult to keep much of these because of the fact that they don&#39;t have, um, they were just randomly added, I think, uh, um, and it also is going to be difficult to sort of match this up with the mesh keywords.
But, um, I want to just leave that there and then going to the actual mesh document. So this is the original mesh hierarchy that we have here.
And after looking through this, there&#39;s about 61,000 terms in here. And I feel like that&#39;s very, very broad and, uh, uh, coverage of everything.
And then each of these, um, more granular terms get very specific. So what we try to do is we try to truncate the, the keywords to the second level.
So if we go a zero one that&#39;s body region and then a zero, uh, the second, uh, uh, section in this coding structure, whereas this 1, 1, 1, and 2, 3 6, when we get to that level, then we&#39;re getting more granular, but it&#39;s also a not too granular.
Um, so it gives us about, I think, 3000 some odd keywords. Let me have another document that shows that, Okay, this one, Nope.
Paradise. So this document shows the keywords that are just to the second level of the hierarchy, and that has 2000 keywords.
And I feel like, um, and then I, I think, uh, we, as a team, Maria also had a lot of experience with curriculum mapping.
She went through this and, uh, her recommendations also, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/cdacc70020264ba6b2655fe8158ff7df</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Email Notification – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hi marina for this new feature that we&#39;re building, we&#39;re going to be working on creating an email notification system and do do this.
Um, this is a first, um, draft, the first version of this it&#39;s going to lead to, to have one new notification and we&#39;re going to be hard coding, a lot of stuff real is working on the interface for this.
So the first thing is on the left menu, we&#39;re going to add a communications, uh, uh, page and on this page, we&#39;ll have a way to create a new notification.
So on the new notification, first, there&#39;s going to be method type is going to be an email announcement SMS, but in this, uh, this is going to be hard coded for now.
So it&#39;s going to be just email and there&#39;ll be able to select a module that want to create a notification.
For first, we&#39;re going to only just have curriculum, press continue. This will allow them to select a trigger, only have sessions, scheduled data as a trigger, and then allow them to select one or more session types, and then who the audience will be.
So the audience in this case, since this, uh, uh, session notification will either be session members or session leaders. These are people that are going to assess scheduled their curriculum session, and then they click and continue.
And this second part we&#39;re going to skip. This is where they can create a custom message. But, um, for this, um, for a first version, we&#39;re not going to let them customize it.
It&#39;ll just be a delivery method is going to say, uh, um, relative delivery date based on trigger scheduled date. And we&#39;re going to say X days before the trigger date, and they can add more than one.
So they add, you know, uh, 10 days before this trigger session scheduled date two days before session scheduled date and so on for specific dates.
And they can turn these re uh, check boxes on to set that up. And once this is set up, we&#39;ll create a Cron for it.
And I&#39;ll send out this email notification, um, here that will look like this. And this is a design that we have from, uh, that we created recently from the HTML email notification task.
I mean, look that up for you. H T M L so 2 8 2 5, we worked on a task to update the HTML email notification.
And then that is, it has an, a email notification for calendar events. And that&#39;s what this design is based on.
It&#39;s already mobile optimized. If you want to copy the code from there, unfortunately we haven&#39;t deployed it yet. And it&#39;s going to show the session named session type, how many days until the event, and then, um, the session description.
We&#39;ll also going to show the school&#39;s logo at the top and the line of community session, a course code session, name, date, and time with the time zone at the end of it.
Oh, so I think this is something that Rio is gonna work on the front end, and then we&#39;re going to need your help with the backend.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4a9c3f1c7ae45d7a9f912b2d428f1ac</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So this outbound police shows up under medical school programs. And what we have here is a way to actually probably let me just start with my designers first.
We can find it. Yeah. So this was my initial mock-up, um, where you start with this page and then you click new notification and I have three tabs where you go through, you select a module, you say curriculum, and then you say that I&#39;m creating a notification for curriculum.
Then what is a trigger that I want the trigger to be the, in here we&#39;ll have mostly going to be dates that you can pick, or it could be a, some criteria.
And, um, so we also need to be able to add more than one criteria so that it works together and then it&#39;s gonna be used for, um, what do you want to include after the trigger?
So it&#39;s going to be including, um, session types. So you can say like course session types or whatever it is, and then you, and then the audience is going to be who within all of these filters are getting sub selected based on what you&#39;ve picked evolve.
So if I picked curriculum, then these dates are only going to show, or these triggers are only going to relate it to the curriculum and then session, uh, types going to be selected and allows them to say, so you P you picked a session scheduled date that is now telling the system that you&#39;re dealing with sessions.
So now you need to say, do you want it to send that to all the sessions or some of the sessions?
So we&#39;re going to specify that by there&#39;s a session type in the future, we may add some other criteria that lets them sub select sessions, but right now we have such type.
And then within the sessions, there&#39;s going to be people linked to those. So they&#39;re going to be linked in different ways.
So you have, it could be session members or session leaders. So, and once that is set up, the next thing is to create the actual content.
And then it&#39;s going to be, the delivery is going to be either relative delivery or specific dates. So you can have more than one relative delivery saying two days before, three days before and so on.
Okay. Um, so that&#39;s what we built here. And Rio did his own tweaks on the interface and which is fine instead of a separate tabs.
He has it opening up in a model, uh, like in a continuous manner, which I, I it&#39;s good. And I, oh, one thing that I think we should change here is it&#39;s not good to have so many items, um, having in a modal, this is better in a separate page because what just let just happen will happen to people.
There&#39;ll be trying to build it and then they&#39;ll lose the mode. They accidentally lose a model and they lost all the work, right?
So models are not great when you&#39;re dealing with so much data entry. So it&#39;s probably better to turn this into a separate page then, um, or I guess we can like lock down the page thing so that you have to press X or save to close this.
Um, but that, then you&#39;re doing something different than all the other models. Um, so, so what we have here, let&#39;s go through the same thing as name of the, what is this notification name?
So in mine, I didn&#39;t have a notification name. Then we have the content. So we&#39;re going to have this block of content show at the top of the standardized email that we&#39;ll be creating for each of these notifications we&#39;re creating, we&#39;re going to, we&#39;ll have HTML emails that are designed.
And then at the block, they&#39;ll allow them to customize the text, but that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at. And then what is a trigger module context?
Um, so, so this is, I&#39;m not a fan of how this is being organized here because you&#39;re setting the trigger.
Um, so like the module and then the trigger, and then randomly you have session type here. It, because it doesn&#39;t really scale to what, if you&#39;re doing a different module.
So I kinda, that&#39;s why I put this into, um, three different tabs here. So it&#39;s um, so this could be built out for various.
Yeah. And I, I don&#39;t think I address all the use cases here either because I&#39;m, I&#39;m sure mine has a lot of gaps too.
I was, but I think what we can do is you take a, take what we have the real worked on, and then what I have in there.
And the thing that we need to address is now in the, in this use first use case where we&#39;re going to do is focus on sending out emails related to evaluations.
So here, the module is going to be evaluations. The, um, um, the context is going to be, um, um, the evaluation submission dates.
It&#39;s not as nice as a evaluation assignment date. Okay. Evaluate an assignment date. And then what we need to do is send not emails when evaluations have not been completed after certain days.
Right. So in, so we, right now, you can only select a date and you can say stop before start or end or whatever, but that&#39;s not going to work for our next use case.
Right. So it has to be you select a date and then we have to add a way to put, um, So he&#39;s got one day there you can add or remove.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4563638de5e44cba94381f50d40a1727</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So for this task, we are now going to schedules, schedules, shift schedules, and either I can make a new shift schedule, I can open one of the existing ones.
And when you go to the manage shift templates here, we have the option to make a shift name and then create a start time and end time.
And the start date and end date on the right side, we have the ability to, um, put a pattern. Um, so this pattern right now is limited to one week.
So what we want to do is, um, give them the ability to build a pattern for up to four weeks.
So what I mean by that is, um, basically they will, we&#39;ll have like buttons here that say one week, two week, three week, four week.
And if I get click four week, I&#39;ll get a, um, 28 check boxes here with maybe the a S Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday can be underneath it.
And it can say week one, week, two week three, week four, and then four week one, I can put a pattern in one day, Wednesday, Friday, Thursday, we to maybe Tuesday, Friday, week three, maybe Saturday or Sunday, and then week four is some other pattern.
So this would be a four week pattern that they build. And from the start date to the end day, we will repeat that pattern so that it&#39;s allows them to build a schedule for the entire year using a specific pattern.
And all we&#39;re doing is just basically expanding this from one week to support up to four weeks and this repeating pattern.
And, uh, uh, here&#39;s something that I&#39;m thinking how it may work. So if I take this and repeat something like that, and then we&#39;ll just put one week, two weeks so on, and if I turn on the two weeks, for example, then I&#39;ll get a grade here.
&lt;inaudible&gt; to Okay. Something like that. Okay. And now if I put a start date of January 1st or December 31st, it&#39;s going to repeat this pattern every two weeks, starting with the first Sunday onwards and this starting with the F like if a January 1st is a Monday, it&#39;ll start from that Monday onwards and build this pattern for the entire year.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ec8e577e329c444db6686e4072a2ad9e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Guide to the Perfect Personal Statement for NIH Biosketch</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Gary. So for us to submit this a proposal tomorrow, we need to have biosketches for each of our investigators.
And this is a specifically formatted a CV for the application. And here is a sample that I found online and it starts off with some information at the top.
Um, I can help create this document for you, but I need some information from you. Maybe you can just dictate into it like a voice memo on iPhone and just send it to me and I can put together this document.
Um, so for example, at the top, we need to have a personal statement that follow something of this structure. Who am I including rationale, uh, for, you know, working on this project, any work in the past that has done, uh, uh, that is relevant to this project.
And then, um, why am I qualified including accomplishments, uh, you know, in, in work with the radiology and the department versus any sort of research, uh, that may be relevant to, um, providing, um, working on a project that is about radiology reports and the potential for us to have the impact on healthcare, um, with the success of this project and creating simplified patient friendly reports.
Uh, so it can just be a brief, uh, personal statement at the top that, um, and you can, you can simply just dictate it on your phone using the voice memo, and I can add into this format then after that we have, uh, positions and honors.
Um, so I know you have, uh, your CV has a lot on there. Um, I&#39;m going to pull, I&#39;ll try to pull some into here that, that, uh, are relevant and, uh, and send that for you to review when I, when I have that completed.
Um, but if you have anything specific that you wanted me to include, let me know. Otherwise I&#39;ll try to pull that as much as I can.
Um, some of them don&#39;t have dates. That&#39;s the only thing that, uh, uh, you may have to fill in after I move it over.
Then the last section, this is, um, also I need your help with is the contributions to science. So this section requires us to submit any prior scientific work that was completed by the investigator.
And this, if ideally, if this is like research, um, publications, then that would be that&#39;s relevant to this project. That&#39;d be ideal, but if not, um, anything that is close to what we are, um, working on as specifically about patient, uh, access to radiology reports, imaging, and, um, firstly I won&#39;t have the time to review all these right publications.
So if you can pick out up to five, um, past research projects or publications, um, and give me a brief summary again, you can just dictate it and send it to me on the phone.
Um, just describes a few sentences of what the project was and then I can put that plus a, um, citation to that.

So you have an idea of what the platform looks like.
And then whenever it&#39;s appropriate, we can do a more in depth demo. So this is what a metrics looks like.
And you can see this is a program administration dashboard, and for an organization of your size, you&#39;ll have different, uh, programs that are in metrics.
And each of them will have its own dashboards. And there&#39;s an institutional dashboard for GME administrators. And from a program perspective, we have certain things that we highlight on the, on the administrative dashboards, such as different Iris data that is incorrect.
We proactively look at the data and convey that alerts to different coordinators so that they can correct different, uh, problems with, uh, with their trainees.
Then there&#39;s also our user management, which has a directory of all of the trainees faculty members and staff. Each, each trainee also has different profiles that we can manage a variety of demographic information, um, education, histories, attendance, and so on, including documents and certifications with exploration tracking along the way.
On the left side, we have each of our different modules. I won&#39;t get into all of them. I&#39;ll just touch on the evaluations module for a second.
So evaluations is built in a way that it&#39;s it&#39;s, it ties directly into the ACG MES, uh, um, milestone requirements.
And each of our, uh, evaluations are built by the program. They have full flexibility to build, uh, templates and then put in rules on when that should be distributed automatically based on their schedules.
So every department has the capability of setting their own assignment rules and just preview what the assignment automation rules look like.
So each director or coordinator had can, can specify different, uh, assignment rules based on the rotation who should complete this form, setting the roles, evaluator roles of faculty members evaluating, let&#39;s say first and second and third year residents.
And when should it be assigned, putting in a rule saying two days before the end of the rotation and metrics uses our block schedule to distribute these evaluations and send out email notifications, addition to that, um, there&#39;s tracking for all of these evaluations and keeping, making sure that, um, compliance is high.
And if this is a demo system, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s 18% compliance here. Um, but otherwise it system automatically alerts the individuals to complete it and then remind some until it&#39;s done so that we can ensure maximum compliance.
There&#39;s also block schedules and shift schedules in here. Um, block schedules is your standard block schedule that brings in all the rotations and you&#39;re able to publish it and, uh, make sure it&#39;s thinking with it&#39;s thinking with their work hours and also any vacation time it&#39;s automatically updated on the schedule.
And all of this eventually ties into the Iris module where metrics is able to, uh, bring in schedules for each of the different sponsored institutions and, um, have a cost reports generated.
And we also are able to run all of the same tests that our CMS runs on that your data. So when, if there&#39;s a problem with some, some, one of the entries, you can correct it before actually generating that database and submitting to CMS.
It&#39;s a variety of different tests that is preloaded into metrics, and it can be either run by the institutional administrators or each of the programs, um, that are managing, uh, the data.
And so those are, those are just a quick preview of, uh, metrics. And just so you, that you have a idea of what it looks like and how it functions.
And then there&#39;s a variety of different modules that we can go into into more detail in the future.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0a0b43db8cdb4affb9ef03077c5704b4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, in this video, we&#39;ll take a quick preview of the metrics, curriculum module. So Metrics, curriculum module is part of the full platform and it is the foundation of the, the, uh, the system that can be used for managing various programs.
And as you can see, this one is set up for the school of medicine, but you can have a variety of different training programs such as nursing, allied health, um, all in one system.
And it&#39;s possible to toggle into a different system, a different program, and have entirely separate curriculum for that. So we&#39;ll stay in the school of medicine and you can see along the left side, we have a curriculum map, Which Allows you to visualize some of this data, but you can see here, the first step of the curriculum hierarchy is the global objectives.
So, which is the American association of medical colleges and their physician competency reference set. And then each school will have its own set of program objectives that can be created in the system.
It broken down into sections and a particular objectives that under each section you can see is possible to toggle and do different academic years.
And then there&#39;s also mapping tools that allow the, the objectives to be mapped from one academic year to the next, can you use a drag and drop tool to do the mapping?
This also has search capabilities, The Next level down. Do you have different courses that are part of the, the particular curriculum courses and any sort of clinical rotations that are offered?
This includes a search and also scheduling directly built into it. So if we have groups of students that are participating in a particular course, uh, we can link those groups directly to this.
This is just a test environment, and then each course has objectives. So this particular one has three objectives, but it can be as many sections and objectives for each one.
And this also allows mapping. So if I select the course and load the objectives for it, I can do mapping.
It&#39;s slightly different interface for this one. Go ahead and map from the course, all the way to the program objectives.
And then there are sessions underneath each of them. So every course can have sessions. These sessions include lectures, labs, and so on.
And sketch sessions can be scheduled to the academic year, had keywords that allow it to define different topics. And then each of these sessions can also have instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources sessions can also have objectives that are linked to courses.
So if I have a set of objectives for the session, it can be linked to a course And then everything can be searched.
There&#39;s A full search capabilities, built into metrics, and then there&#39;s variety of reports. Also, uh, we&#39;ll be getting into each, each of these during the, uh, the demo.
Um, but this was, I wanted to just share a quick preview of metrics and the overall structure of the curriculum module.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/070c4d2e2e2e44f9bfc3902249d65b51</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Meetings | Fellow</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, David. So for standardizing processes for onboarding the first step there is for us to, um, let&#39;s review this, uh, document here.
So what we could do is in, uh, let&#39;s, let&#39;s focus on decline that we&#39;re doing now, instead of trying to do all GME and UME stuff, we can start off by creating a folder in customer success.
Let&#39;s put it under customer success. And then there, we can say, um, client onboarding and then UME under there and under UME.
Um, we can, this templates that we have is this onboarding worksheet. I have, uh, the original document, which Maria was working on updating and once, um, so we can put this in there and every client that we&#39;re starting, the onboarding, we&#39;re going to be collecting this information.
And then there&#39;s also, we can also put the, all the, um, upload a copy of all the upload templates into a sub folder in there.
Um, where we, the ones that we created recently, the spreadsheets forgot the folder where they&#39;re in like these kinds of documents.
So we have this worksheet, we have this thing. And then the next thing that we need to have in there are, um, a document that we start for creating a meeting agendas and, uh, another document for email templates.
Um, we can do put let&#39;s, let&#39;s start making all this, uh, in Google doc and I will start copying and pasting email templates in there that as I&#39;m creating them and sending it out, and then eventually we can take those and put it into process.st.
Um, and then also create checklist for making sure that we do everything. And so, um, the worksheet, the templates, and then a document for star, for meeting agendas and the different meetings that we need to have.
Um, you can even take that, um, document that we made for the RFP and putting those, uh, sample meeting agendas into there.
And then the other Is email. The other one is with email templates that we can populate with emails as we&#39;re sending to them.
Then that&#39;s a good start for now. And once you SEM, once you share that, um, email templates, one, I&#39;ll start email copying and pasting my emails in there, and you can start turning those into generic templates and the meeting agendas.
I&#39;ll also copy and paste what I had so far with Chamberlain, and that can be also turned into more generic templates.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/698b4f163a2341caa4a75e6aa9a72097</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike, this flyer&#39;s looking really good. And I wanted to review a few of the, um, the topography stuff mainly.
Um, the one thing that I can keep, uh, noticing is they look just looks very crowded. Uh, when you look at the text, especially when you get to the bottom.
So, um, and also we&#39;re using too many font sizes and it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not really a clear hierarchy of, uh, the important items.
So I think we can, we can adjust that with some small changes. So for example, uh, when you&#39;re doing a heading and subheading, um, it&#39;s good to mix up the light and the regular sized bond of, um, wait for the bowl.
Wait, so then you can separate different things. So, um, I think, uh, we can either use Marriott &lt;inaudible&gt; and both of them should have light volt and regular.
Um, so I said, try light here. My, it might not work. Uh, we might be just keep, keep it as bold.
Uh, but the one thing is to try to have the font sizes match up a little bit. So &lt;inaudible&gt; Let me see this one.
I think I was looking up to see what the recommended sizes, um, &lt;inaudible&gt; 5, 6, 24, or 24 for the subheading.
And then for the text itself, we can try, um, 12 and see how that goes. And then for this Down here, let&#39;s try &lt;inaudible&gt; It&#39;s it&#39;s 24, this is 12 and then 12 again.
And then when you get down here, I was trying to think about ways for us to clean this up a little bit.
Um, so the call of action, instead of, um, it being the URL because no, most people are not going to go in there and type this out.
So, and we&#39;re trying to get tech savvy people so we can just make it, so you have scan the QR code to get to this form and the interest is can QR codes apply today.
Um, and then on the right side, in this sub, uh, the small section, you can put your contact information. Um, it should be metrics, lab.com, not metrics.com.
Fortunately, we don&#39;t own that domain. I wish we did. Um, and then we can also put, I haven&#39;t figured out a way to put the, uh, we&#39;re looking for three, I mean, five, uh, advisors.
Maybe we can put it, um, like somewhere above there &lt;inaudible&gt; Like that and say, um, instead of we&#39;re looking for saying, okay, So five advisors will be selected from various specialties, something like that.
Um, because the wording, instead of we&#39;re looking for, it&#39;s sort of like we are going to be selecting five. Um, so it makes it look, sound a little bit more enticing, but the other than that we&#39;re, it should be good to go.
So I&#39;ll send this to you and if you can try playing around with the font hierarchy a little bit, uh, we can, we can see if we can clean up that the, the crowded look.
And also when we, uh, try to spaces out a little bit, so making sure that we have enough white space around some of these items that it makes, it looks a little bit more cleaner at the bottom.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6f3973af5f3946f5b089836fd098f8d3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So for this particular, um, question, what we added was the ability to create administrative all the templates. And what Chris is suggesting is that there may be some instances where you want to create an admin only requirement, but they may want to only show that to the administrators in our design.
If you create an admin, only the resident can also see it, but they can&#39;t interact with it. Um, so we can add a second check box that says admin only, and then only, um, visible to the administrators.
So if the first checkbox is turned on the second check box, pick some becomes active and they can turn that on.
And this on. If your design, You can just add it to the, uh, this here. Um, one check box, then a second check box would under your name.
If it turned on, they could turn it on. And that would say Ali, um, visible to administrators. And so if that&#39;s turned on, then it wouldn&#39;t even show up on the personal portal for the student or whatever individual, sorry, on this page, it wouldn&#39;t be able to see it at all.
And then second more, um, complex, uh, or slightly more complex workflows. When these requirements are submitted, the administrators are reviewing them and approving them.
And after they approve them, we add those documents to the student&#39;s records. So if I go to a student&#39;s profile, I go to the documents and certifications tab.
We&#39;ll see those documents appear here after they&#39;re approved. While we want to do is, um, if the second check box is turned on, those documents will come here and it will have this checkbox also turned on, so that it&#39;s kept confidential from the student.
So, because if it&#39;s administrative only requirement, then we would want to make sure that the, um, student is also not seeing that.
Uh, it&#39;s all we&#39;re doing is, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3ddfc7d46c224382ac8a2828078029f8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Loom | Free Screen &amp; Video Recording Software</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, my bad. Uh, I started on that tab. Then I switched to another one, but I guess was set on the tab only.
Um, so let me do that again. So we had recently did a task where if you&#39;re downloading a rotation evaluation on the assignments page, it would add the header there.
So we want to reference that task and then update that to include the site name where, um, and we also want to add that information up here when you&#39;re looking at a rotation evaluation that we show the site cause in the world of medical school and nursing, um, they&#39;re all going to different hospitals.
So would they need to know the site where they&#39;re doing it in the ho in the residency market, they&#39;re all going to be in the same hospitals.
So they only need to know the rotation name. So for medical school, they need to know that up here and also in that PDF design.
Um, the second part was at second task was adding a sites filter here. So if we add a sites filter somewhere here, um, when they select a site, it&#39;ll pull up all the rotations for all the rotation evaluations that are linked to that site.
So, um, so we can call it sites. Uh, and then in parentheses, um, like, uh, in italics, like, like this, we can put it with, um, uh, explain our texts, um, only for evaluate rotation evaluation, so sites, and then next to it, we&#39;ll leave for rotation evaluation because otherwise it&#39;s not gonna work.
So it&#39;ll pull up any evaluation that are from rotations that are linked to that site. And down here, we currently don&#39;t show any, um, let me go to a internal medicine program here.
You&#39;ll see contact. It shows the rotation name, but, and the dates, but it doesn&#39;t show the site name. So we would want to, um, show the site name somewhere.
And I think, uh, I don&#39;t wanna ruin the design here because a lot of our pro clients already use the rotation name.
So I&#39;m thinking we can put it rotation name and then right under it, um, site name, and then the dates at the bottom.
So three roles.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f12700780eca4c6fb2ff700e16057046</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Oh, this, this problem. It&#39;s a bit of an advanced, a feature that we have. So one of the things that we can do in metrics is create a shift schedule.
And inside of that shift schedule, we&#39;ll have these shift templates. So for example, here we have the purple one is 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, and then we have the am shift happening two days a week.
Right now we don&#39;t have anybody assigned to these shifts, but, um, we can automatically fill these shifts if we want to using rules.
So if I go to the rotations and then go to our blue button here, I can select a shift continuity clinic.
And then say, Monday, I click a am shift. Let&#39;s say a Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and add rule. So what happens is anytime someone is scheduled to the comp continuity, I mean, sorry, the, uh, cardiac PDR pediatric surgery rotation.
So remember we have rotations being scheduled on the block schedule. And if I schedule someone to a block schedule for this rotation, they will also be added to the shifts on Monday, Thursday.
Well, I don&#39;t know why we shipped. This is a bug it&#39;s Monday, Thursday, Friday, Tuesday, Friday. I guess it&#39;s doing that because I clicked in that order.
Um, but anyway, this is automatically going to be updated, um, based on the rotation. So every month thing, I have a different resident coming in and being scheduled to cardiac cardiology, pediatric surgery, and each month they&#39;ll also be added to these shifts schedule.
The problem that an Halfman is having is you are going to be automatically putting them on these four days, but let&#39;s say on a Tuesday, a particular resident is not going to be covering that schedule for some reason.
She wants to go to the shift schedule and I think let&#39;s, let&#39;s actually do this. So we have people showing up, um, cardiac pediatric surgery and let&#39;s go to schedule Cardiology, pediatric surgery.
And for October 1st onwards, we&#39;ll put Bruce banner on there. And then if I go on, So I think we may have to, I don&#39;t think it happens instantly.
We may have to run a Execute auto for run, and then I&#39;m going to go back to that shift schedule Or internal medicine Continuity clinic.
Um, Let&#39;s make sure that schedules shift schedules let&#39;s make sure that&#39;s the correct one that we are selecting. Go to rotations, cardiac surgery, continuity clinic am shift Monday or Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
Oh, wait. This is the cry. Believe that&#39;s it. And let&#39;s go back to the schedules shift schedules, open this up.
It&#39;s going to put a new rule and box ships Open this up. So, Uh, I think I know what happened.
Go back to the schedule, make sure we publish all and then do it again. So I forgot to publish the block schedule and that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t getting added.
See, now you can see that Bruce banner is automatically added to Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday because he was added to the rotation.
So the plot problem that Ann Hoffman is having is she&#39;s going in here and removing Bruce from one of these shifts.
And so she&#39;s gone, he&#39;s gone from the 26th, but overnight we run this Auto shift for schedules and the user gets added back to the shift.
So all we need to do is if someone was removed from it, we have to make sure that that person stays off.
If someone manually removed Bruce banner from it, then we need to make sure that it stays off.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2cc7ae16527d4f8db3b562ac14868a62</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Beth. So we&#39;ve completed all of the forms. And at this time we have, uh, everything loaded to the physical therapy program.
Our plan is to, um, move them over to the other programs or make copies of these once you have reviewed them.
So here&#39;s what, uh, we needed your help with. Um, if you open up each of these forms on part one, you can check the name, the activation date.
It doesn&#39;t matter. Um, for the form type, we, for some of these forms, we try to figure out which type of form it is.
Um, so when you click change form type, it&#39;ll show you what types of forms are available and a description of this, something that anything that is linked to an event, which I believe are your courses, um, should be an event type.
If it&#39;s just a general survey that someone&#39;s completing and they&#39;re not evaluating any rotation or another person, then it can be a general survey, uh, such as the, uh, post residency feedback and exit survey.
Those can be just be general. Then there&#39;s the program evaluations. These are any evaluations of the program or evaluations of another person in the program, but, but not in the context of a rotation.
So let&#39;s say if it&#39;s a monthly or a, so let&#39;s, let&#39;s, let&#39;s say it&#39;s a form that you evaluate the mentor once or twice a year in that setting, it&#39;s not a rotation evaluation, it would be a program evaluation.
Then the rotation would be any of those mentor evaluations that are completed in the context of the rotation. And here you can also specify whether confidential feedback is necessary or not.
And then down here, if you want to be notified, when a particular form is submitted, you can turn this on.
If you put automatic alerts, it will allow you to, it&#39;ll send you an email for every submission you&#39;ve returned on manual alerts.
It&#39;ll at least specify. It&#39;ll give the evaluator the ability to trigger a notification. So typically these can be turned off because you don&#39;t want to be notified every time.
And if you need a, the person that&#39;s submitting the form to have a signature, basically a digital signature, you can turn this on, it&#39;ll ask them to sign that, sign it.
Um, then on the manage, um, questions page, you&#39;ll see all the questions that we created for this forum. We skipped using the question bank.
So after further discussion today, um, we basically abandoned the idea of using the question bank because there&#39;s not really any evaluation forms and have, um, any questions that are shared across forms in the same program.
So you have copies of the same form in different programs, but question bank is better when you&#39;re it&#39;s use cases.
When you have same questions being used on multiple, um, forms in the same program and it complicates things otherwise. So there&#39;s some questions that we created that in the question bank that we&#39;ll be removing or it&#39;s, it can stay there.
It doesn&#39;t matter, um, all of your forms right now that we recreated them and they all have the questions on the template itself.
So if you need to make any changes, all you have to do is go to the template and edit the questions directly on the form.
You don&#39;t even have to ever go into the questions page. And then if you come down here, um, so a classroom lab, faculty evaluation, um, this, I believe will be better as an event evaluation if it&#39;s a course evaluation.
So I changed that and then classroom, lab, faculty evaluation here, um, for Ivanti evaluation, it actually will attach the calendar event name and the person that gave the lecture automatically.
So I don&#39;t think these fields are necessary, uh, but we put them in there. If you figured, if you&#39;re going to be, um, if you want them to type that in, and then you can see here, if you edit these questions, you&#39;ll see our scale.
So it would be good idea to just check these, to make sure you&#39;re happy with the scale. And all of these questions will have a, a, um, option to turn on no feedback or not applicable.
So if that needs to be turned on, they can be turned on. Let&#39;s see this one should be a like text question.
All right. So, so some of these will need to be changed to a text question because they came in as a Likert.
All right. So let me save and continue. And on this last page, um, you can skip this for now. We&#39;ll talk about how to assign these.
Once we have copied them over to the different, uh, forms and different programs, so simply, um, review them to make sure you&#39;re happy with the anonymous setting.
Um, and that&#39;s on this first page, whether you want it to be confidential or not. So if you, if something needs to be confidential, you can leave that checkbox turned on.
Otherwise he can uncheck it. Uh, anything where you&#39;re evaluating a faculty or evaluating the program typically should be confidential. So the trainee feels confident in submitting the evaluation and, uh, without getting into trouble.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/42511d6cb25343aabcfec567d08ec2e9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So this is a couple of small issues. When you&#39;re going into a procedure here to edit. Um, if it&#39;s a medical school, school of medicine, Let&#39;s go school of medicine and then go to cases, templates.
If it&#39;s like medical school, we want to hide the minimum for credentialing and then also high the minimum performance level.
And, uh, the type also can be removed so we can update this to type and credentialing and minimum performance level.
It can be removed if it&#39;s a medical school program for residency program and you don&#39;t have to, we don&#39;t have to hide those.
And remember in the company portal under programs, that&#39;s where you specify. If it&#39;s a residency program or medical school, same thing for nursing schools, we can hide 1, 2, 3 fields.
And then if you come down here, there&#39;s a section for adding custom questions. I want you to know you don&#39;t have any questions on the questions.
Okay. Now, if we go to this template and try to add a custom question, Add questions, select, Um, on this page, there&#39;s unselect, which has typo on it.
I should say they should not capitalize the S and then unselect. It allows you to delete Something without having any sort of alerts for it.
So we should add a sweet alert, asking the user to confirm that they want to delete a question from a template.
So that&#39;s all under case logs and editing the template. So I just reviewed, we have removing those three fields. If it&#39;s in medical school or nursing school, um, then fixing the type well for unselect and then adding a sweet alert.
And then lastly for managed diagnosis and managed procedures, when we add a category, Okay, that&#39;s actually working fine. So that was a bug before we fixed it.
So basically for templates, we want to address those items.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/51276a58fc7449fa8125f9c8434f196b</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medical Education Reports - Google Sheets</pre></td><td><pre>So for this, uh, three reports, first one is the site rotator report who will allow them to see your list of users that are scheduled to work at a specific site, so they can select one or more sites and then roles.
And it will allow them to see, um, what hour, hours or rotations that they worked at each site. So this is rotation or shift.
And if it&#39;s a shifter, it gives you total hours here. If it&#39;s a rotation, it&#39;ll just give you the start date and end date.
And so over a period of time, which students worked at which site, this particular report is actually missing a criteria here.
You&#39;re gonna be selecting an individual and the individual that&#39;s selected. It should be And that individual, during these date ranges work with all of these, uh, people.
And we should update this to actually have a name here instead of just saying username. So that way it looks more realistic.
So it&#39;s giving credit to people that have worked with students or residents during a date range. Then we have the site survey report.
This is any given time. You select a, and it&#39;ll tell you who&#39;s on, who&#39;s working and who&#39;s scheduled to either be there because of rotation or shift and by site.
And this is good for like emergency responses or something where you need to know who&#39;s working at a different, uh, uh, building and a, and especially if you need to return to them and just update it to have real, you know, some real names in here, you don&#39;t need to have this many items, but instead of saying first name, last name, put some real names in there and it&#39;ll make it more look more realistic.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f243bdf9531b40c2a4f7f62dceab11cd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, Mike. So I was testing something for Ross vet and I&#39;ve come across some problem with the usability here that can lead to loss of data.
So for example, I&#39;ve under sessions, this applies to sessions and course objectives under mapping. I can go and select a course, select the session, click load, and it&#39;ll bring up all the session objectives for that.
So what I could do here is quickly do all the mappings to what I want to do, and it works.
However, it&#39;s just as easy for someone to lose the data. So I can go in here, click X by mistake.
And I just lost all this mappings. And some of these may have lots and lots of mappings they made, and there&#39;s not even a confirmation for this.
It auto saves everything and that data is lost. So what we need to do here is make it a little bit more, um, add a little bit more of a process to change the, so there&#39;s not a human error.
So some, this is a something that I I&#39;m thinking that may work. So for example, if I have these objectives, um, if, if, um, instead of, well, instead of, um, having all of these items being editable at any given time, we could make it so that if there is at least one mapping for it&#39;s a session objective or course objective, and they, if there&#39;s at least at least one mapping in there and they click save, then it will become a list like this.
It would not be shown as an editable field. So adding a, um, a way for them to click edit if they want to click edit.
So if they want to edit an existing mapping, and then once that mapping is done, being able to click a save to make sure that is saved.
So this is just an extra layer of protection. And then, so that&#39;s one way to do it. Another way that we can do is make it editable like this.
And then if I come in here and instead of having the save button, we can just add a confirmation. If I click X, it will ask them to confirm they want to remove it.
And If, uh, and then we&#39;ll continue autosaving and if no objectives have been mapped, we have two options here. One is either show the field as editable because then they can just go in and start making changes and add them if it, or we can show an edit button so that they can click the edit and then start editing.
So a couple options here to consider. Um, but the key thing is we need to make sure that we protect the data that has already been mapped.
So they are not accidentally clicking X and removing things. And also showing it in a text view like this instead of a field, it&#39;s also easier for them to see and navigate it.
Um, rather than this, this field that can get very long.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4c45b129b819499b9237241d7d784f54</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>PINACLE® Express | PNC</pre></td><td><pre>And Mike. So, um, one of the things that came up during this Kevin call is that when we did the PDF for the eval, the header, we, for some reason we forgot, uh, the section four site.
So right now we have rotation at the top. And what we want to do is make sure to add the site slash rotation, and then under, and this section on the first roll, we can put the site name, then the rotation name, and then the dates as we have it here.
Um, this is on the assignments page when you&#39;re downloading a PDF. And when you&#39;re previewing then evaluation on that page by opening on a modal.
I don&#39;t think we show the site there either, so we can show the site there also. Um, this was part of that task that we did before.
So we may want to reference that one, uh, in this task since, uh, uh, it&#39;ll be easier for the developer to find that.
And then, um, the other page thing on the assignments page is they want it to have a way to, uh, like we have a bunch of filters at the top of that, um, rotations page.
And right now all of their, uh, evaluations are done on rotations and then, but they want to be able to see all the submissions that came in for a particular site as site may have several rotations that are linked to it.
And if they select a site, we would show list of all the, um, all the evaluations that are linked to rotations from that site.
Um, and on that table below where we, we just call it to the system real quick, It&#39;s under evaluations and assignment, and here basically adding a site field at the top and a list of all the active sites.
When you select a site, it&#39;ll filter all the rotations that are from that site. And we also need to show site somewhere here.
Um, so I think, uh, um, under the rotation name in italics, we can put the site name.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9a2d13df057446e0980a43099cc8c271</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>When you log in, you should see a couple of tabs. One is the admin tab, and then the other one is a personal tab.
So if you&#39;re logged in, um, make sure that you&#39;re toggled into the admin side. And then at the top, you&#39;re going to see the different programs listed.
Please confirm that you have access to all of the programs that programs that you need, uh, access to. And then from there you can toggle into any one of them and update the page to reflect that program.
And then from the, from the users page of that respective program, you&#39;ll be able to see all of the residents, faculty, and others that have been created in the system here.
You can make additional users, you can switch into the, uh, invite tab and invite anyone that hasn&#39;t been invited. Um, and then also on this page, if you need to change any demographic information, you can click on it to expand, edit the different edit demographics, or what have you profile to spew their profile.
Um, then on the left side, you have your evaluations and templates. So right now we are making a bunch of changes to these templates.
Uh, so please give us a, um, a little bit of time to finish cleaning that up. And as soon as it&#39;s done, you&#39;ll see the templates in there.
Um, so he skipped the evaluations part for now. Um, and then for schedules, want to just go into the system, set up rotations page, and here you can add any of the rotations that need to be added schedules page, allow you to create your block schedule.
So click here, new block schedule, and here you can put it in all the criteria for creating a block schedule.
Um, you can skip this optional sections and then, um, also you can just use when you&#39;re selecting people to include on the schedule, just use the appropriate roles, so you don&#39;t need to add them all individually.
Um, and then yeah, on your, um, um, once a schedule is created, there&#39;s a way to adjust the block, start and end dates.
You can also do that on this page once the schedule is created. Um, So, but the main thing that I wanted to highlight was The ability to switch between the personal portal and admin portal and for you to confirm that you have access to everything.
And then, uh, as soon as we&#39;re made all the evaluation templates, um, I&#39;ll be following up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/2d26fcc5596c46e7b8ebe5cac8def774</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Okay. So this is a bug that we have on the mappings page, and it applies to course objective mapping and session mapping.
This particular client does not use the curriculum mapping hierarchy. So they have in their system. I&#39;m sorry. Um, curriculum settings that they&#39;re not using the hierarchy.
So they&#39;re able to map from session objectives up to the program objectives or global objectives without using the course objectors, same thing from the course objectives.
So they have these tabs that show up, letting them pick out where they want to map it to. So if I select a course here and click a session and click load, I&#39;m able to bring up the session objectives.
And on the right side, I can pick which one I want to choose to map to what we need to change here is it shouldn&#39;t default to course objectives.
It should just be blank. And then they should pick which whichever one they want to, um, map to. And then once they do at least one mapping.
So let&#39;s say, if I do this one, then we lock it down and it stays on global objectives, which is correct.
But one of the things that&#39;s happening is if I click X here and clears everything, then it goes back to course objectives.
We should not do that. We should just keep them on whatever selection they made, unless they refresh the page. If they refresh the page, then we can just show blank and they can pick whichever one they want to map to.
And then if they come back to the page, after making at least one mapping, it will stay locked to whichever one, it was.
Well, we&#39;re going to be looking at at least one mapping and then showing the appropriate tab based on that if no mappings were made, uh, when they arrive on the page, we&#39;ll keep it as blank and then they can pick one.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c0f4ffdd563f4a739c7ac6667c69b437</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>How crypto enables economic freedom | by Brian Armstrong | Sep, 2021 | The Coinbase Blog</pre></td><td><pre>Hi guys. So I&#39;ve been thinking about this blog, um, and I wanted to talk about a few changes. Uh, and again, these are just ideas and I want to hear what everybody else thinks.
So first thing is the layout itself. So right now we have it. So it&#39;s these cars that appear and it goes, we have to go scan to the right and then go to the bottom and then scan to the right it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t flow.
Um, when you&#39;re trying to scan through the stories, because you&#39;re, most of the time you&#39;re going top to bottom. And if we look at medium, for example, I can go through and I can keep scrolling and look through these articles.
And it it&#39;s much more of a natural feeling top to bottom. And then when it comes to the, um, the images itself, it&#39;s when like the, the story itself is what the people will be interested in the title.
And, um, like when you have, when you have the images being the large thing that they see, I feel like it takes away from the story.
Um, and it, it, uh, it seems a little bit more like marketing or ad type appearance. So my first thought is we should emphasize the stories more by having the title be the more prominent thing.
And then the image can maybe on the right side and laid out like this top to bottom. Um, I think that that will flow better.
And then we can even borrow this tag section when we add the tags so that you can click on a tag and it&#39;ll show those on the right on the left side.
And then once you open up one of these posts, this whole top section where we ha they already know the title, they already seen the image.
So we&#39;re spending a lot of the screen, real estate on something they, uh, they don&#39;t need to see. And in order for them to get any value from this page, they&#39;ll have to scroll.
So we want to avoid that. So I&#39;m thinking this a little bit more and looking at a few of these blog articles in here.
So some of these articles, they do have an image at the top, and it does appear at the top. So in that, in that scenario, it would look similar to this.
Um, but we can still cut out the, um, um, I don&#39;t know. I still don&#39;t like the way that this particular article is where it&#39;s showing the image at the top, and it&#39;s not really adding anything.
Instead, there was one that I saw here. I like this thing where you actually have the article and the story is what&#39;s most important.
And then the image comes up at the top if they have an image. Um, and I feel like we can make the article in a way that you don&#39;t have to use a header image and we, um, we can make it so that they can insert the image anywhere in the article.
And it, we just take the first image on the post and use that as a header image. But what I really like here is you have the story and a subheading, which is the font hierarchy is really nice.
We can look at the font, the font sizes and use the same exact thing, same thing with the text here, the font size and the spacing between them.
I think it&#39;s usually like one and a half spacing between them. So it&#39;s easier to read, and I believe this, this, um, size font size actually 18.
I dunno. Well, we want to pick whatever is appropriate for our website, but the key things here is, um, the text is the center focus when you&#39;re looking at the article and the images are in there, but it&#39;s not, um, it&#39;s, it&#39;s easier for them to get into this and start reading.
And at the bottom, I also feel like if we use a horizontal approach where we&#39;re going to be able to prevent these things from being sized or like having alignment problems.
So if it&#39;s look, if it&#39;s a laid out in a left to right then we&#39;ll have more, um, but can use more space for tax and w it won&#39;t look so out of place.
So, anyway, so, um, just to summarize again, I&#39;m just talking through these ideas. The first thing is, um, do we want to consider laying this out in a top to bottom, uh, format and then, um, emphasize the text more with the image on the right side, then when you open it up, um, emphasize the S the story with the heading and maybe a subheading, and then the image.
If they, if we do have an image, it doesn&#39;t have to be the most prominent thing. Um, we can, we can, um, let them upload the image anywhere in the story and use the top image to be highlighted, um, on the list, view this way.
If someone wants to just talk, uh, focus on the text, that will be the first thing that, that user&#39;s seen.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/553c6b56cfd84143a934508b04134498</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Schedules – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So for this particular design, what I like is you&#39;re putting it on the dashboard and it&#39;s going to be helpful when someone&#39;s logging in.
Um, there are a few things we need to, uh, consider. This is a good location right at the top. Um, so if I was a resident, let&#39;s say John Smith, and I&#39;m looking at this page, um, there are rotations that I&#39;m part of which lasts two to four weeks and then their shifts that I&#39;m part of shifts, maybe a couple hours here and there.
Um, and then I also have, uh, may have, um, well, so the shifts are essentially hourly schedules saying that I work from certain hours to certain hour, which is, I believe what you&#39;re showing here.
Um, that&#39;s fine. The, uh, the one thing that I don&#39;t, I think, um, we need to keep in mind is If, um, we are looking at this, Uh, page, I&#39;m John Smith, I&#39;m looking at the schedule on the dashboard.
I don&#39;t really care too much on this page to see everybody&#39;s schedule. Um, it&#39;s better for if I need to do that.
I can go to the schedules page and we need to have a robust design there, but on this page, what I want to know is, uh, where I&#39;m working easily and, um, uh, each day, and then I like the idea of seeing who&#39;s, um, covering before and after me.
So, uh, in this case, I need to know the shift types. So for example, I think on the left side, we can have, um, two roles, essentially, one for the rotation that I&#39;m on and then list out, um, the anybody that I&#39;m working with.
Okay. So on Monday the 21st I may be on cardiology and then I have a senior resident and a attending that&#39;s working with me.
So there&#39;ll be three people on that team. And then, um, the next, uh, they may also be on cardiology and for cardiologist, since there&#39;s a rotation, he won&#39;t have the times at the top because when they don&#39;t enter times for cardiol, uh, for the rotations, but let&#39;s say on Wednesday, I&#39;m covering a clinic, uh, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
So in that, that will show up on the roll for sure shifts. And I would still show up as cardiology for the rotation role, with the same people.
But in addition to that, it&#39;ll say 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I&#39;m on a clinic. And in that same role, um, I can, we can show if I click on it, bring up a window and I can see who was on that particular shift that same day.
So that, that way I can know, or the same day or, um, uh, one before me and one after me so that I can know, um, who&#39;s who I&#39;m picking up from.
It may be helpful if I&#39;m designing a little bit while I&#39;m brainstorming. So let&#39;s say two rows. I think, I think it&#39;s also sufficient that we just wire frame for now, and that way we can iterate faster.
Um, so we have two rows. Okay. Yeah, actually let&#39;s make it clear rows one for my calendar events. Okay. Clicked on likes to divide.
And I couldn&#39;t say this is okay. I, uh, Cardell avoid using all caps mainly because I read in an article that it&#39;s, um, it makes it harder for people to scan and find the information, say again, we can say colleagues or others or something.
So it basically will be a link for me to click on, bring it up and see who on that. Um, and then let&#39;s say Wednesday, I&#39;m also going to be on card, but one of the colleagues had it scheduled page.
And so I left two colleagues. Okay. And the window that pops up, we want to show their photo, the name, role, and their contact information, including name, phone number, um, and email pager, and then also their primary program.
Yeah. All right. So we have carbs here and then let&#39;s say on Wednesday, Thursday, I changed from cardiology to FM.
This is all coming from the block schedule. And these will be coming from the shift, schedule this from the calendar.
So FM, and then maybe we can do something with this line to indicate that I changed. Um, and then we can also maybe do something with that particular role too.
So let&#39;s say the, okay, this is the day. Maybe we can maybe do something with the world to highlight that&#39;s what we are currently on.
So maybe use a different background color for this particular columns. So indicate today&#39;s Thursday. So anyway, so we have rotation and then we have shifts.
So this is going to model what you have already. So seven till 1, 7, 8, 2 on P here.
Uh, and then in this case, we also have, instead of colleagues, we can put the shift name, so it could be clinic the shift name, then they can click on it.
Cause we knew some information such as, that&#39;s what I mean with any notes site. Here&#39;s probably the qualities, same shift, a bunch of other stuff.
Um, when you click on this was on before me. All right. So then of that, and we can also cooperate time off, we can say, okay, so we can show it as the same beta.
So you&#39;re on a F M, but we can all relate on praying. I was just making crap up now, but design can be significant significantly games.
I&#39;m just trying to show the idea. So this will tell me that on this day, I&#39;m on this rotation, but I&#39;m off and then the calendar would be okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/1e4e6cd112c64f0cb93a5a2feb68830a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So we have a pretty significant usability issue here. So I&#39;m on the curriculum mapping page for Ross. And we can see here, I&#39;m under sessions, mappings and gone in there, selected a course, selected a session and click load to bring up the session.
And this is under winter server. So if you&#39;re testing it, just make sure that we&#39;re using winter. And if I want to map, I can go ahead and quickly do all the mapping, which is good.
However, it&#39;s just as easily lost. So if I can click, if I click X, I just removed everything and there&#39;s no confirmation.
There&#39;s no nothing it&#39;s auto saved. So if a faculty member accidentally clicks anywhere, they can instantly remove their curriculum objectives, which is extremely dangerous since these things should be, uh, maintained throughout the, uh, academic period.
So my thoughts here are instead of making this so directly editable like this, we could add a little, um, edit icon.
And when you click on the edit icon, this field with comes editable. So let&#39;s see. So if I have a new one here, If we can say something like, Like that, that indicates no objectives, haven&#39;t mapped and then put a little, Um, I think we only need like a little pencil icon here, a small edit icon And does it need to be a full button And doesn&#39;t need, I&#39;m just putting texts in that because I don&#39;t have the icon, but if you click edit, then this will come up.
And, um, after you make the changes, Actually we don&#39;t even need the save button. We can still continue to auto-save.
But if I click, if I go scroll down and click edit on the next one, the previous one should become an uneditable.
So for example, if I already have mappings here, Well, something like this, we can now The point instead of numbers.
And then if I want to edit, I have a little pencil icon. Do you, we can keep it at the top.
Right? And then if I click on it, it&#39;ll become editable. Um, like it was before. So to summarize, essentially making it safer for people.
So they don&#39;t accidentally do most stuff. So it&#39;ll instead of making, make, having the page always editable so they can click the X button.
We want to make it so that you had to click a, uh, small edit button in order to make changes.
And once you make the changes, we&#39;ll list those objectives out. And if you want to make a change, you click edit and we&#39;ll only have one of the objectives be editable at any given time.
So if I click add, um,</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d2532a905dda4ec88ae95759559bcc45</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Loom Recording 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>So this feature, essentially what we&#39;re trying to do is automate the creation of user groups. And right now you come in here, you create a group and add people to it one by one.
So what we need is a button here that says like auto-generate groups and it will either bring up, you&#39;ll bring up a new window or a new page, and that you&#39;re going to specify.
Um, I guess we can just use the, Okay. Just protect. Well, uh, one of the whiteboard where it&#39;d be kind of cool to project it on the whiteboard and actually draw.
Yeah. That&#39;s what I was about to get up to do that. I was like, that&#39;s all right. Um, well, you&#39;re going to have this here anyway, so, Okay.
I was going to say almost like overlay one, two. Oh, I see a Jackson. Just draw it on the image.
Pretty cool. That&#39;s pretty smart. Yeah. Yeah. So The, um, basically print auto-generate brings up a window and they&#39;re, they&#39;re going to have to be able to select group of people.
Well, you&#39;re going to be auto-generated groups for some purpose, such as a course. Let&#39;s say you have the anatomy course or for the autogeneration you&#39;re going to give it a name for the group, like some sort of starting name, so it could be anatomy And then you&#39;re gonna have to select, um, a group of people.
Okay. Which it can be roles, um, individuals basically like add like 10 individuals or whatever maybe, or other groups. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, and then once we have that, then we need to tell the system how it&#39;s going to do the naming of these new things, the naming convention.
Exactly. So it could be, um, suffixes that it adds like incremental one, two, three, four to the name. So it could be anatomy, one anatomy, two anatomy, three and so on.
So, all right. So naming convention, we need to give them a way to, uh, create, it could be, um, like a radio button that says a pen suffix, um, uh, like numbers.
I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just making this up numbers, um, or a pen letters. Um, and then basically that&#39;s like a simpler, simplest way to do it.
And if we want to, um, also use something you want to get more advanced with it, it&#39;d be like using something from the course itself.
So let&#39;s say we say this anatomy and we give them a dropdown to select a course. Yeah. And then you can use or something.
Yeah. It&#39;s if it&#39;s like the, uh, use the course, um, code and then UPenn, like the, uh, um, you know, that&#39;s going to get tricky.
Let&#39;s keep it simple. Right. So we can add that later. So, but like basically some sort of naming convention. Right.
And then using that to the pen, the name so that it&#39;s auto generating a bunch of, um, groups for it.
Okay. And we could, I think we could still add a way to, um, link these groups to a course because eventually you have to add it to a course anyway, but at least we do this one you&#39;re creating it.
You&#39;re automatically adding to the course also. Okay. Um, but that won&#39;t be used for auto, uh, naming. So like, okay.
And then maybe we could add some sort of setting at the bottom for setting section or something, Mike, uh, saying, uh, only create even number groups.
So like if there&#39;s one extra person, then they need to, like, the algorithm needs to do something to create even number of groups.
Okay. Will be even number of groups. Um, And this should be this, this should automatically randomize anywhere. Like when we make the list, it shouldn&#39;t just go with the alphabetical last name, first name and group.
It, it should be randomized first. Um, so we can add a setting that says that should be checked off or default by randomized students first, Um, or Alphabetically And last name.
So essentially either keep, put, put them in an order by last name and then group them or randomized first and then group them.
Okay. All right. We&#39;re sure this is season user groups. And so we will create, uh, an interface for this. And then you just have to worry about all the other things that are associated with it.
Such as let&#39;s say your pretend like your user. I go in there and I set it up and I create it.
What happens? What message do I get from it? What if I screw it up? How do I do what I just did?
So that means we probably need to add a way to batch delete like you a select all and select a bunch of groups and there&#39;ll be done because this may create like a hundred groups and we don&#39;t want to have them to manually delete one by one.
Right. Clicks on at the top check box, check, box bash, delete You started something here. So putting together. Yeah. How many, how many groups, uh, what are you doing?</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/70de3d21d49d4af7a29fd2c0a71e607f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) User (P) - NEW Create user</pre></td><td><pre>So this last permission that we&#39;re doing is for managing evaluations for sites and how this works is we turn this check box on and select some sites.
We will sure. The act assignments page on the personal portal. So evaluations assignments page have here on the left menu, clicking on the assignments.
We show all the assignments where the evaluations are linked to rotations that are linked to sites in the list of permissions.
So what that means is you&#39;ll see assigned evaluation assignments and then assignments will show every should. Well, it would only show rotation evaluations and Alicia rotation evaluations that are linked to sites.
We rotation. So rotation evaluation has a link to a bunch of rotations and those rotations have linked to sites and those sites must match the sites that are set up in the permission.
So that&#39;s up here should match the sites that are set up on this permission, and then they will assign it, appear on the assignments page.
And I&#39;ve also defined what to do about each of these fields. So for example, in the forms field, we should all receive show rotation evaluations, where we have a rotation set up in the assignment rule that are, that is linked to a site that is on the user&#39;s permission, same thing in the evaluate to evaluate T and the rotation dropdown on the assignments page.
We had to do the same thing where the form will only show forms that are rotation type and have rotations that linked to the sites that are on the permission.
Yeah. And then down here we have some additional specs that Rio had added.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4e3f28f5d23a4bb39c8b105fe5b4e887</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Sites &amp; Administrators – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>Hey guys for this PA this, uh, update, we&#39;re going to be adding a way to link sites to, to, uh, block schedules.
So if you look here, this is the creative block schedule page. That&#39;s on the schedules quick add new schedule. And this page where we create a block schedule, I have updated this design to have a panel here, which allows the administrators to be set just like we already have that feature.
But put, in addition to that, we have a way to link one or more sites to the schedule. So if you remember, sites are added in the institutional portal and what we&#39;re doing here is linking sites, um, to that particular block schedule.
So if by default all sites that are going to be included, but if they specify specific sites, then we&#39;ll only be including rotations.
So if you go to a rotation, you&#39;ll see that there are sites that are linked to our rotation. And if a block schedule has a site included, then we&#39;ll only be including that site&#39;s rotations in the schedule.
So assuming that the schedule has a site, if you open it up and you try to schedule it, you will only include any rotations that are part of that site.
Same thing in the rotations tab on the left side will only include anything that is linked to that particular site.
If you download the PDF, it&#39;ll include rotation that are linked to that site. Same thing in the simple view, both in the individuals tab, as well as the rotations tab, um, we&#39;ll link will only show rotations that are linked to that site.
And for the schedule administrators, this will work exactly the way that we already have scheduled administrators. The only difference here is the design is a little different where you actually select, um, you click this button and it&#39;ll add a row and where you can select a person and the person name is going to be Alyssa last name first and then roll.
And it will include only the active faculty residents, staff users for that program. And the functionality is going to be exactly the same as we have it now.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a9cfcf7c6d144e3ab83b2e7feb908b48</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) User (P) - NEW Create user</pre></td><td><pre>All right.

So let&#39;s go down to the section here. If this checkbox is turned on, then the multi-select will become active for selecting sites.
If the permission is turned on, at least one site is selected. The administrator will be able to see users page on the left side and groups with use people and groups tab.
And in this scenario, They&#39;ll be able to view, edit and delete users that are, have sites, those sites that are same sites as the home institution fields.
So if we have Andre, our example here, Andre Has home institution of metrics hospital. Then They will be able to view, edit and delete all users that have metrics hospital as the home institution.
They&#39;ll also be able to view edit of you all users that have assignments on the block schedule that have those sites activated.
So we, we have a way to link sites directly to the block schedule now. So if these are linked, then any user that has an assignment on this, um, will be, will show up on the users page, but this is only a view access.
And what I mean by view access to stay, won&#39;t be able to open up their, uh, their profile. I mean, the edit demographics page.
So you can go to the user&#39;s page and you can view the profile, but these three buttons will be missing.
And if you&#39;ve read the profile here, she will that in a follow-up task, we just, we can just show them here as on the users page and hide all of the buttons.
If it&#39;s viewer Veolia, then view and add users to groups that that has a link is a selected sites. So what that means is if we, in the backend, we have a way to link a group to a site.
And on the users page on the personal portal, this administrator will be able to see all groups that have a link to the sites that are set up on the permission, and they will all be, there&#39;ll be able to add and remove users from those groups, but they will not be able to edit the groups, academic period site name, or delete the group.
In addition to this, there&#39;ll be able to create edit and delete groups that have linked to that site.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ec9562353f694c89a8879e5272353ca3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Jenny, for this issue that you&#39;re having with the documents, we were able to, uh, identify the problem. And we&#39;re working on resolving that where you cannot select certain sites because the list is solely covering a part of the part of the alphabet.
And it&#39;s because the number of sites that our KP has is greater than what that field is, uh, uh, able to support right now.
But we are going to expand that to make sure everything is included. Um, I&#39;ll follow up with you when that is done.
So as far as the sites page, there was some updates that were added since the last time we spoke and it makes it a little bit easier to use.
Um, but the documents upload functionality here. It hasn&#39;t been added back yet. It is something that we&#39;ll be adding back and this page is now also visible to the program administrators.
So they&#39;re able to see everything that is going on with the site. So that&#39;s why this update was done in the meantime one, uh, for that updating any of the names that you have to do, you can go to the documents page, go to manage documents.
And here you have the ability to manage all of the documents for your, um, for your organization in one place.
Um, at the top, there is a way to filter by site and also a way to search here. And for any document that needs a name change, you can just click, expand and click the upload updated document.
And here, if you don&#39;t need to upload a new document, you can just rename it and it&#39;ll be saved and just had to refresh the page to see the change.
And the other thing to note here is, uh, you could, for any of the documents that out any of the sites that require a new document, you&#39;re able to upload those documents directly from this page without having to open up each site in each program, um, simply click on upload site document, or a book program document, and, um, do that all from here.
And again, we are going to fix this a site dropdown as soon as possible. Uh, probably sometime early next week.
That&#39;ll be, that&#39;ll be ready and I&#39;ll follow up with you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a5f797ee729d41b9846522975d794040</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;re going to go through the process of creating a new user. So I&#39;m going to create a new resident user.
So first thing we want to do is, um, go to the user&#39;s page, select your user, and we&#39;ll call this Greg house.
Okay. You already have a primary program. You fall good because I&#39;m in the internal medicine program. I&#39;m not going to add any secondary affiliations, and then I&#39;m going to put the password for now, because I want to log in as this user home institution, it&#39;s going to be metrics, hospital, select role PGY one activation date.
This is going to be the first day this user can log in. &lt;inaudible&gt; Okay. Greg has already has his email. Let&#39;s put this big house and we&#39;ll also pick, find a picture of grant house &lt;inaudible&gt;.
Okay, so now we&#39;ve got Greg housing here as a PGY one. Okay. Especially Alice. I have him as a faculty member, edit demographics.
We&#39;ll make up some data here. &lt;inaudible&gt; again. So this is a, This is something that we should probably improve so that if I&#39;m a us citizen, I shouldn&#39;t be entering visa information.
Uh, these fields should only appear if I choose, um, visa, and we can probably put that into another page and get rid of the citizenship status, but small thing that we can discuss later, additional info T-shirt size large.
All right. So we got Greg house created. The next thing we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;ll take a look at this profile.
Everything is filled out, Um, Institution. Okay. Now this looks like it&#39;s a Fix that later. Okay. So we have a bug here that we should fix.
Um, one is when I first create a user and fill out all the fields and come here, I already had an entry in the graduate medical education history.
Um, but I never added one. So that&#39;s a bug that is related to the fact that I added a home institution when I set up the account and that is creating an entry in here, but the users cannot do anything about it.
And we should not show that here until they come in here and add a new program. Um, so I can try recreating that and then, uh, get another user and show that in a video, how it appears here, and also show that if you delete it and you click add program, this dropdown will be empty.
So that&#39;s a bug. So when you deleted, uh, when you come to the page, it should be empty. And if we can not fix that problem, at the very least, we should fix the problem of when you delete the dummy entry and you click add program.
It should give you this dropdown for, to select another one because most users will not know that they need to refresh the page.
It&#39;s an easy fix for us to do. We can just force the page to refresh and everything will be fine.
So actually it&#39;s two bugs. One is the fact that we have a dummy entry. Two is the fact that we, when we delete it, it doesn&#39;t allow you to add a new program until you refresh it.
So the second bug is easy for us to solve. As soon as you delete the dummy entry and you click, uh, it should refresh the page and the ad program will work.
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and make some fake data here, Trying to see if we have a, Another thing that we can fix here is we show all of these degrees, but none of these are medic.
Most of these are not medical degrees. Um, we need to only show M D D O And MBBS. Those are the three, um, or we can end it and we can also leave no degree and other, so everything else should be removed.
So that&#39;s a separate task on its own. So I&#39;m adding, So what we&#39;re doing here is adding all this training history.
So there&#39;s a system keep track of all of this, um, for finance reimbursement. So I&#39;m going to say I added this medical school and I&#39;m going to add his, uh, internal medicine training program.
And this always will start July 1st. Um, because in the United States training programs always start July 1st. And I know that this is a tree three-year program.
You can see IRP cause three IRP means initial residency program. And that is the number of years of funding. The government has provided for this user.
So I&#39;ll be 21, 22 and three Set that up, save. And then now we need to add training details March 2nd To June 30th, &lt;inaudible&gt; Every year adding a training history user, um, graduated from medical school on March 1st 20, and I have to enter the gap.
So we have to always show what the user was, what the, uh, trainee was doing between graduation from medical school and his first year of residency.
So then we start adding the first year of residency. That&#39;s going to be July one, 2022, June 30th, 2021.
That&#39;s his first year of training. Second year going to be July one here, 22 there another one, three. Oh, there you go.

And if that&#39;s turned on when a, uh, evaluation is submitted, we will calculate a score for it. And, um, we can have two check boxes.
Actually one is four indicating that it is a graded evaluation. And the second check box to indicate that a evaluation, uh, response score is visible to the person that&#39;s submitting it.
So, um, first check box, this is a great evaluation. Second check box, uh, show score to the evaluator while form is being submitted.
And then from the personal portal, we want to show at the top or bottom a section that says, uh, uh, total possible points and then total earned points.
So as they, as they are completing the evaluation, um, we will keep track of how many points the person has earned.
So it&#39;d be like, um, if, if there&#39;s 20 Likert questions on there, each of them are true or false, and the values are zero on one and they answered 10 for as true.
Then we&#39;ll show a score of 10 out of 10 over 20. And, uh, when they submit it, it&#39;ll be something that&#39;s shows at the top.
As a section that says, this person has earned a 10 out of 20 points on this evaluation from the administrative side.
We also want to show it on the assignments page when you&#39;re viewing the most recent response, uh, uh, top what the score is.
We also want to show it on the PDF. Again, this is only showing up if the template is a graded evaluation and then on the reports for evaluation summary reports.
Um, if it&#39;s a, if they&#39;re choosing a graded evaluation, um, we would want to, um, show the score if they run the report, um, by individual evaluate tour or evaluate teas, uh, we would not show it if it&#39;s being grouped by role or other scores.
Actually, I take that back so we can, we can show it for, um, evaluator evaluatee as well as for the, um, um, role and user times, we just need to create a X one, uh, write an explanation and a mock-up on how that will be, uh, calculated.
So if it&#39;s been done by role, then we would take, um, the average for all of the individuals that are included in that role and show it as a, a, um, an average for all of the entire PGY one role PGY two role.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/883da3d96e1445218c06c7bdce3b8917</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>So for each of these tasks, I will just explain, um, what exactly we need to do here for this left one.

So want to review the, uh, IRP in a video cause it&#39;s a little tricky depending on the resident situation.
So if I go to this particular resident&#39;s profile, a few things can happen for a resident in a medical school.
When they graduate, when they&#39;re applying for residency, they could match into a categorical program, logistics such as internal medicine. And then in that case, they would have the IRP set for internal medicine Like that.
Um, but in your particular scenario, you&#39;re dealing with a preliminary resident. So if we have preliminary, um, medicine set here, if that resident only mashed into, sorry, um, I&#39;m going to save preliminary here, Preliminary medicine.
So if the resident only masked into preliminary and did not simultaneously matched to the advanced program, so in their fourth year of medicine, uh, medical school, they applied, they did not get into radiation oncology and only got into the KP preliminary program.
In that case, this is their resident, uh, IRP. It will be set to three years of funding that they receive.
But if the resident did match into the radiation oncology program at the same time as the preliminary medicine, then it would, uh, be set as IRP for the radiation oncology program.
So you, you would not set the IRP to be preliminary medicine because that would only give this person three years of funding.
If they Matched simultaneously to radiation oncology, they&#39;re going to get five years of funding from the government. Um, and the residents, since they can only have one IRP, it has to be one or the other.
So if they will mashed into preliminary medicine, that is the IRP. If they match simultaneously to the, um, advanced program, then the advanced program is the IRP.
There may be scenarios where they do the preliminary medicine and then they apply again and get into the advanced program.
In that scenario, the IRP still remains the preliminary medicine cause an IRP never change. So if they mashed into preliminary, preliminary did that program and then applied again and got into the advanced program that needs to be added as two separate entries.
So I would save this and then go in add program and then Radiation oncology for the dates for that. And I would not set this to be the initial residency period.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f012ad58d814477e846bdd6f67b43149</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) User (P) - NEW Create user</pre></td><td><pre>So this will be a pretty complex task. And I wanted to take some time to review how it&#39;s supposed to work.
We currently have one task that&#39;s happening, where we are adding a permissions page. Um, that&#39;s this particular task &lt;inaudible&gt;. So In order to do this, this new task, this task likely will need to be merged.
I want to just start from the top and explain how it&#39;s going to work. So we have three permissions being added.
So the way that this permissions page works is you select a user and then turn on different check boxes to give them permissions.
So for example, you have an account creation, one where you can select roles and then the administrator or a person that you select will be able to create users from their personal portal that match these, this role.
So assuming that Andrei has this turned on from their personal portal, they will see a user&#39;s page. And on that user&#39;s page, they&#39;ll be able to create a user and that user can only have roles that are defined here.
So they&#39;ll be only able to create administrator or users and the users that they create automatically linked to the same home institution and program as an Andrei.
So that&#39;s actually this one described here. So it create, you turn all the check box, select one or more roles.
And when the roles turned on and the setting is saved, the administrator be able to see the user&#39;s page on their personal portal, but it will not show the invite or groups tab.
When the users page, they&#39;ll be able to add a person button here. They will only see user types that match the roles that they have permission for.
So in this case, if they have administrators&#39; role, then they may see staff user type he listed here. And then if you click on the add person button, they&#39;ll be able to take them to this new user creation page.
And you&#39;ll see that we don&#39;t have primary program sec, uh, affiliations or home institution here that goes, that&#39;ll be automatically set to the same home institution and program as the user that&#39;s creating this account.
So that&#39;s the first permission. Then we have a permission for managing users.

So I was hoping that you can add the specs for this task. So this is a change that we are adding to these block schedules page.
So if you look at the URL, this is demo dot metrics, lab.com/administration/schedules. And then if you click create new schedule, click edit on the schedule, you&#39;ll get to this URL.
And that&#39;s why we want to include it in the specs. And what I&#39;m adding here is basically I&#39;m replacing this section in the middle with a card here for specified sites and administrators.
And on here on this, we&#39;re going to say, include the ability to specify sites for the schedule. And here we&#39;ll show a multi-select like this, that shows all of the sites, um, for that organization.
Then we&#39;ll say, schedule administrators. And, um, On the schedule administrator section. I can select an individual and then specify, um, whether they can assign a create, assign and created and deleted assignments for users with the following roles.
So for high, a talent, it&#39;ll only be selecting the medical student roles. And then so if the time comes in here and that chooses a site that is called the NYU, and then they select a, um, administrator here and say they can only modify the preceptor roles.
Um, then in that case, the preceptor will be able to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/36d190b4590e47a393077d97b18fca3f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>PDF Signature – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video review, the key words feature that we&#39;ve been planning to going from beginning to end using, um, the metrics, uh, features that we already have along with the designs that, Um, Mike Worked on.
So if I go into our documents section on the institutional portal, we have templates for creating, um, Attract, uh, tablets.
And in here we choose the programs and roles and so on. And what we need to add at the bottom here is a way to designate, um, signers.
So if we are creating a contract, you have different types of signers. There&#39;s going to be the person that receives the contract.
And there&#39;s also going to be the institutional leaders that need to countersign it. So the Dio and the program director and so on.
So if, um, we are creating a template on the institutional level, anybody that is always going to be signing that contract.
So if I&#39;m creating a contract for all the residents of internal medicine, and I want to be able to say Theresa, the Dio is going to be always signing it, then I&#39;ll add a section at the bottom, says, add signers.
And it will let them select one or more users that will be always signing it. And then, uh, we can also include a check box that lets the system know, um, whether or not the signers that are on the template will sign first or after the, um, other signers have signed.
So the reason I say that is because, um, we will have additional signers that are added by the program coordinators, uh, when the document is generated.
So we want to say, here&#39;s a check box. Here&#39;s a section that lets you designate multiple individuals who are always going to be signing this document.
And those individuals will sign before or after the additional signers have signed. Now we can take a look at the design here.
So once a document is generated, so this a model that we start off with on the design is on the program side.
So if I go to documents, templates, I&#39;m going to choose internal medicine here, generate con uh, document and send email.
So this model we already have, and what we&#39;re doing here is expanding it to have the ability to include signatures.
So we borrowed this design from DocuSign and you can say, here&#39;s a check box and I want to send a sequence of signatures and I can add one or more people here.
They can be either internal and they can select from a dropdown or external and they can enter an email address.
And then the second person, and you can keep adding more. Um, each per recipient will need to sign and sign within X days.
And then when I click send document, it will, um, send it to the first person. If the checkbox is turned on, if the checkbox is not to turn on, then it&#39;ll go to all of them at the same time.
Then here&#39;s what the email looks like. It will send them an email with the list of, um, people that are awaiting for signature and then they could click on it and sign it and it will go to the next person, the next person, it will show that the person has signed it and they can sign it.
And then so I, it continues until it was finally signed by everybody and it will go to the, uh, uh, designated administrator for them to review in the system.
Okay. Here&#39;s what this PDF Tron looks like. So we&#39;re not going to be, um, using the PDF Tron or tool to designate which, uh, section of the contract they need to sign.
Basically, we&#39;re just going to have the annotation tool and they will just go to that page where the signature, their name is listed and they can just go in there, create the signature and move that signature to that place.
So all we&#39;re doing is sending the PDF document and it will show up, um, in an email click on, it opens up in a new window, they click and add signature.
They sign it and move it to the right place. It needs to be on the document and save it. And that will finalize it.
Yeah. So a couple of other additions here on the page where documents are generated. Um, so on this page here, we have document generated here.
We&#39;re also going to be adding a sent for signature tag here. This allows the other coordinators that are using the system to know that this document was already sent for signature.
And we&#39;ll also see a table there that lists out the people that got the email and the due date and whether or not it&#39;s been signed.
And then if I go to the next tab, a page here documents, and then generated, I&#39;ll see the list of documents that were generated.
So we already have that feature. And what we&#39;re adding here is a column that says status and list out the people that have signed it.
And then once everybody has signed it, it becomes pending review and they&#39;ll have a review button and the coordinator can review it and approve it.
And then the contract is basically added to the trainees profile and we&#39;ll send out an email. So we talked about, um, how the contract is a template is created.
We can add permanent, like a set of individuals on there. That&#39;s always going to be signing then that from the coordinator side, they would go in there and add additional people to sign.
This could be the resident that receives a contract. The email gets sent out. It goes to people in a sequence or all at once.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f3ebff021749451b936d91aaea7ff597</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Anya.

So for, um, the, uh, design, I didn&#39;t get to finish it yesterday. I worked on it last night and then I just added some more things today.
So here are the notes that I had. So first thing is, um, for the month and year, we, we can make that a separate dropdown so that it&#39;s easy for somebody to switch to a past month.
Otherwise you have to keep clicking many times to get to the, uh, older entries, but if you make it, um, February as a separate drop-down and the year&#39;s separate drop-down, then we can do that.
Or, I mean, we may be able to just do that using like a widget it&#39;s a minor point, then there&#39;s the add the, um, we need to have a way to get back to Tibet quickly.
So if I&#39;m looking through past entries, I need to get back to today. We need to just have a button that says go to today or something like that.
Um, check to see what the calendars do. I think it&#39;s just a two day button use orange button to finalize the hours.
So actually that one is for this button at the top, to me, we want this white background and that it doesn&#39;t really stand out and this is a very important action.
So we need to make sure that it really stands out. And, uh, it&#39;s a primary, um, uh, action that you can take, um, to stand up more.
I mean, I guess one way to do it is we can have it lighter color or grayed out when there&#39;s nothing to finalize when, when there&#39;s something to finalize, it becomes orange and it&#39;s, uh, easy to see.
So you can look at the page for calendar and you&#39;ll see a button on the top, right. It says sync with my calendar.
It, we want to make it look like that. Then the legend part, we can get rid of that instead of that, we can actually put the label on the shift itself.
So I tried to, uh, make some, uh, a version here that you can model it, model it after. So a few things that have changed is one is having a S uh, a Stripe, a background stripes, so that we can see each role separately.
Like otherwise it&#39;s kind of all these hours of kind of just floating. Uh, and it&#39;s hard to know which goes with which a day, um, especially on a different screen sizes, but if you have a little background, uh, for every other role, then it&#39;s easy to see which shift goes with which day.
And then, um, and, and, and also just trying to, um, cut down on the number of, um, colors. Um, so for example, like we can have a different color for each shift type, but we don&#39;t need to have like a different color for each of the handles.
Uh, I&#39;m just using a four, four, four color for that. So it&#39;ll, it&#39;ll, uh, um, it&#39;ll be standardized and we can just use the color.
We&#39;ll just indicate the shift type. And then it&#39;ll, we can put the label on their day, indicate what shift they did.
Um, and then the start time and end time. The only thing that we&#39;ll have to factor in is if they just locked one hour, um, if the screen size is too small, um, we need to have an icon or something to represent, um, the shift, because you may not be able to have enough space to put the shift name.
Um, and then you have the start time and end time on here. I don&#39;t, I&#39;m also not sure if we can do the dragon drop easily because, um, some people will need to put like nine 15, nine 30, nine, 20, and it&#39;s going to be hard to, um, have that specific on a drag and drop interface.
Um, but for now, maybe we can do it as 15 minute increments and keep it at that. And then, um, and if they want to put something specific, they can just type it in.
Then here&#39;s the, I put a lock here to finalize it, and it&#39;ll just become gray once it&#39;s finalized And then down here.
So this, this is a field. Um, if you haven&#39;t logged any hours, then it&#39;ll show up like this. I can click, I was off and it&#39;ll just say off, and then you&#39;re done, or I can click log hours and then it&#39;ll turn into a field where I can type in my start and end time.
Or when I click copy from last shift, it&#39;ll copy from the previous day or the previously logged shift. &lt;inaudible&gt; Yeah. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m number six is basically this blank entry with buttons that allows them to enter it.
Um, and then for these arrows using a little darker color here And up here, I also added this panel, which is a standard panel that we use.
Um, and then they can click this button to automatically refill. And if that&#39;s turned on, when I click log hours, it&#39;ll automatically enter that, uh, prefilled hours.
And then I&#39;m still thinking about this right side, um, while it is a nice graphic here, technically they shouldn&#39;t have any violations, um, in their training program.
So there&#39;s not going to be a monthly violation list. Um, it should be something that&#39;s rare. So I&#39;m not sure if we need to have the graphic.
What I&#39;m thinking is maybe we just use this field, a section to show any hours that ha any violations that hasn&#39;t been justified.
And then basically we&#39;ll highlight it in a table. And then after they justify it, it&#39;ll just fall off there. And it goes to the violations tab, um, this way, whenever they&#39;re logging hours, they have quick access to anything that hasn&#39;t been justified.
So let me, let me think about that a little bit. I&#39;ll get back to you.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5df673fa789640bca260602c343ee6ce</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>University of Arizona - Tucson - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>So for this first question, we can explain how metrics is access through a single, a webpage that allows all users to get into the system.
And it is something that routes the appropriate users to the different portal based on the needs they have, uh, based on the, their role and functionality that they need.
So we can explain that there are four different types of, um, um, yeah, for different types of users in the system where residents of residents slash fellows, students, faculty, and staff.
And then there are also two level administration where you have institutional and program level administrators that have different functionality. And the common interface is what everybody uses to access the platform for the second one.
The best thing to do is, uh, explain that, um, &lt;inaudible&gt; We have, um, web based interface for managing all of the evaluations and 360 degree evaluations.
Um, all of the, um, milestones are preloaded into the system and for every special EV every ACG, I mean, specialty, um, and sub-specialty metrics have loaded the milestones and are ready to use, including the milestones 2.0 and the program directors and coordinators and GME office can view and access it.
And also for when you&#39;re creating evaluations, the evaluations can be linked to the different milestones and tracked work hour or duty hours.
Our module is built into the platform and allows residents to log hours and metrics checks for violations for all of the ACG rules.
And then other documentations, such as, uh, immunization records, uh, certifications, exam scores, all can be tracked and metrics with expiration dates and metrics sends out reminders for those expiration dates.
&lt;inaudible&gt;. So for this, uh, third one, We can go over the metrics has a requirements module that allows a onboarding of new residents and fellows.
Um, but even before that, we can explain how we have a module that is allows integration with Eros. So that metrics pulls in any new residents directly into the platform.
So the, and the profiles are automatically created with their demographic information. And once the residents are in the platform, the onboarding module or requirements module, it can be used to collect important information and paperwork that needs to be collected from them, such as immunization records and certifications.
And there is also a doc documents module that can be used to generate contracts for these residents and fellows once they&#39;re in the platform.
So, and then we can also include a screenshots of the, uh, era, well, not ERs for the, uh, requirements module, the status board, as well as for, um, our screenshot for the, Um, Contracts module, which we can, I can help make later.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3c5d125585ab4db2b1a011de1cc2d668</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>University of Arizona - Tucson - Google Docs</pre></td><td><pre>So for creation of the block schedule daily and on-call schedule, we can have, um, two sections. One is for block scheduling and one is for, um, daily clinic slash on-call scheduling.
And then for the block scheduling, let&#39;s include a screenshot of one of the block schedules, which has all of the, uh, a bunch of the residents scheduled.
And then it can explain that metrics allows the creation of a block template with custom dates. And then for each of those dates, uh, schedules can be added for the residents, fellows, faculty members as needed.
And this information can also be, uh, uh, updated by different individuals that needs to have permissions for it, uh, such as a chief resident and program administrators, um, that that will maintain the schedule.
Okay. And for the, um, shift and on-call scheduling, well, we need to explain and show a screenshot of the, of a shift schedule with a bunch of dates on it.
And there, we will explain how metrics supports the creation of different multiple shift schedules. And this, each of those shifts can be used in different ways, such as one shift can be created for the clinic.
Another one can be created for on-call and metrics. We&#39;ll combine all of these schedules for the resident and presented to them in one calendar.
And this is something that allows the residents to manage their schedules in one centralized place, and also have a way to sync it with their personal devices outside of metrics, such as their iPhones or Google calendar &lt;inaudible&gt;.
And For the block schedule section, we can also explain that the schedules and con, uh, curriculum and content is also distributed automatically by the system, uh, via email, so that the, uh, the individuals that are scheduled to that we&#39;ll get an email with all of their content, uh, before they are supposed to start that rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f19331e99df543a69f61094275d61207</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>St James SOM - Curriculum Import Template - Google Sheets</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the new curriculum import template to keep it simple and avoid having to create multiple CSV files that are disconnected.
We consolidated those files into one document and simplified the, uh, the, uh, data so that it&#39;s easier for all the faculty to enter the information that&#39;s needed to import.
Once these documents are set up, you can send it over to us and our team will, um, uh, import that information into metrics.
So here is the, uh, template that you can use to build the content. So it starts off with the course in rotation, uh, sheet here.
Um, so when now, whenever a, a faculty members working on this, the first thing to you can do is just download a copy of this, um, or copy it to your own Google account, uh, so that you can work on it.
This, this page itself, uh, will not be editable so that it doesn&#39;t, uh, um, so multiple faculty members have access to this.
So this is just sample data w entered here. You can always just download a copy and then delete that sample content and to your own course information.
So the first page, uh, sheet here, we have some courses and rotations. This allows the, the curriculum, uh, faculty to enter any of the courses or rotations that they oversee.
So this information will translate into metrics under the courses and rotations page. So will, when this is important, it&#39;ll create all the courses and rotations in here, along with all of the details that are defined, The Orange columns are the ones that are required.
And the, uh, uh, and, and if you don&#39;t have information that fits into this or these orange columns, um, this is something that can be discussed internally with your curriculum Dean, who may be able to provide that for rotations that have more than one start date, you can simply enter the, a sample, start a mandate.
So if it&#39;s a six week rotation, enter the sample start date for a start date and end date for one of the six week rotations for sessions, which are events that happen within a course, these are the, um, fields that we need to have for creating the data and metrics.
So there&#39;s a lot in here, but most of them are not required. You can simply enter the name, the code, the, the course that it belongs to.
So we can see here, it says course slash rotation code, so that shouldn&#39;t match this course of the rotation code.
That&#39;s defined in the first tab. And then for keywords always use a semi-colon to separate the keywords so that it&#39;s easy for the system to separate that in importing it, and then for schedules, um, it can add details in here if you have it, if not, this can be added separately in the future.
Um, one more thing to note here, session type, um, there are some session types that are preloaded into the system, but if you&#39;re overseeing a session that, uh, does not fall into one of these, you can always add them and then we&#39;ll create those when we&#39;re doing the import.
Huh? So after S sessions are created, then you have session content session, content falls under three categories, instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources.
So metrics, um, comes preloaded with the AMCs, uh, List of instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources. So for if you&#39;re using one of these, you can always just refer to the code in front of each of these, uh, methods and enter that into the, uh, uh, method type column, and then put the title and description.
And so on. It also is important to, um, define the session code. So this code will tell the system that the content belongs to this particular session, so that coach should match the session, uh, code that&#39;s on the first half, sorry, second tab.
So session code is here. And if you also have any sort of attachments that go with this, this is something that will need to be added into the system later.
This is just, uh, in this file, we&#39;re just defining the, uh, uh, content type and attachments will be added later.
So now that we went over the course rotations sessions and session content, we&#39;ll just review how that looks like and metrics once it&#39;s important.
So the courses added to the courses and rotations, and then sessions are added to the sessions page. So if I select this course here, then I&#39;ll see all those sessions that were imported, which the session type session title, and so on by expand it, then I&#39;ll see the content also.
So instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources. So that&#39;s how it will look once. This is, uh, the file is imported into metrics.
Next this take a look at objectives. So the objectives and metrics fall into the following categories. There is global objectives, which are national standards, such as, such as the AMCs PCRs, or Ken meds or Caribbean, um, uh, um, uh, objectives from the accreditation body.
So these objectives already preloaded into metrics. So you don&#39;t have to worry about entering that in, into this file. So the next, uh, what needs to be added in here are the course objectives, program objectives, and session objectives.
So the program objectives may already been added also. So if a core course faculty, you can start at the course objectives level and then enter the course code that you&#39;re working on.
This course code should match the code. That&#39;s on the first con first tab, and then each of the objectives are broken down into categories.
So a category can have one or more objective in it. So I had to define a category code, which should be a unique identifier along with the category name.
And then for each objective within that category, you can define a code and the objective name. So if we go into metrics, go to the course and rotations page, and then go to the objective tab.
I select an objective here. I&#39;m sorry. I still have the course here. You can see that this is the category code.
This is the category name, and then objective code objective name. So that&#39;s how metrics will import this information into the system.
So for all of the courses, please add the course objectives and the which category they belong to. If we don&#39;t have a category, you can simply just create a dummy category with the course code as a unique code and name to represent that course then down to the session level, which of the, which of the individual lectures and labs and other things that happen within a course, just like in the course objective page, we have to define the, uh, the code of the session that the objective belongs to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/9f8bbc7b0d53409f8e5c6ffdd2e7524f</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Adtalem Dev Discussions</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So I wanted to review some of these things that you can help design. So for the ability to create an schedule with preceptors, let&#39;s go to metrics under schedules.
We have the block schedules here, and what we need to do is give people the ability to make some changes when they&#39;re setting up these schedules.
So when I create one, I want to add a section here. I probably think it&#39;s better to put it as like a panel and that panel we can have or card, whatever we call it now, and that card we&#39;re going to call this like, um, um, Sites and administrators.
And in there, we&#39;ll be able to specify which site that this schedule applies to. So we&#39;ll have a site option there and that drop down and that should be optional.
And then we also will have a way to specify, specify individuals as administrators and for each administrator. Um, we&#39;ll have a setting that has two check boxes.
One will say this administrator, um, can modify, uh, anything on the schedule. And then other one will say, this administrator can fully Mon a pulley add and add, uh, assignments to the schedule.
Um, add an edit assignments to the schedule, um, but cannot modify existing schedule assignments. So Essentially, well you do say, take a screenshot of this, put it in there, but a white box over this section and then create a new panel there.
And they&#39;ll have two sections, one for selecting a site, another one for selecting a site administrator. And you can copy one of the designs that I did the other day So you can see here, I had the rotation directors and administrators, um, and where they&#39;re selecting the individual and they had two permissions for you for each person.
So same thing here, the only difference is you&#39;re going to be adding one more section about this, to select this site.
So the panels to be called sites and administrators it&#39;ll have a way to select a site. And then underneath that, they&#39;ll be able to add multiple with permission.
Um, On what they can do. And we should also limit the dropdown to only show individuals that are, um, that have a user type faculty or staff So the resident faculty or staff, but no students so that we don&#39;t accidentally set a student as an administrator.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/5337ac22cb784388941237c807ee52d9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Helen. I was looking at, uh, Vivian&#39;s account and I noticed she has this NPI number. And then, uh, we were also looking at the other resident Tiani his account, and it looks like she&#39;s also showing the same NPI number because in the demographic section, they both have the same ID number entered.
So here NPI number for Tiani and for Vivian it&#39;s, it looks like a typo on one of them. Um, so once that&#39;s updated, it will update on the about us page.
So a about page. So I also want to just provide a little bit of an explanation for the documents and certifications page.
So this page was created, um, for tracking different documents and also send out expiration notification. So anything that has a document and, or have an expiration date can be added here, so that metrics will send out reminders when something&#39;s expiring or certain things that has a document and an ID number you can enter here, but also enter into the demographics field here so that once it&#39;s entered into this section, it will appear on the, uh, on the about page.
So demographics fields appear here as, uh, uh, ID numbers and the documents that certifications page allows you to upload the documents and then set expiration dates for renewals.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/58ebc0c0755a4a568ceeb7faa4b185a4</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>St. James - School of Medicine - Google Sheets</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at this import file that we have created for you and review how to use it.
So rather than using the previously sent CSV files, which are separate individual CSV files that are not connected together, uh, we have tried to standardize a little bit more and consolidated into these, uh, separate tabs on this one Excel file.
So hopefully it&#39;ll be easier for the faculty to enter this information. So we&#39;ll start on the first tab here. Courses in rotations allow, um, the entry of all the courses and rotations that are offered through the program.
And if you read through this, it&#39;ll also provide some explanations on how to use each, each L column along with sample data.
And the orange columns are the ones that are required for the import. Others can be left blank if we don&#39;t have the information.
So when you, when we import this file, this turns into courses in rotation and metrics, which all which has all the titles, the descriptions, and all of that, that will be pulled in from this Excel file.
Then under each course, we have sessions, sessions are specific to each course, and it has a, it represents each of the events that happen within a course.
So for example, if we have an P one Oh one is the course, so course code has to match the course that is on the first tab.
And then if for the session code, if this is the first lecture and, and P one-on-one, so we can, we can, um, use the use that course name and quote, I&#39;m sorry, of course, code to create a unique coding structure.
So a and P one-on-one dot lec.one Oh one. This would indicate to me that this is the first lecture in a and P one Oh one.
And after that, you can just fill in the information that you have about the course, including things like key session type.
And then we can import that into metrics. If we don&#39;t have some things like what session type to put this, then this is something that needs to be discussed with your curriculum lead at your institution.
Um, or you can reach out to us to see if we can provide a list of session types. Then we have session content.
So session content includes instructional methods, assessment, Raptors, um, for each session. So if I go to sessions and I select a course, so then down here for each session, I can show the details and we have content here allowing me to add instructional methods of assessment methods and resources.
So here you&#39;re going to Def define the method types. So we have the AMCs, um, I&#39;m at the time&#39;s already preloaded.
So if you click on this link, it&#39;ll take you to this page where you can see, uh, the different, um, codes and what for each type of a method.
And that can be entered into this method type along with the title and content and so on. If a particular session has more than one, um, method type, then you can create multiple roles for that.
So if PP PDP V zero one, um, has more than one, um, instructional methods, I can have multiple entries for that same, same session.
And when we import this, this will create the session content for each session that is created that added to the spreadsheet.
By the way, when you click on this link, if for some reason you&#39;re not able to view this page, just make sure that the URL ends with PDF.
And sometimes an extra period may get added at the end. You could delete that it will get you to this page.
So that takes care of the course content and the course structure. Then we get into the objectives. So at the highest level is the, is a program objectives.
This is the objectives for the school. Um, I believe we have already imported this. So this is just sample content that you can, uh, review and, uh, see what it looks like.
Um, but for the courses, that&#39;s where you, uh, the faculty will need to start working on, um, for each course, uh, there can be multiple, uh, roles entered for the, uh, the objectives for that.
So a and P one Oh one, for example, in this example, we only have one objective, um, but typically you&#39;ll actually have More than one, um, objective per Okay.
Uh, per course, and then, um, this includes the category as well as the objectives within it. So let&#39;s take a look at what it looks like and metrics to understand what those categories are.
So if I go to program objectives and metrics, you&#39;ll have a category here, category code, and then category, uh, sorry, objective and objective code.
So everything in metrics is, uh, every objective is grouped into a category and then the category and the objective have codes associated with it.
They should be unique identifiers for that particular objective. So that&#39;s what this, um, category code is. And then the, uh, category name is, and then down on the right side, you had the objective code and the objective description.
So you don&#39;t have to worry about the course category description, which is an extra field that we offer. If you want to add more details about that category.
Um, uh, typically you can just get away with using the course category code of course, category name, and then the objective code and the objective description.
And if you don&#39;t have it categorized into separate categories, just simply create one category and put all your objectives for that course into it.
Then down to the session, objective level, we have the session category and the session objectives. &lt;inaudible&gt; Same thing here. If I go to the sessions page, go to the objective, We have, um, the objective, the objective category code here, and then the category name, the objective code, an objective description.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/41be3a107e31416bbc38c03975837e46</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at metrics, curriculum, and review the import format. So right now, in metrics, we have the curriculum module, which everybody should have access to.
And when you log in there, you&#39;ll see global objectives, program objectives, courses, rotations, sessions, and search. So, um, these are the different parts of the curriculum hierarchy.
And then there&#39;s also the setup page, which allows the institution to customize the settings. So here is where the academic levels are specified.
So, um, so it can be &lt;inaudible&gt; is the first level. I must to second level, I miss three&#39;s third level and so on.
And then there&#39;s also the academic periods here. And for event types, there are different types of events that are created in metrics.
And these are standardized for the different sessions that you may have. There&#39;s also the session settings, which includes instructional methods, assessment methods, resources, and themes.
So we normally upload the AMC&#39;s instructional methods, assessment methods, and resources, and themes can be customized for each school. And this can be created on this page, um, by adding an ID and unique ID, and then the method name, same thing with the theme, you can have a unique ID for each of them and then include a theme for it.
So now let&#39;s take a look at the import file. So in order to make it easy for a school to import the data into metrics, we have, um, updated our, uh, CSV files.
So rather than having multiple CSV files that have to be pieced together, we have in this new format that each of the faculty members can use to fill in their information and then send it to metrics, uh, support team.
And we will, um, import that data for you. So this includes your courses and rotations. So you can see here, it gives you the course in rotation name, the type which can be their course or rotation.
And then the course code. This is a unique identifier for each course. It can be created and anything that is in orange is required.
So if you have, uh, uh, credits for that, and you can document that here, uh, for the start date and end date, please use this date format.
If your, uh, course does not have a start date and end date, for example, if it&#39;s a rotation, then you can leave that blank.
Or actually, uh, even better would be if you can put a sample, a start date and end date. So for example, if it&#39;s a rotation that&#39;s six weeks long, you can just enter a six week duration or for when the first rotation will take place.
Then the academic level and description that&#39;s, uh, uh, provide some more details the course, and then the user groups, if you need to update user groups, but typically this can be left blank, and then we can add that later.
So once you have the courses in rotation for each course, we need to document the sessions. So sessions have a session code session name, um, and these codes can be created, um, easily by using a standardized structure.
So you would, you can use the name of the course as a prefix. So for example, if it&#39;s, um, anatomy one Oh one is the course, then the first lecture in that could be a N T.
So rename this as an example, a N T a L E C dot Oh one. So that may indicate the first lecture in anatomy.
And then this would be the session name. These are just sample content that we just added, um, the course code.
So this course code has to match up the course code that is in the first tab. So ANP one Oh one would match up and P one Oh one.
This indicates that this belongs to this particular course, um, the session type, this should match up whichever session types that we have in metrics.
But if you&#39;re not, if you&#39;re not aware of what that is, you can enter, what do you think it will be?
And then we can review it. And then the, uh, theme, which are, there&#39;s an explanation up here. Well, how to use themes, uh, the duration, which is in minutes, keywords, start time, end time, and dates and sessions.
So these other optional fields can be filled in if you have the information and we can take a look at how that maps into metrics when it&#39;s important.
So if I go to our courses and rotations page, when the courses and rotations document is imported into metrics, it will turn into this one of these entries, which has the academic level, the type, the course code, um, the course name, description, and so on.
Then four sessions. We have same thing here. You have the session name, session type, uh, the title. So set it that we, the session code session, title duration theme event type and description.
Then if I open one of these, we&#39;ll have the, uh, schedule leaders. And so, uh, keywords, instructional methods, assessment methods, and key, and the resources.
So the content side of the session is actually added on a separate tab. So we have session content, which includes a session code.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8de54fa7a7c149a3a90b81b5c9cc2e79</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(9+) Backlog | !Design</pre></td><td><pre>I Mike, for this particular task, we need to update those email designs and they already have a general framework already done.
So what we need to do now is focused on each evaluation separately and update it. So for example, this was for the, um, summary emails that go out that we go out on a Monday and tells the residents all the pending tasks that they have to do.
Um, right now it&#39;s only showing evaluations because there&#39;s one evaluation that needs to be done. But this email does have other sections that show up.
If there&#39;s tasks to complete, such as any requirements they need to complete. So the best way to, uh, maybe generate this is to go to the, um, um, demo server.
Okay. The admin, And there&#39;s a place called sandbox here. I can run the summaries. So I go to residents and Ron, and then if I go to my Inbox here, I start to get emails here.
So this is the debug email address I&#39;m logged into. And then as when I run that script, I start to get emails.
So you can see here, we have emails coming to me and if sometimes I&#39;ll have one evaluations to complete, sometimes I&#39;ll have more.
You want to look at a template like this one where it shows you more than one, and then you can see here.
This is, um, G in indicates the resident, sorry. Um, the general form type. So if I go to templates and I have different form types, this is a G for general, um, are for resident, sorry, are for rotation, whereas evaluate in the rotation.
So, but these letters are not very intuitive and nobody knows what they mean. So one of the first things that we need to do is, uh, do something differently, maybe, um, uh, for G we can, instead of G we can say, um, the word survey underneath it, cause it&#39;s a general survey and for role are, you can put like rotation.
So it&#39;s clear that this is what we are showing when these show these letters. If they have a photo, then it doesn&#39;t really matter because we are showing the photo and then next to each of these, we sh we can, we can see that.
Um, if it&#39;s a general survey, we&#39;re not evaluating anybody else, we&#39;re just completing a survey. So it says survey there.
Um, and then it shows that the form name. So rather than showing it survey up, we want to, um, have, uh, attack like some sort of label, like just like we have status and due date.
We can have something for form name and then give the name of the form. And then if it&#39;s a rotation evaluation, then you can see here.
This is telling the resident that they&#39;re evaluating this rotation. So, um, we can put the form name first. So, so it&#39;s like a form name and then having a, um, text underneath it that says evaluating, and then it can show the, uh, rotation name, um, for this particular one, um, Lisa Cuddy, where you&#39;re evaluating somebody else.
We don&#39;t even show them the form name here. So we want to fix that by showing the form name, then it can say evaluating and show the person&#39;s name and there&#39;s additional information that&#39;s shown there.
So these are different types of, um, evaluation assignments that is all getting sent to this one person because they have to complete all of it.
So we want to standardize the design to have couple of things. One is making sure there&#39;s a label that indicates what that, what we are showing here.
And second is putting the, um, uh, the form name first, uh, putting what they&#39;re evaluating second with the label of evaluating.
And then, um, the, um, updating the letters that we show here, maybe with some label underneath the chose has rotation or in general survey.
Um, so that it&#39;s not just a big letter that they&#39;re confused by. And the other thing that I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m also considering is instead of seeing it in two separate columns, um, we could also explore a design where this is a full width and we have color like a table.
So it&#39;s a table being shown in here instead of these little cards. Um, that&#39;s some of those something to also try out, let me see if there&#39;s anything else in here.
If you open it up, there&#39;s lots of stuff in there. And then at the bottom, it says you have outstanding assignments.
This email shows you 25 of the most recent assignments, they&#39;re total X number. This one needs to overdue. So this is a really good thing that we do where we can, we limit the number of things that are shown there.
So instead of putting this at the bottom, we should put this at the top, so that it&#39;s clear that they have a lot of things that are missing and then you have pending requirements.
Um, that&#39;s also something that, um, uh, you may see a list of those. So here we want to show the requirement name requirement, which we are currently not showing and the due date.
Um, so that&#39;s something that we want to add upcoming events. So just like we have, so I don&#39;t know this, this, this particular part needs sort of design update, and then the login button should be at the bottom so that they can log into this as somewhat.
They need to, we can also &lt;inaudible&gt; Um, let&#39;s add some more text here. Hello, Alec. Um, um, here is a summary of all of the tasks that you have to complete in metrics.
Um, uh, uh, uh, some of these items you can, uh, you can click on the, uh, task to go into metrics to complete it.
And that way it&#39;s, it&#39;s clear that what they need to do. All right. So we looked at one, this is the, probably the more complicated email template, because it is different types of content in there.
Um, but if we go back to metrics, There&#39;s also many other ones you can find in here. So for example, this one says, um, first name, so we can say, hi, resident has a reminder to let you know that you haven&#39;t logged hours and metrics yet.
Please log into metric as soon as possible, your program is required to collect information, to maintain accreditation. So there&#39;s a typo here.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/559bf892e21c4f19bf536866ea7f8072</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kaiser Permanente Northern California - Recapped</pre></td><td><pre>Hello, KP team, and wanted to give a brief introduction to the recap page for KPMC. So, as we discussed yesterday, this is a, they afford that we&#39;re creating for each of our clients so that we can manage institutional goals and some of the major projects that we&#39;re working on.
So this is a shared space between our team and the KP team. And based on our discussion yesterday, I wrote out some of the, uh, the goals of identified and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a somewhat additional ones here based on our future discussions, especially once we have a discussion with Theresa also for the next call.
So these are some of the specific projects that we have identified from the meeting yesterday. And as we complete them, we&#39;ll be updating the status here.
And then on our quarterly meetings, we can review overall goals and how we&#39;re doing on those and anything that is under the KP tasks.
Um, as they are completed, you can Mark them off as done if they&#39;re assigned to a specific individual And for any sort of comments that need to be posted here, there&#39;s a little comment button.
And if you click on that a little louder to provide comments and sends us an email notification. So please take a look and let me know if you have any feedback or if anything needs to be modified.
And then we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll, um, use this as a centralized place for managing overall goals for institution. Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/14bfb0ecba5c498c9af2b2a53168a00e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Michelle. So just digging into this problem a little bit further. Um, first thing that I want to go over is the email types that we have here.
There are a couple of important ones for evaluations. One is the new evaluation assigned and the other one is a task summary.
So the tax summary one is this the one that goes out every Monday. So it summarizes everything that they need to do in one email.
And it&#39;s sent out on a weekly basis. In addition to that, there is an new evaluation assigned email that goes out as soon as an evaluation is assigned.
So on the 23rd, if there was an evaluation that was assigned, it could be sent out right away. And it looks like it was going out and on a consistent basis here for a while, until February.
And for some reason, if I look at their settings, that setting, sorry, um, OB GYN, San Francisco, that setting is turned off.
So this setting, when it&#39;s turned on, it will email out to the, um, evaluator and link to complete that form as soon as it&#39;s signed.
And if they do not complete it, then that assignment will get included in the weekly summary emails that goes on on Monday.
So all Gavin does a needs to do, or Patricia needs to do is turn this on and it should go out.
And, uh, it&#39;s, I&#39;m not going to turn it on for them. It&#39;s best for, um, uh, someone to, uh, Trisha to go in there and update it.
I&#39;m not sure who turned this off, but it&#39;s a good idea for her to go in and turn it on and also review some of these other settings for emails and notifications to make sure it is as it should be.
Um, including this one down here for expiration notification, uh, to make sure that she is added as a, a person that should be notified when a document is expiring.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/760382ed04b44986b172226d4f54c102</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So here&#39;s a design project that you can knock out. It&#39;s sort of a bug here. If you look at a user, we have the ability to deactivate their profile.
So which gets them off this list. Well, if they don&#39;t have any data, that&#39;s active, some of them choose this user that&#39;s not sold.
So I&#39;d say if a user has some data, then they can be deactivated. Um, if you deactivate the user, then they will, they don&#39;t disappear from the list until you refresh it.
So that&#39;s a bug one we can fix. So first part of that bug is when you deactivate somebody, they should disappear from the list and you can always access them by looking at the inactive page.
But the other problem is even if you deactivate a user in the program and go to the institutional portal, then in the users page, all of those users will still be listed here.
And there&#39;s no way to tell which users are truly inactive. So the way that metrics is supposed to work Technical difficulties here, John Ryan with surgery.
Okay? So let&#39;s pretend like this is the user and these are the programs. And he can be, if this person can be affiliated Secondary oppression, If a user has at least one primary one, one affiliation, then that person is considered active.
We have a status on the thing is active. If at least one of these is active. So if both of these are inactive, we automatically change the user one to inactive.
But the issue is that even if you inactive, inactivate, both of these programs in the institutional portal, there&#39;s no way to tell if a user is completely inactive.
So what we need to do is create a design for the institutional portal, where on the users page, it tells you which users are inactive by having a, um, flag for inactive.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/51300c8244864cc1b2d216fc33138cc7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>23 April, 2021 - Loom Recording</pre></td><td><pre>I did a slight rewrite of this email and everything you have in there. The only change that I made was just formatting it slightly differently.
Do you have a.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/fa898a99437445e29cd7a57798bca8d0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Objective Mapping – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at this new feature for a ton of them. So it starts off by adding a setting in the curriculum and set up page.
So that&#39;s under administration slash curriculum. We&#39;ll add an option to the right side where it will list out the academic periods and we will be able to select whether it will enforce the hierarchy of the data.
And it has an explanation at the top. And by default, it should say enforce hierarchy. And then if it&#39;s not, um, If, but if they can change it to do not enforce hierarchy for a specific academic period, and this should only be editable, if no mapping has occurred, if mapping has occurred for at least one objective in this academic period, they should be locked and should not be editable.
So If a program chooses to not enforce the hierarchy, then what happens is under courses in rotation, in the mappings tab.
So that&#39;s under courses in rotation, in a mapping tab, We will have the, so this should be selective course. And then if you select a course or rotation on the left side, it will bring that up.
And then on the right side, we&#39;ll have the option to map to global objectives or program objectives. So basically allowing you to map directly to the global objectives because Normal interface Allows only mapping from course objectives to the program objectives.
But if the Senate thing says, do not enforce a hierarchy, they&#39;ll be able to map from course objectives, all left to the global objectives and bypassing the program objectives.
And as long as one mapping is done, we&#39;ll lock it so that they cannot change how they map. So I choose program global objectives, I drag and drop to the right side, and now global objectives will be locked.
I will not be able to switch to programming Objectives On the session level, which is under sessions and mappings. On the left side, you&#39;ll be able to select a session and this dropdown should look like this, where we are showing the courses.
And then each session underneath that this is a screenshot from the assignments page on the evaluations left menu item. And if you open one up, it&#39;ll show you us a list of items under that category.
So in this particular case, it will be grouped by the course code and course name. And then for each course you&#39;ll list out the sessions for that course.
So if they pull up a particular session and on the right side, you&#39;ll have the option to drop a drag and drop to the course objectives, program objectives, or global objectives.
Key thing here is the, or if you are mapping to the course objectives and at least one mapping has been made, it will be locked to that course objectives.
You won&#39;t be able to change the program objectives or global objectives. If on the other Hand, if you did not have any mappings done in each of those program objectives and you mapped to the program objectives, the other two will be, it will be, uh, an accessible, it&#39;ll be locked to program objectives.
So this does involve some backend and front end changes. And also this update will be separated out for each academic period.
So if they decide that after the second end academic period and the third one, they want to enforce a hierarchy, then in that case, we&#39;ll show the normal interface that we already have.
Um, and not this existing interface, sorry, not this new interface. So if you enforce a hierarchy, we keep it as it is.
Um, And if you don&#39;t enforce a hierarchy, we&#39;ll show this new interface that allows you to switch tabs and lock the, uh, the ones that you have mapped to.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8f4539a682414595aa58814795905de8</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So Mike, this is another design challenge. So we have a way to select on the case templates page and the program admin portal, you have a way to load a bunch of diagnosis, and these are different diagnosis that patients can have.
So when we load these diagnosis, um, &lt;inaudible&gt;, we allowed the residents to select them when they&#39;re completing it by choosing a primary diagnosis.
So this is a template you create. And then when the president is, uh, submitting it, they&#39;re able to pick one of those diagnosis from a dropdown.
You can log in as John Dorian, after creating a template and see what it looks like. But what we want to do is add a new section where they&#39;re able to specify a limited number of those diagnosis for each template.
So let&#39;s say they&#39;re 5,000 in their system. They want to be able to choose a hundred. And then for each of those hundred specify, um, how many they need to see during a certain time period.
Um, so they just need to select a hundred of them and then put a number next to it. Um, so that it&#39;s, uh, it&#39;s, it&#39;s defined as a minimum requirement for those diagnosis.
So I th I think you could think about what is the best way to do that. I think maybe having a table and you can say, add, uh, add diagnosis and it brings up a window, a model, and you can pick the a hundred and add it.
And then when you&#39;re, once it&#39;s added on the second column of the table, give them an ability to specify a number, um, and that may work, which you can think about it.
And then the second part of this project is showing it on the resident side. So if I&#39;m a resident and I&#39;m opening up a case, I need to be able to have a say, select diagnosis and then be able to select one or more diagnosis that the patient had.
So we, for this, we could probably just use a view tree select, like we have, um, in the past, just like in the, um, um, admin side, when you click the manage diagnosis, it brings up the view tree select for just select the diagnosis.
You can put that here and they can select one or more diagnosis that the patient had. And so that&#39;s, that&#39;s the, um, the first part of this project, then we have to address reporting and stuff later.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/373452cf25c44db0bb0f22a28e94ccc5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Kevin. So for tomorrow&#39;s call, I&#39;m just going through the notes and trying to figure out the best way to present this.
Um, I saw that this course module evaluation was created here. I&#39;m not sure if you made this, a Chris made this, but I&#39;m going to go ahead and review that one.
Um, when I click edit form, not going to spend too much time here since you&#39;re not going to be assigning this in metrics.
Um, and I go to the manager questions page that two things that I want to cover here is one is we have the ability to create questions in here based on just like the form.
In addition to that, we also have the question bank where all the questions can be created and then import it to different forms.
If these questions that are going to be used in more than one form, it&#39;s better to use it. Um, use the question bank.
So you only have one copy and then import them into different, uh, forms. Um, but if it&#39;s only going to be on this particular form, then you can always just create the question on here.
So once, uh, we go over that part, I&#39;ll cover the linking. So this, this is, uh, uh, editing the particular question.
And then at the top you have the link question option. Uh, we&#39;re, we&#39;re working on the, a small update to here this page to make it a little bit of clear.
Um, we have the ability to link to the PCRs or the global objectives, and then to the program objectives and down to the course objectives.
Uh, right now it&#39;s listing out all the course objectives that are in the database. Uh, we&#39;re working on a, hopefully by tomorrow, we&#39;ll have a way to organize this by group, and then we&#39;ll be able to show that you can select different, uh, objectives and map to that particular course objective.
Um, it, it&#39;s a little confusing the way it is showing here right now, where you have all of it listed out.
Um, once we group it by the course, um, it&#39;ll be easier for the administrator to select the one that matches with this particular course.
So I&#39;d go ahead and save that. And then we have two course objectives that are linked to that, and these are the same course objectives that are in the, um, curriculum.
So once the curriculum is rolled over to the next year, then the, the mapping can also be updated by coming back to the form.
The same thing also applies to the, um, exams. So let&#39;s say a pathology final exam. I can go in there, create this, all the questions that you would have in, um, ExamSoft or another system that where the exams are going to be administered.
And then from here, you&#39;re able to map each of these questions to the course or program objectives. Um, and here again, each of these are going to be coming from your, your curriculum.
&lt;inaudible&gt; Um, the main thing that I&#39;m noticing here is because of the way that the mapping was done and, um, we&#39;ll need to show some more context here.
So all of the objectives are shown, but we&#39;ll also need to, um, do a, a small update to group them by the different categories, so that it&#39;s easier to understand which, um, objective that it&#39;s being mapped to &lt;inaudible&gt;.
So once the mapping is done, um, it can be viewed in a, um, let me see if I can pull up a, a tree.
So We have a tool that it&#39;s currently not enabled on the Ross&#39; server. We&#39;ll try to enable by tomorrow, uh, for this call, essentially what it does is it allows administrators to see, um, how the questions are mapped to the different course objectives &lt;inaudible&gt;.
And these, these are the questions that was created in which objective that is mapped to, um, this was originally created for the residency side of the GME side of the metrics, but so there is, um, there is a, a, another setup that I can show, um, after I show the raw data, I&#39;ll switch over to our demo database.
So here is the same tape of hierarchy where you have national objectives or sub, um, in your, uh, program objectives and course objectives, and then, um, sessions, but in the world of the GME, they call it a core competencies.
So competencies and so on, but at the same exact data, um, mapping works. So if you have a bunch of questions that are mapped to a specific, um, sub competency, then you can see how the relationships were created, um, for the assessment.
Um, I w I&#39;m hoping that we can show this level of context on the Ross server tomorrow, if not, I&#39;ll show it on the demo data.
Um, and then explain that this is how it will be shown, uh, for Ross. Once we finished the implementation and finishes setting up the, um, a few of the additional features.
So basically you create the templates and the questions, you map it to the curriculum objectives, and then we can display it in a, a tree map like this, so that you can visualize how everything&#39;s linked together.
And if you want to, if I want to take it a little further, I can even go into the, the reports.
So in our demo database, I can show a User C.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/94db5ecf5b404f8880b05d80dd71c824</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So Mike, uh, for St. James, what you would do need to do is, uh, log into the same game server.
And, um, I&#39;ll send you the password for, since you don&#39;t have access to one pass right now, when you get in there, you&#39;re going to log in as metric support user.
And from there, you can go to the user&#39;s page, add person at faculty and create a faculty account for each of them.
First name, last name and email. You don&#39;t have to enter anything for password is leave a blank for, um, role, just put faculty and the activation date, put any input like a February 1st or something, as long as it is in the past.
They&#39;ll be able to log in, leave every other field blank, and then you can go to the, uh, courses. And then for each of the courses that he has listed on there, you can designate who is the course director, and that person should get permission to edit it.
Um, then go to session, uh, sorry, set up under curriculum permissions. We already have that turned on a lot of course, directors to edit their courses.
And then once that is, once you have the users and the course director set up, go to the user&#39;s page, send an invitation, just select the person that said invite and it&#39;ll send them, um, access to metrics.
You could do one, you can take a look at one of the users and just create a dummy password by going to the edit demographics page and make a dummy password for them.
One of the ones that you create, and then log in as that person to make sure that you see the curriculum with the appropriate course on the left side.
So if you set somebody as course director and log in as that person who should see that course on the left menu under curriculum, and then should have the permission to edit stuff in there.
&lt;inaudible&gt;.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/ccba2dda21534de88f9a4760356d41c5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Onboarding Pain Points</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the onboarding and some of the challenges that the coordinators are facing.
So onboarding is something that happens once a year for residency programs. This typically happens after the match matches when the medical students in the United States, excuse me, find out which program they&#39;re, they&#39;re going to for their residency.
And typically this happens mid-March and immediately after the Mart match, the programs are told which residents that they have mashed into matched into their program, and they&#39;re able to start setting them up in their software.
So the first area of frustration is as soon as the match happens, they have to fill out a lot of their demographic information into there, into this residency, imagine software.
So that demographic information in metrics can automatically loaded because we have a connection with Eros, E R a S, which is a, it&#39;s just an application system that the residents, um, the medical students use.
So as soon as it&#39;s ready, we can, they can click a button and create those residents accounts and metrics with all the demographic information preloaded.
So if they are currently entering that information manually, then we can help facilitate that in an automatic way. So save them a lot of time.
And then after their account is set up, then they also have to collect a ton of paperwork from them. This includes information like the immunization records, background checks, or drug tests or HIPAA certifications.
Each of those pieces of information has to be verified and confirmed before the resident is allowed to see patients. If they miss something and the patients see if the resident starts seeing patients that can be a big liability for the organization.
So we make a, we create a dashboard that allows them to automatically assign these requirements and then keep track of them as the residents submit them, and then they can approve it.
And it gets added to the residents portfolio. The second thing here is contracts. So every resident is an employee of the hospital, and this includes a new ones and the ones that are already there and each of them require an annual contract to be created.
So this is an employment contract for a year that has a bunch of terms in it, just like any employee and many programs are still doing this in Microsoft word metrics allows them to create these contracts automatically using a template, and then, uh, do this for throw 20, 30 residents and, you know, quickly in batch.
So they don&#39;t have to, uh, do I spend a lot of time doing this manually and in the, in the near future, we&#39;re also going to have digital signature so they can send this off for signature to the residents automatically.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c3372371f5b044c484040cfe5553f729</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>New Loom Recording 🎥</pre></td><td><pre>Isha pumps.

Uh, we only need to update this for actually when we update this for this, uh, map to curriculum, this section should only appear if it&#39;s a medical school program.
So remember that we have two different types of, um, programs if medical school, um, we will show this map to curriculum, otherwise we don&#39;t show it.
So that&#39;s the first thing. The next thing is when we create a new rotation. Um, so let&#39;s say we call this new.
Yeah. And thank you to a site, select quantities, select one of these and click save. It gets saved into the inactive tab.
Um, we need to save it as an active, um, and the first time you save it, also, when you click edit on any of these, it doesn&#39;t show an edit screen.
It shows a blank page two for creating a new one. So we should be able to edit the rotation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/496b28bc0d864c9a86e67300161bec53</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this, uh, change, we want to Give the institutional administrators the complete ability to, uh, deactivate a user and also make it clear that which users are active.
So on the, on the institutional portal under users page, we, this is the default view when they come to the page, which is confusing because we&#39;re showing active and inactive users.
So we want this to be, um, renamed to, um, user status. And then instead of yes, no is active and inactive label update the labels for those.
And when, um, they open this up, we want to add a deactivate user button, which will change the status to know.
And if we deactivate the user, we also want to give them a modal that lets them, um, uh, confirm that they want to deactivate all of the affiliations that the users linked to.
It should list out all of the affiliations and say, um, the accurate and is user will deactivate all of these affiliations.
And then that will, um, uh, that will deactivate the user. And then when you go to the no tab or the inactive tab, we&#39;re going to have the activate user button.
Again, this is only on the institutional portal program portal will not see the deactivate use button. They&#39;ll only see the da, uh, deactivate affiliation button.
So when they click the activate user, we&#39;re going to show a model that, I mean, a sweet alert that says, uh, please confirm.
You&#39;d like to activate this user, the user&#39;s primary program X will be also activated. Um, and then they can confirm, and it&#39;ll activate the user and also activate one affiliation for that user.

When a new rotation is created.
We&#39;ll have a section there that allows the administrators to define who the directors are and what permissions they will have.
So this is under system set up on the left side and rotations. And for each of those Individuals that they select.
So the clerkship director, um, they can say edit rotation resources, which is the, uh, an existing permission that we already have for being able to edit the content of a folder.
And then this would be the new permission. We&#39;re adding view evaluations for individuals scheduled to this rotation. So once that&#39;s set up, when we create an evaluation template, we&#39;ll have a section at the bottom that says review prior performance.
If that is turned on, and we have an explanation here, this form will be used to collect feedback from individuals who are rotation directors, administrators.
If the evaluator is also a rotation director or administrator with permission to view, evaluate, should performance show all prior evaluations for the respect to rotations.
For example, if the cardiology director, if the rotation director of cardiology is completing this form, he or she will be shown a section at the top of the list at the, at the top that lists out all prior evaluations for cardiology that they evaluate T had from other preceptors director can review those evaluations easily before submitting their own.
So that&#39;s the setting that we add in each template. You can turn that on. And when a person is completing an evaluation, if that person has a role that matches, um, sorry, not a role.
If they have a setting here in, in the rotation as a rotation director or administrator, and they have the permission to view evaluations and the template they&#39;re submitting has this check box turned on, they will see this section that lists out all of the submissions that came in for that cardiology rotation for this particular resident or student.
And when that individual looks at it, they can see what the status is, whether it&#39;s open, whether it&#39;s submitted and they can click on this, do view that form.
And they could also click a button to submit.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6a4c2047985a4977b0403e9c7ecc9d67</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>For this feature, what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re adding a option to the documents, templates page, which will allow the administrators to hide, uh, the ability to edit a document after it&#39;s generated.
So here&#39;s the design. We have this new option at the bottom. I also added a description for this select document category that we need to add.
But here is, is, do you want department slash program administrators to edit the content of the document after it&#39;s generated?
Yes. Allow full editing of the document? No, it did not. So if the Program administrators have not allowed to edit the document, then when the program administrator does go to generate the document and Okay, let me go to demo.
Oh, let me go back. Let&#39;s see if I can find one I can actually use. Yeah. So this person had a document that was generated employment contract template.
And here I can now go in here and click edit document and make changes to this. So what we want to do is make sure that, um, if the, if the program administrators, I&#39;m not given the ability to edit, then we don&#39;t let them edit the document.
That button should be, uh, should not appear here. And also we want to make sure, and that should be a permission that we, uh, uh, control from the backend, not just hiding the, uh, button.

So if I go to a program portal clue assignments page, it&#39;s showing me nine 1,958 Assignments, and it&#39;s showing users from every single program.
So what we need to make sure that we&#39;re doing is only showing users, uh, that happened active affiliation with this program.
Otherwise they should not show up on this list. And then same thing with the status board. We need to make sure that this is only showing users with an active affiliation with this general surgery program.
And if they&#39;re not active anymore, we should not show them on this list. And also, um, by default, we can Actually, we don&#39;t need you to do anything there.
So just need to filter this, both of these pages by, um, users with active affiliation. And also, I&#39;m sorry, we can also filter this, uh, sort this by last name, just like we do on the assignments page.
So it should be last name first, come off first name so that we&#39;re consistent with this page. And the third bug is on the Okay.
Status board over here. And if I click assign and click, okay, it looks like it&#39;s not assigned, but when I refresh the page, it shows us assigned.
So we need to make sure that, so right now, if I click, if I leave this check and press okay, and we&#39;ll assign, but if I click assign, uncheck this and press save, it does not assign.
So we need to make sure that the page updates, as soon as I click, um, okay. Even if they check is not turned off And please know that this also applies to the institutional status board.
And so does the sorting.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/8e4af4a7365e48ae850e24d9df7f70b0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>GitLab - Google Sheets</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike. So this is a spreadsheet that I had started a few months ago and it was maintained for a period of time, but then it fell apart.
Um, and I wanted to see if we can try to use, uh, something like this to actively track, um, the statuses of different things that are going through get lab.
So when I explain how this works, and then we can work on wiping out whatever&#39;s in here or updating it to, um, to, um, what&#39;s currently in good lab.
I think a lot of these should still be in the lab because they&#39;ve been stuck there. So first thing is, uh, I don&#39;t know why somebody applied to color coding.
So I&#39;m going to just remove that. We can maybe use colors for something later, but for now, first thing that we need to do is just clean this up.
So this is matching up with, um, the issue title here and get lab. Then we have the issue URL, and then the type it&#39;s meant to be used as a, whether it&#39;s a client request or, uh, an indicating whether it&#39;s, it&#39;s a kind of requests or internal project.
So if it&#39;s a client request, we can put the client&#39;s name or we&#39;ll just rename this to, Okay. Something like that.
And if it&#39;s a bug, we have a bug tag. If it&#39;s a critical, we have a critical tag and then who&#39;s working on it, then this one merge request start a day.
This is an important date. That means that&#39;s when we started coding on it. So if I open up an issue and go through here, you&#39;ll see related merge fields.
And if you hover over, um, your shit, hold on, you scroll down. She at the top Created merge request. So, and if we say four months ago, it actually hover over.
It&#39;ll give you the date when it was started. So for all the new issues that we are going into get lab, as soon as it hits to do, we&#39;ll have a date that we can put on there.
Um, so right now, if I go to the board and review anything that is in, um, get lab would be on here, but only anything that is in doing ready for code review needs, testing me changes.
Um, we&#39;ll have a merge request date. And the purpose of this is for us to, um, monitor this list on a daily basis and see if things are getting stuck too long or bugs are taking too long or something like that.
Especially if we can add a column that says like number of days, since the merchant quest start date and whether or not the no status has been changed, Then it can be, Then it can be, uh, something that we communicate with whoever&#39;s working on it.
So I was hoping that you can take a look at this, uh, and start updating this, and then we can meet to go over what the communication system would be to, um, make sure that people are, um, staying on top of some of these urgent or critical issues.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d5cebe6041ad41c08d751e676d48dcc9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>So this is the updated design or a mock up that I try to create to cut down on some of the front-end features they can use.
The setup that we have currently is very flexible and we want to keep the backend for it. However, for our current clients, it&#39;s better for us to try to simplify otherwise they may not configure it properly.
So first thing I did was I tweak that the first option at the top. So what is it? Default workout and logging requirement.
And this is trainees are required, are only required to log hours. If they program enrolled as specified below trainees are required to log hours all year long by default.
However, if their program and role as specified below with the sampling period, they only need to log hours during that during the specified date ranges.
So I understood that first option at the top to mean what&#39;s the default behavior. So whether or not, if something is not specified, the trainees will be required to log hours all year long.
So hopefully this is correcting consistent with what&#39;s already there at the top as this checklist item here. And then next thing is, this is going to vent to be sort of like an accordion that opens and closes.
So if we, um, say, do use, Sorry.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3a1603874a364963bba91f4c0c8a1d9c</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So this is a, a bit of a larger project, which has multiple moving parts. So I want to just describe it and then maybe you can take a crack at it and see what you can come up with.
And you can think outside the box and, uh, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to keep all of these things that we have on this group space, the same, um, cause uh, it may require a redesign.
So the problems that we&#39;re trying to solve for a Talem is they have students that will get added to various groups.
So let&#39;s start at the beginning of the semester. If they&#39;re, let&#39;s say there are 500 students that is coming to the school for medical school, they&#39;re enrolled firearm, founders, quit students in the school and that will be the roster for the school itself.
Then you have each of the courses and typically they&#39;re in the beginning, there may be all the same 500 students, but in reality, they may have some students that got left behind that are going to be taking a particular course.
So like anatomy one-on-one or biochemistry they&#39;ll have another roster for each of those students that are enrolled in that particular course.
And in addition to that, they have different groups that will be created for sessions, such as each, uh, you know, the, the main lecture that happened throughout the year.
We&#39;ll have all of the students going to it then maybe have a lab that happens every couple of days. They&#39;ll have a smaller group that&#39;s going to that.
So we are looking at essentially one is a, uh, one type of group that where it&#39;s locked and sort of like a roster that has all the students, another would be.
And that roster type, uh, group will have a way to, um, you know, basically have a designate. If I&#39;m editing this group, we want to have a way to designate it as a roster group and we&#39;ll check boxing.
This is a roster group and they, in order to add people to that group, we.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/229a6c1b84514934aeef621a5ce64362</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Mike.

And the same thing we, when you click a view, we want the site ID to be, uh, visible on the view info section.
And if I click edit, it should also appear here as a site ID that you can change and all on this list view, we could add a co um, another column that&#39;s called ID, and any numbers of entered will be visible here.
So when you create, when you view, when you edit, and then finally, when you do the CSV upload, we want the sample CSV to include a new column call ID, and then the upload to work with that new ID field.

Uhm, uhm, and I think the, like, I&#39;m on meetings all day long, and, uh, so I figured if both of you are up to speed on this, uhm, you design it and kind of run it by her, and then she can pull in Chris or whatever needs to, uh, some of this stuff that needs technical stuff, uhm, she can be the person
that, like, re-reigns in, uh, Chris and Rio if needed. Uhm, and you&#39;re not blocked on feedback from me or loom videos from me.
So, yeah. So, yeah. So essentially what I was thinking was we start a channel between the three of us and, um, these roadmap items and, um, I&#39;m doing a loom video so that, uhm, both of you can work on getting this into the, uh, uh, pipeline and then for the UX meeting, that&#39;s where negotiations need
to happen with, uh, Chris and Rhea, usually. So, if both of you are up to speed, even if I&#39;m not there, uhm, if there needs to be, like, uhm, getting, uh, uh, Chris and Rhea back from, uh, uh, going down a path of, like, uh, worst case scenarios, you know, that&#39;s usually what happens, like, we present
something, oh, we don&#39;t need to do this because it&#39;s gonna have all these problems, and that&#39;s where there needs to be a negotiation as to which is, it&#39;s a good negotiation, like, uh, yeah, that&#39;s like the, the- A lot of, is the classic engineering and design negotiation that needs to happen, so, But
you don&#39;t need to be, like, that&#39;s the idea of, like, the product owner or a customer, that&#39;s not your role.
Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s the product owner, product manager&#39;s role to do- that, uh, to basically facilitate that, uh, between the two different departments.
Um, so- but I- I&#39;m backed up on everything, so I figured, um, it&#39;s- it&#39;s something that you- we went over this on the UX meeting, but I&#39;m- I want to make sure that Shruti is also aware of all these features, so that, um- problem.
. . it&#39;s something that- if we don&#39;t get this into the pipeline, um, over the next couple weeks, then we get backed up.
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Some of these we already went over, but I&#39;ll have to admit, like, I don&#39;t- I- I think the last comment you had made- And you were gonna make one video?
Yeah. That&#39;s what- that&#39;s what I mean. It&#39;s been kinda sitting on my end, and I- Yeah. So, that&#39;s why we&#39;re going through them, so I can do some videos.
Yeah. Okay. I mean, at least I&#39;m gonna try to be doing videos. Right. I- I think if I can communicate this to two people, between the two of you, you can take care of it.
But I&#39;m always gonna be the blocker, because I- Every day, I&#39;m pulled into, like, new meetings. Uh, so, uhm, essentially is, truthfully, sort of, playing that product owner role, where she can help with getting information that you need from different people and different sources.
Um, and you can do what you do, which is design and put a- into the queue, and then on Fridays, I can take care of presenting it to the developers on the Sprint Planning Meeting.
Um, okay, so the first one. So, let&#39;s go through this AI. Are we recording this? Yeah, I just, uh, it&#39;s a loom.
So, so for the AI, M.S. P.E. comments one. Umm, this is, was one of, suppose we want to reos, uh, uh, goals.
The idea here is, we currently do this in a spreadsheet and give it to the clients of the M.S.P.E. to see the comments that are cleaned up.
Uh, what we want to do is put it into the system. And give them a page where they can say, these are all the comments that don&#39;t have revised versions.
So, if, if you go into the, into the, uh, grade, we got original comments, and and revise comments. So, if there is no revised comments, this is the page where you list all of them, and I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re going to probably need some filters.
Are you that they don&#39;t want to put their advice once you&#39;re doing That we want to? Are you sure that we will want that?
Uh, the idea is that AI is helping. Yeah. Yeah. Are there going to be situations where they don&#39;t want to use AI?
Yeah. But if they, what I&#39;m wondering is, somebody went in and revised it. Now we&#39;re doing like, MFPE season revisions.
Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. You&#39;re, you&#39;re right. So, so yeah. So if you have, and I&#39;m not going to, uh, like, think about the, the design aspect of it because I want to.
Uh, give the problem here. So the problem is, you have hundreds and thousands of comments, and you want to be able to go to a page and see just the comments, but you also want to have enough context to be able to make decision.
So it&#39;s going to be. You know, maybe, I guess, like, a small design thing would be like having a page where on the one side of the, it&#39;s like two columns.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6dd51aa8ec1a46b382712c3d45c66119</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>GitLab Testing Instructions 🛠️</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Shruti, so for testing these tasks, essentially, uhm, I actually don&#39;t remember if we have a GitLab account for you, let me, if not, we&#39;ll need to add, add one for you.
To test this, Well, most Okay, so, yeah.
You do have an account. I&#39;m just going to, uh.
I think you should be able to do it with, uh, permissions that you have. But essentially, when, um, we have a development task.
So if I have one here, the right side of a task, it says pull request. So pull requests are what developers are sending code to.
In general, they call them pull requests in GitLab. They call them merge requests, but we integrated both of them so that we can just click on it and go to it.
And then when we get to this task, there&#39;s going to be a button to go to the branch. So if it says deploy to here, I can click on it.
Let&#39;s see. Actually, for this one, we don&#39;t have the- uhm, deployed yet.
That&#39;s, uhm, otherwise you gotta see the view app button. But I can click this button. You wanna redeploy. It doesn&#39;t change anything.
All it does is send it to the same development branch. So let&#39;s say, let me pick another one. So if I open up, let&#39;s say, one of the newer ones.
And I click this, go here. And then you&#39;re gonna see this view app button. Click on that. So we&#39;re basically, um, having a dedicated branch as in a server for this one feature.
So when we log in, We can use the development instances password in one pass and looks like one of somebody else that tested it already has the LMU CBM loaded up here.
So then once we have it open up, we say we can look through the lume video or explanation and say, what do we need to test?
So this feature, oh, it&#39;s a bug fix, was supposed to be for evaluations, reports, and when we export the data, uh, one of the columns was not getting misaligned.
So, uh, the video should show which column it is. And then we want to make sure that it is getting aligned properly.
I believe it was for, evaluation of clinical experience. Um, the other place that, The other place that we can check to see what it is is we can actually go to the LMU&#39;s, um, server, as a staging server, so I don&#39;t want to go to LMU.
C-V-M dot metrics dot S-G. We can generate the report and see the bug, and then confirm that it was fixed on this branch.
Once this is all done, um, we can just mark off the spreadsheet, and then at the end of the day, we would move this over to code review.
Um, for the code, uh, someone, another developer to look at it. So that&#39;s really the, uh, the process. We click on pull request, go to the branch in, uhm, GitLab.
If it&#39;s already deployed, you can click View app. If it&#39;s not deployed, you may need to rerun it, because we can only have so many, Simultaneous branches.
So it looks since they have 27 in QA, the latest one may not be up there, and if you redeploy it, it should pop up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/bcfa3a9c285a428d91eba988999078c7</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 28 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Kayla. So this is a video of the projects module. This was initially built for a collaborative space for students and faculty members to work on quality improvement and research projects.
However, it can be used for administrative projects as well. So for example, if you look here, we have a site visit action plan.
If I click edit, you can see that this project has to start date and end date. You can have tags.
You can also have project leaders. These are individuals who have full administrative privileges over the project and also have project members.
These are individuals that can have updates they provide such as a comment or mark. A task is complete, but they won&#39;t be able to change the components of the project.
There&#39;s also private projects and public projects. If I turn this on, everyone will be able to see this project and its description.
If I uncheck this, only the people that are part of the project and administrators will be able to see this.
Here we can add attachments. And save it. For these tasks, for these projects, we can also add tasks, such as this one here where I called it, this is a task, and assign it to an individual with a deadline.
They can come in here and add comments. These comments will have a date and timestamp. They can also add files.
When comments and files are added to a task or it&#39;s marked as complete, we send out email notifications. This is a way for everybody to stay up to date on what&#39;s happening in the in the project.
So this is something that&#39;s available. In the platform and you may find it useful to manage your committee action action items.
And this is something that can be used with anyone that&#39;s in Metrix. They would have to have a Metrix account and they would log into their portal and access the projects page.
They don&#39;t have to. They don&#39;t have to be administrators. They simply have to have an account.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/35d696838ddf497d9dae41fd080dbcdb</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>UME Discovery Template - Google Docs - 11 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>In this video I&#39;m going to review how to effectively take notes after a demo. So the first thing that I did was I create the template in the appropriate folder.
So here, under University of Kansas, I went new. Google Doc from a template, and I choose UME Discovery Template. We may already have this set up.
Before the demo, and then the next thing I did. Was start filling out the top section. Here we go. Want to update the title?
SOM process documentation. It&#39;s always called this process documentation with the institution name in front. Then we have a section at the top for attendees and it changes to past.
Prior attendees. And then I linked all of the meetings that we have in attention here with the attendees and then at the top I&#39;m going to write notes about each person.
Once I have that set up what? I&#39;m doing is going through the video and I would go to the transcript section and have a note section on the right side and as I go through.
I&#39;m mainly focusing on what they said to us. This is because I already, since I gave the presentation, I know what I said, I can save some time there.
But for anyone that needs that extra context, uhm, can also listen to what I&#39;m saying. And what I&#39;m trying to do is, I&#39;m not using any AI, I&#39;m simply writing down the process, and any challenges they&#39;re having, and any potential solutions or uhm value that we can provide.
So here, so here, so here, so I&#39;m, I&#39;m paying a lot of attention when I&#39;m hearing this. Right now, this is the challenge with the product they&#39;re using.
I want to make sure I make as much, write down as much detail as possible, so that I can bring this up again.
Umm. Umm. Umm. We need to get a free free free free free free free free free free free free free You So this is a huge point she&#39;s making.
She&#39;s saying there are multiple campuses. Each campus they&#39;re teaching the same thing but they have to recreate the event with all the details multiple times to schedule that.
We handle this really effectively in metrics. Tricks. Where you can have one session and then have different schedules for each of the campuses and you&#39;re not duplicating the event you&#39;re just scheduling it three times and each schedule can have different faculty venue and groups of students.
So here I&#39;m talking about one of the examples. Okay, so essentially this is what I&#39;m doing first and writing as I&#39;m extracting as much detail as possible once I have that then what I do is I go and break it up into the appropriate sections here so that way we&#39;re hearing you&#39;re in.
Reiterating the customer&#39;s problem and writing down in their own words challenges and solutions and then reiterating that in future calls.
Let me open up the one that I finished. So here&#39;s one that&#39;s complete for LMU Decom. Let&#39;s set all the people here.
One thing I forgot to do here is link to the all the attention recordings. And you can see how I for the a student affairs section.
A very detailed process documentation. Same thing for clinicals. And once I have this organized then I can start identifying recommendations.
What are the things that we can target and solve. And for each section essentially we have pre-established insights that we&#39;re trying to get at and how we can simplify their operations.
We&#39;re not creating these as we go. So for example, clinicals. We know that most of these schools are having a poor method for tracking whether or not rotations rotation requirements are met.
And we have a dashboard for that. We know that their elective process is typically manual and I&#39;m trying to get them to that point and then show them what we can do for them.
So I will save this somewhere so that we can use this when creating documentation for each institution. Essentially instead of discovery we&#39;re Thanks watching! I want to call this process documentation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b271067ca7c8441ea2a93d98f2dba41a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Kaiser Breakup</pre></td><td><pre>and so forth. And our community, our UME-GME community, which is made up of 500 GME faculty and probably 250 medical student faculty, um asked that we convene regionally a technology committee, subcommittee of our IGMEC.
And so, uh we created a technology committee and as you know, um Metrix made a presentation to us of all of the changes and so forth.
We also had a presentation by your competitor Medhub, whom we were with before converting to Metrix. And the technology committee strongly supported that.
We also that we migrate to Medhub in 2025. And then, so I know that&#39;s not, you know, great news. I&#39;ve not been a fan of having to give this news yet.
They strongly suggested to our SVP and to us that we migrate over for our business needs. And just looking at the platforms, as you know, KP is no stranger to technology.
And we have some really, really smart people in the room. So we will heed their recommendation and, um, and make that conversion in 2025.
So I just want to acknowledge the journey that we&#39;ve been on together. We, uh, we were, uh, I&#39;m going go back to the next really, um, appreciative of growing with us.
And as we look at the next 10 to 20 years, um, they, they certainly, with additional growth, um, have selected, uh, a different vendor.
So I&#39;m gonna stop there and see if Michelle has a little bit a single stand. Uh, I wanted to add, you know, kind of on what you said earlier, just thank you for everything that you&#39;ve done with speaking to our programs and trying to get some challenges resolved.
And I know that you guys have worked so hard in the background. And, uh, changes and updates and, um, and a lot of it really, you know, really did work.
Um, so, you know, it&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s not an easy decision. And including the work that, you know, we did together with IT cause- that was a whole, um, you know, challenge in and of itself.
So, um, I just want to thank you for everything that you&#39;ve done for us and your platform up to this point.
Yep. I mean, this is a very difficult No news to hear. Um, obviously, you know, I also want to thank both of you for the past five years.
Um, and when you as a team had decided to select hyzer, I mean, select metrics as a platform. We were in a position where, like, we were almost running out of, well, we had run out of money and I was kind of running the business out of pot, like my own.
Expenses and the partnership with Kaiser has allowed us to continue to exist and grow and the last couple years we have become a profitable company and if we wouldn&#39;t exist, if it wasn&#39;t for Kaiser.
So, you know, I want to start off by saying that because if Kaiser didn&#39;t select us we would have not existed.
We didn&#39;t have any more money and that momentum allowed us to survive and get more institutions. And even though a GME has been a more of a challenge with the two dominant players, man-hopping new innovations, recently it&#39;s been UME that&#39;s been fueling our growth.
Um, with institutions like Yale, School of Medicine, and others that have been switching over as an all-in-one platform. Um, so none of that would have happened if it wasn&#39;t for Kaiser choosing us.
Um, the know, it is, it&#39;s definitely, um, difficult because my perspective on this is med hub and new innovations. Um, you are like, I don&#39;t know what the future of GME technology is going to be because once you have that monopoly, it&#39;s uh very hard to, for another company to enter that market and break
it out and what I see a challenge is like an institution like Kaiser leaving uh metrics ends up being a sort of like a uh thing that we cannot really overcome so it&#39;s kind of um what I see is if the once that change happens it&#39;s more of kind of focusing on the UME side it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of hard for us to
really gain momentum in GME if it&#39;s if if people here like oh Kaiser was on metrics and they left. Um.
Mm. Yeah. We&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re certainly not going to be promoting the change. You know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s going to stay at Pektorm you know as far as we&#39;re concerned our faculty and we haven&#39;t even socialized it with you know and.
Thank you. And made any type of official announcement we&#39;re going to be really careful about that because brands is everything we understand that.
I I remember way back when when we were we were one of the first two people who signed up with Medhub.
I I remember. That vividly before Stanford before all the U seeds and so forth. So we we really take that change very very seriously and I I&#39;ve seen you grow in the U.
M. E space and I think that that space will continue to be super successful and we hope that G. Me a boy congratulations with the sign on for you.
I&#39;m I&#39;m delighted. It&#39;s been really exciting to watch your team grow as well. We we&#39;ve really enjoyed working with you and it&#39;s not over yet.
You know we I hope I hope we can run both systems simultaneously for over a year. We&#39;ll need to. It would be a mistake not to.
As we look at technology especially institutionally, boy I&#39;ll tell you institutionally I&#39;m just being slammed with some workarans and so that&#39;s that&#39;s I think.
One of the main things that are Igmaic and technology subcommittee just really wants to to anchor into a you know a different platform and I think that was one of the compelling reasons and we won&#39;t go into all the tactics.
Umm and I know that you&#39;re moving into more space of AI and I can tell you medical student education needs that and I think that that is going to be your uh your leverage uh to to expand in that space.
Again you know I I had no idea that we were the ones that gave you the cash flow to exist.
I&#39;m certainly not going to repeat that anywhere. Um but it&#39;s been really fun to grow together and difficult. Yeah but there&#39;s peaks and valleys and growth and we we&#39;ve managed that.
So I just want to say thank you to you and your team for the endless phone calls and emails from KP.
It&#39;s been rewarding and challenging at the same time. Yeah and I mean uh up. And when it comes to um the migration is it something that is going to happen over the next year and I&#39;m asking like if um it is.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f207dcb4aaca46a68945e63cab7495c9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Benefits - Google Docs - 29 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen, so I&#39;m looking at the benefits page and I wanted to point out a couple things that&#39;s happening here one of the things is when I click on this drop down shows up in the top left here its weird and its on some sort of bug on mobile seems to be working fine on desktop and then we have this table
that we have to scroll horizontally which we had to address and turn it into a card so as your scrolling down its let me move my head out of the way here and as your scrolling down you can see everything instead of having to do a horizontal scroll when we factor that description field here we also will
need to do something where it has a limit and if you have more than let&#39;s say 50 characters umm it will just say dot dot dot and they have to click on it to view the details cause otherwise uhh it may get actually lets skip that part I dont think this is going to be an issue for most of these requests
its going to be pretty short umm so the create date, requested date umm and then you click on view details where you bring up this window and we want to make this a little bit more uhm uhm mobile optimized one is these font sizes are a little wacky you have created it&#39;s larger than requested uhm I guess
it&#39;s kind of breaking it up into two sentences I mean two lines line break here date and then request created by uhm we can probably display this as the date and then put request created underneath it and not bold or we can bold it let&#39;s see we can just remove the word request and say create it and keep
it bold by John Dorian and then but don&#39;t increase the size of the font we can bold it without increasing the size of the font and at the top we have the name, account, so the account and category its a bigger font size than the actual name a page should have the font hierarchy and it should align well
so this request details is a page header it should align with the content and then the name of the person should be the largest larger than the account and category uhm so if we apply this uhm this font size to the John Dorian and then everything else on the page being the same body text font and apply
use the bold to highlight different elements so the only thing that I will be a little bit larger will be the John Dorian name and then the rest of it will be same text size and then anything that needs to be highlighted as titles or labels will be bold and we also want to avoid horizontal scrolling
here so the request dates and join the comments instead of showing it as a table we can show it as a a card so there&#39;s no need for a horizontal scrolling and let&#39;s see how it looks on the desktop yeah same font size issue here so we wanna create a good font hierarchy so that it doesnt look like its its
a bug See you later. Good luck. Alright so I think that&#39;s pretty much it here on the request date model or request time off Uhm uhh let&#39;s add some padding here so that these 2 fields and labels are not touching each other and for full day partial days lets fix the alignment and here on mobile looks like
the only way that I can get the time to show up is if I click into this little clock we should be able to click anywhere in this field or this gray button here to get the time to show up.
The submit and close buttons we can do it as full width where close takes up half the button and submit takes up the other half</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/0396f83ee2534308962837dc7c21f8ff</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>AT Still University SOM in Arizona Medtrics Proposal - PandaDoc - 17 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Cristina, here is a proposal that our team put together for your school based on our discussion and we&#39;re including all of our modules so you kind of look at this as the upper limit of what it would look like if you were purchasing the full system for all four years including every module that we
offer. Starting at the top we kind of outline all the different modules as well as the different services that we offer.
And something that I want to highlight is the subscription includes all of the support that is needed to maintain it For example all administrators receive live chat support So you can open up that chat window from anywhere in the system and reach us And this goes directly to our team in Philly Where
you can Initially it&#39;s usually uhm Questions about how to use the platform Eventually it becomes more questions about Best practices.
It&#39;s very helpful for administrators and also for new users in the in the future. We also provide uhm on On-demand training initially during the onboarding process.
This is done as part of the onboarding meetings that we do for Series of months so typically one project is about three months and let&#39;s say your clinical processes, it&#39;s be three months of weekly meetings and During this process we built out the system with you, set up everything and then get you trained
. After onboarding is done, if you need additional training or you hire a new team member, then we can provide on demand training, you use our schedule.
To your our support calendar to get that scheduled Metrix also includes a knowledge base with videos and articles for all of our modules and then our our annual subscription includes all of the product updates as they&#39;re released and here we have a list of all of the different modules And a brief description
of that And as I come down As I come down here it also outlines some of the so theres our standard modules which are based on student license licenses and then theres the standard modules.

So a couple of thoughts on the design. Overall, I really love this logo. Great work, Ericsson. It kind of puts everything together that we were talking about with the medical and the microphone and it&#39;s easily recognizable.
One of the things that I&#39;m looking at this overall is the Med Edge, the colors, being a little too similar to what our metric, like initially we want it to be similar but also don&#39;t want it to be confusing that like as if we&#39;re like we&#39;re changing the company name.
So I went back to the original design colors that you had which it was a little different than the metrics colors with the red, I mean the orange.
And then the building tomorrow&#39;s health care kind of looks a little out of place when it&#39;s broken up like this, like to have it in one row.
And I&#39;m not a fan of using all caps because it makes it hard to read when you&#39;re looking at it. so I wanted to run this by everybody, not this one.
Again, I&#39;m not a, as a great designer, as Eric, since I&#39;ve been here for a long time. This is just wireframes for talking about ideas and Eric&#39;s and can put together the nicer versions.
So this top version is using a radial gradient and it still has the bottom. It&#39;s bottom is without it and then down here I made a poor attempt at drawing a chat bubble.
I did what we managed and then I have a chat bubble that&#39;s just building tomorrow&#39;s healthcare. With the logo on the left side and then in the actual icon that shows up or the thumbnail, we would just have this image.
The part I&#39;m debating about is whether we want to have this gradient and orange color behind this or we want to let it stand alone.
Love to hear your thoughts and if there&#39;s anything else that you can think of, one main thing is that we should either, we should definitely have it in one row.
If you want to put it all as lower case, we can try that also, but I think it looks better if it&#39;s camel case like the not camel case, but if you capitalize the first letter of each word so that it lines up with the top.
Anyway, we&#39;re getting close. We&#39;re almost at the end here and we all agree that this is the logo that we should go with.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b8d43b0c895a4bb98ecd96c973aab760</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>(7) Feed | LinkedIn - 6 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, Savannah. I hope you&#39;re doing well. I wanted to send you this custom GPT that I created for those comments.
So essentially how it works is you&#39;re finding all these posts and when you&#39;re finding one that is great and a form of someone that we want to interact with, you can take the screenshot and go into here and you should be able to set this up on your end and how it works is it wrote a custom prompt that
hopefully will write a comment. In the way that I would write it and we can still do the editing on the google doc for while we fine-tune it but my hope is that as I fine-tune this you&#39;re as you find these posts or people that you want to interact with you can just use this to write as if it&#39;s me so
let me try it again it&#39;s not letting me copy this so put that there So, usually, it&#39;ll give something like this sometimes.
I&#39;m not a fan of like how chatdpt We&#39;ll see you next time. It writes some of the things that&#39;s in there like I would never like rephrase exactly what they wrote.
So usually what it once it gets me this let&#39;s see. Awwww. So, like, something like AI regulation is under intense scrutiny with safety programs underway and then, like.
And then, like, I would just choose, like, one sentence out of this and keep it simple and, and then, and sometimes it gives me that one sentence by itself, but I guess because it&#39;s a big post with a lot of stats, it kind of summarizes everything.
Let&#39;s try another one. Let&#39;s try this post from Marcus. Yeah, so I think this is a slightly better response and I&#39;ll show you how, what my Bye!
Is like. So you can see, write unique response for LinkedIn posts, select a comments style randomly. So I put in these comments styles based on a, a PDF that I found on LinkedIn.
Of different ways to respond and there&#39;s I forgot which creator created this, someone did. And then I have these samples in here and then I also have a about me.
And so this is what the tool is using to write these responses. It&#39;s still not perfect, but I think it&#39;ll give you something that is more in line with how I would write it.
And then it&#39;s a matter of picking and choosing. If it&#39;s a long response, picking and choosing a sentence from there that keeps you concise, because I&#39;m not someone that writes really long posts or responses.
I like to keep it simple. So I hope this helps. Let me know your thoughts and once we try it out, we can see if it&#39;s something that we can improve and then get to a point where it&#39;ll just give you a good output that you can post.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f4b57e6b65d64909a0f1828aee2bc7e5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 4 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Karen. So once you log, once you get access to one password, it&#39;ll give you the passwords for different servers.
So when you go to demo.metricslab.com, this is a demo environment that we use for customers for when you&#39;re giving sales demos.
If you want to log in here, you can use the admin at metricslab.com and then put in that password. And this will get you into as a super user.
This will give you a portal that gets you access to pretty much all the functionality. But for the work that you&#39;ll be doing, you can go into here and then log in as one of these two users, John Dorian.
Or Perry Cox. If I go to log John Dorian, it&#39;ll take you to the student or resident portal and then you can click around on these pages.
See what all the different functionality that we have here. If you log in as John Perry Cox. You&#39;ll have a couple of buttons at the top right one says admin portal and the other one says personal portal.
You can toggle into the personal portal from there. So this way wanted to get you some access to those. Pages so you can play around with it.
And similar to the demo server, there&#39;s also other customer development servers. So for example, UTSW is another one where I can log in as.
And for this one, you use the development instances password, dev instances, and then you can put that in here and sign in.
And once you&#39;re logged in. You can log in as Bonnie. This is one of the medical students. It&#39;s a demo account.
And play around with that account too. And lastly, once you have access to this development instances password, you can also go to docs.metrics.dev and use your GitLab.
To get into the documentation. So this gives you a bunch of the documentation. Thank you very much. Thank you. For the developers that Rio will be going over with you.
But if you want to get a head start, you can start looking through this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e323620258654e5693e13b79ffa59e09</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Beautiful.ai - 6 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So what we&#39;ll do here is take a look at an example with a oversimplified neural network. And you can think of on the left side we have a input, in the middle we have a hidden layer, and then we have an output.
And let&#39;s say we take one of our data, one element of our data and it describes a car and it has four wheels and two, four wheels and four seats.
That&#39;s going to be our input. Four and four and then the neural network is going to essentially initiate random weights for the first attempt.
For each of these weights that we see here, we&#39;re going to initiate a random weight and then we&#39;re going to multiply and add the value of each node with the weight.
We&#39;re going to take, to calculate the value of the next node, we&#39;re essentially going to multiply the input. With the weight and then add it together with the input multiplied by the weight of the other node that is pointing towards the node that we&#39;re trying to calculate.
So if we look at this node here we have two arrows pointing towards it. To get the value of this we&#39;re going to multiply the node times the weight of the first one, node times the weight of the second one, and then add, there&#39;s a variable that I&#39;m not going to go into today that you add to it also and
then you get the value of this second node. Same thing here, we&#39;re going to multiply this first node input here.
That layer, multiply by the weight, input node, multiply by the weight, add it together and we get this second hidden layer node, and we&#39;re going to do it again and we&#39;re going to get the final one.
At the end, you&#39;re going to get a value and it&#39;s going to allow us to essentially predict whether it&#39;s a car or a car.
So you can see here that we predicted that it&#39;s a bike and then we know that it&#39;s wrong because we have the label and with this label we can go back and update the values of each of these weights like we did when we were adjusting the faucet in the shower.
Essentially we&#39;re going to calculate the error, how wrong it is and then we&#39;re going to use a method called backpropagation and update these weights because we got it wrong.
We&#39;re going to try again, the next car or bike, we&#39;re going to attempt to calculate it and then if it gives us an output of a car and it&#39;s correct, then that&#39;s good.
If it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;ll calculate the cost function again. And then do back propagation and optimize the weights again. So over time, so we talked about different types of training and we talked about neural networks and there is what scientists do is mix and match, mix different types of training models
and neural networks to create new solutions. And one of the approaches for creating content is a generative adversarial neural network.
The way that it works is you have two neural networks One is going to be creating fake data or fake image and then another one is a neural network that is trained to identify whether an image is real or fake or basically you can say it&#39;s going to create a photo of a dog and this Just a model is trained
to identify if it&#39;s a dog or not. So as this model start generating these images, the second model will say, hey, that&#39;s wrong.
And then it&#39;s going to update its weights and try again. So you can see how with this method, we can train an AI model using a second AI model that is giving it feedback.
When we use the word algorithm, we&#39;re talking about a computer algorithm that is not trained yet. Once it&#39;s been trained and optimized with these weights, for making predictions or generating data, we call it a model.
So what exactly is a transformer? In 2017, the Google brain team published this paper called attention is all you need and essentially what they came up with a, is a newer type of neural network that performs significantly better in training.
Using sequential data and sequential data is anything that has meaning in a sequence, which could be your. And, we have sentences genetic sequences, we have videos, so essentially that has data that has meaning and sequences.
And the approach that they took is, it&#39;s a self-supervised, or unsupervised, or self-supervised, or unsupervised learning, where, unsupervised learning with large data set.
What the tool, what these transformers do is, it takes large amounts of sequential data, and then embeds the relationship, ship.
Within those data points as numbers. And you remember, in our previous discussion, we have those notes, and then we have those weights.
Those are what is known as parameters. Heh heh heh. And it&#39;s going to store that as, to get a better understanding of how this works.
To, to get a better we can sort of look at it, when we look at this picture of the United States, we can see a greater x-axis and a y-axis that go from 1 to an 280 and the x-axis and 100 to 180 on the y-axis.
If we look at Washington over here on the top left, we have value of approximately 30, I mean 30 by 30, 30 by 20.
And then we look at Florida here, we have 160 by 230. By looking at the x-axis and y-axis values if we compare two states, just by looking at those values, we know that they&#39;re close to each other or they&#39;re far away from each other without I&#39;m sorry.
Not even looking at the map or without knowing the name. So you can kind of see how an x-axis and y-axis in one dimension and two dimensions were able to represent the name, essentially the name of a state into numbers.
What transformers are doing is doing this at a large scale. They are taking different sentences and extracting the relationships between those words, and they do this by looking at large amounts of .
Texts, billions of sentences, and by looking at that, it can say in reading this sentence, the word it has a relationship with the word animal, because it says the animal didn&#39;t cross the street because it was too tired.
As opposed to this sentence, where it says the animal didn&#39;t cross the street because it was too wide, and it&#39;s embedding this into the neural network differently so that the values of these are going to be different in the neural network, and these neural networks, these transponderance.
Formers are huge. In the example earlier, I had two layers, three layers to the neural network. The, the GPC4 that ChatDPT uses, it&#39;s 120, 120 layers and I think 1.8 trillion parameters in it, which weights a note.
So you can see how complex text can be embedded there. And exactly what it does is transformer essentially has two components to it.
It has an encoder which takes the text and encodes the features. Or the relationships between the words. And then there&#39;s a decoder that&#39;s creating an output.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f843938194424fb38302741495edbc70</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - AI Curriculum Mapping</pre></td><td><pre>As a technology company, one of the scariest things you can do is come to a trade show and reveal a new feature Well metrics did it this year with our AI curriculum mapping It&#39;s the first time that we&#39;ve ever used artificial intelligence within inside the metrics platform And so I&#39;m going to go right
to the guy, Tosh Cherry and CEO of metrics We came here, we&#39;ve unveiled this new feature, Tosh, did you hear complaints?
Did you hear crickets or did you hear cheers? How&#39;s it gone? I heard excitement You know, one of the things that we were concerned about when you&#39;re building a new AI tool is If we&#39;re gonna put all this money effort into building something new, is it going to be something that&#39;s impactful for the The
community and we realize that we were right We and our goal when we build something new with the I is how do we decrease you want the time it takes to do something, right?
So with I want to show you a tour of this tool and the biggest thing that we realized is that faculty members are often given access to these tools, but they don&#39;t have enough training in particular mapping and also they don&#39;t have enough time.
So, both of these things are addressed with the AI tool, basically the AI is giving them recommendations, which means that they don&#39;t have to figure out how to do all the mapping.
And the second thing is it gives that recommendation allows them to do the mapping in a Well, your team has been busy doing demos ever since we got here.
We have a dead moment right now. I think people are taking a break after lunch or tush. Let&#39;s just take a quick dive or show us how it works.
Step over here, and our curriculum tool was built from the ground up for AMC&#39;s standards. And one of the things that I want to show you here is, you know, I&#39;m not going to go into the full curriculum demo.
I&#39;m going to pretend to be a fact that the team for a pharmacology, pharmacology is one the core courses that a medical student has to complete.
So imagine this, a mythology of four pharmacology or a core director for that, and I&#39;ve created these five lectures. Antimide Probial Pharmacology, drug metabolism pathways, introductions to pharmacodynamics.
I&#39;m going to click on my lecture here for introductions to pharmacodynamics. I&#39;ve created nine sessions objective for this. These sessions objectives now have to be mapped to the core of objectives for pharmacology.
In order for me to do that, I can click in here and just remove the mappings that I have. I have to click into here and say, explain the concept of drug receptor interaction and how does that align with my course objectives.
And if I come here, I have 10 course objectives that I can select from. Imagine the brain power that it takes to align a sentence with these 10 sentences.
I have to go in here, read to them and say oh this one aligns with it or this one aligns with it.
It takes a lot of time and energy. But with metrics AI, I can click a button. The AI has recommended three force objectives that match with this session.
And then what&#39;s even better? We provide you with the reason why the AI recommended it. Because that&#39;s a lot of, that&#39;s one of the things that is challenging with use it usually is a black box.
So we provide you with a sentence that says, why did the AI think this course objective is a good fit?
And then as a faculty member I can read that and I can agree with the AI and save it or I can say I don&#39;t agree with it and just exot of it.
So this takes a fraction of the time and for my trying to do this manually versus doing it with the AI, say me about for some of my time doing this mapping.
So, for that time, I can use it for teaching and developing new content, and which is what I should be doing as a faculty member.
So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re very excited about, and that&#39;s what some of our visitors were excited about.

So this I love this logo on the right side here, number three. The only thing that I&#39;m wondering is how everybody feels about the building tomorrow&#39;s healthcare.
Actually that&#39;s not the only thing I have a couple other thoughts too. Essentially I&#39;m not a fan of all caps because it makes it a little harder to read.
And the other thing I&#39;m wondering is how can we do this slightly differently so it&#39;s not building tomorrow&#39;s and it almost looks like the healthcare didn&#39;t have enough space to fit there.
So it was kind of just dropping onto the next line. If there&#39;s some other way that we can orient this so it looks like it was like it&#39;s more symmetric.
Let&#39;s see. Well, we&#39;re not going to show this on the icon itself. Well, one idea I have is like, what if we put the icon smaller or next to this meta, metaedge and put the tagline all the way under so it&#39;s like the full width of the icon and metaedge.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6ca40f249ec241fab9a44750cec260f9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>RFI- Residency Management System - Google Docs - 7 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>So for this section please furnish your company&#39;s service standards.

And when it comes to the support process, we provide an in-app live chat tool that these clients can reach us by clicking on it and messaging us and they can email us.
They can have a phone number and we also provide on-demand calls for additional training and essentially we respond to our customers within two hours and then resolve those issues within typically within a day or two and as far as customer success we do quarterly check-ins, we have a knowledge base that&#39;s
built into the platform, we do monthly webinars and we also typically accept feature requests and build those and communicate them with with our customers when they&#39;re released through their monthly webinars and for any bugs or any issues that come up with the platform with which it&#39;s usually prioritized

At that time we discussed creating a proposal for 9,000 students at Chamberlain and it was my understanding when we came up with the pricing that we would have the students onboarded pretty quickly.
You know it&#39;s in a reasonable time period and we offered that price the pricing of 9,000 student volume discount based on that understanding because normally when you week price for volume all of those licenses are getting activated at that time.
For Chamberlain after we come up with the rate was discussed with the institution. . . And we learned that these onboarding projects cannot go on pretty quickly and that it has to be staggered one after another.

I should I sent this to Keona, who I was working with for the, for that proposal. It shows a breakdown of the Chamberlain programs, the total number of trainees and the volume discount that was applied.
Essentially, we were providing the discounted rate of $40 for a volume of 9,000 students. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s what we do.
It came up with the pricing. Soon afterwards, we realized after discussion with the TALM and CU teams that these programs are not able to come on live quickly.
And that we need to spread out the implementation over time and we agreed for metrics that we would provide a this volume discount from the beginning.
And maintain that price. Even though we didn&#39;t have the volume. So over the next year and a half, we added the PMH AGNP and FNP program.
But the largest cohort of these students still have not been activated. And we&#39;re past one year from this, you know, we started in 2022 and now we&#39;re approaching the end of 2020.
We still don&#39;t have the volume and we&#39;re significantly below what the volume should be. So the request for CU is we&#39;re not asking to adjust the discounted rate.
We&#39;re asking that. We can activate these student licenses or at least have them paid for by the end of this year and then have a six month period where you&#39;re not paying for it, but you&#39;re, you&#39;re going to have a six month of activating it by July.
So you&#39;re paying, you would be paying for it from Chamberlain before the end of 2023. And then the licenses for the students for the PSN program would go live in July.
So that way Chamberlain is still only paying for the active use. We&#39;re able to capture that revenue this year, and all of our discounts that we&#39;ve been maintaining for Chamberlain was with the understanding that there&#39;ll be 9,000 students.
Because we have been taking a loss on all these earlier, smaller programs waiting for this larger cohort to start. This is also something that would allow us to start on, some of the custom development that Chamberlain needs.
The BSN program has some unique workflows that we could integrate into metrics, but it requires some development time. And we do not want to start that process until we have this in place because it is, it&#39;s not a quick, it&#39;s not a small task.
It has some larger components. That needs to be modified to, especially to get their clinical learning contract automation in place.
So that is something that we&#39;re still planning out. But, if we can get this paid before the end of the year, we could get started on that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/42fccecb930c4941bd0e7e473b1a7646</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Rotation Request Userflows – Figma - 12 September 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hey, Mike. So the idea here is when we are creating a request as a student, it will go to the admin and then we&#39;re giving the admins the ability to approve or deny.
And when they deny the request, we want to give them a text field at the bottom and that will allow them to send.
That back to the student and the student will be able to open it up and resubmit. When they reopen it, the denied status will be shown along with the administrator comments.
One thing that we can actually remove here is the name of the administrator because we&#39;re not going to capture each person that is saving it.
We&#39;re going to just have one text field that is Thanks. With comments and the student side, they&#39;re simply going to see the comments.
They&#39;re not going to see which administrator added it. So we can remove the name from here. And then from the Thank you.
And from the hemming side, we&#39;re also adding that filter so that they can filter by pending, approved, and denied. And one more thing that we can make sure that which I believe you already did here, you put a box around it to make sure that the devs see the ability to enable the setting and add
this text to make it clear that it&#39;s 30 days from now. Sorry for confusing you there, I was trying to do too many things at one time.
Bye-bye.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/61cf488044a743cfb88e176e65a19107</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating Evaluations and Assigning Them</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Kathy. So I wanted to create this video to go into a little bit more context on some of the questions that you had since they&#39;re related to the meetings that we had.
So the first question, resident will fill out an evaluation on the self with the site supervisor If this is going to be something that is done by the resident on a weekly basis, this is best created as a rotation evaluation since it&#39;s going to need the context of that rotation.
So, and once it&#39;s created on the assignment rules page, if you go down to when should this be assigned or should this be automatically assigned, you can do that.
On a weekly basis, like I believe if you do seven day, well, you&#39;re gonna have to plan this out a little bit because if all the rotations start on a Monday, and then if you do this as a number of days after that, start date, count the number of days to the next Monday, and then that will be the first
assignment. Then you can add another day for the second assignment. So as long as it&#39;s timed in here, you can add multiple rules so that it goes out each Monday.
If your rotation is four weeks long, I recommend doing 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and that&#39;ll take care of four assignments.
It may not always be on the Monday, but at least it&#39;ll be close enough so that they&#39;re getting it every week.
But if you want it to be going on a specific on a Monday, you have to look at the start of that rotation, what day of the week it is, and then put in the number of days so that you&#39;re hitting the Mondays.
Second question, you had a 360 evaluation of resident. Is an evaluation that should be done by anyone as needed on the resident.
So, this should be a program evaluation. I believe it&#39;s set up as a program eval. And it should be anonymous, that is correct.
Actually, no, it&#39;s currently set up as an event evaluation. You would want to click edit and then change this to a program eval.
Type and then once it&#39;s made as a program eval if you want it to be done as needed instead of getting it automatically assigned you would choose the open evaluation functionality so this would be should this form be available as an evaluation, if you click yes, then anyone in the system that has the
role of evaluator will be able to select the form, choose one of the residents and complete it as needed. Metrics does not allow people to submit this if they don&#39;t have an account.
In metrics, so if you need someone to do this they have to have an account created. We don&#39;t limit the number of accounts you can create so you can make as many accounts as you want for staff and faculty members.
One thing that I also want to note is that 360 eval is something that, A lot of programs do assign it once a year.
So if you want to assign it, you would have to use this should this form be assigned option. You can have it as both maybe assign it once a year so you do get some feedback.
Have it available so that people want to complete it they can. Next question is I have a conference seminar evaluation says event type but can&#39;t figure out how to set it up so that people evaluate the event on the speaker so the.
Conference 1 here. So you have this set up as people in the event. So questions on here should be about evaluating someone else.
But if you want to evaluate the event itself, you&#39;ll need to create a copy of this form on the templates page like we did for charts and then create a different assignment rule where you&#39;re assigning it to evaluate the event instead of a specific speaker.
If you only want to tackle this as one form, and I think that&#39;s a slightly better way to do this, is to keep this as an event evaluation where you&#39;re evaluating the speaker, but you can also add some questions in there.
To say, provide feedback on the event itself, so you&#39;re collecting everything in one form. That way the resident does not have to complete two forms.
So basically combine the questions into one form where you&#39;re collecting feedback on the speaker and the event and then assign it.
Based on the event. Clinical skills verification evaluation for site supervisor on the resident, but not on a certain day. Should this be a rotation evaluation and how do I, is that if it isn&#39;t sent out until requested.
So clinical skill, crush the device. For site supervisor. I think that can be done as a program evaluation because if Let me see if I can find that one here.
Clinical Clear Verification. So, it&#39;s currently as a session. We want to change this to a program evaluation. There&#39;s two ways you can tackle this.
The first is on the assignment rules, you can make it so that it&#39;s not, you can put all the rules in for Evaluate your evaluate T and then set this up.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/4376513352104e21ae794a6f6d1b2486</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 23 March 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Alright, in this video we&#39;ll be going over a few different bugs slash usability issues from forms page. Click on edit.
So forms part two. Actually let&#39;s make a new form here. Call it, Lotation Evaluation. Lotation. Lotation. So we&#39;re gonna, New question.
Cast. It&#39;s 1030. And save. So first thing here. Gee, let me do one, One more thing. Log in as support user.
Templates. Okay, so first thing here when we have this. Once I select. Okay, let&#39;s start again. So the first thing is let&#39;s remove these white boxes that are in the question.
Because they just show up and it looks like it&#39;s broken. So remove that. And then if I choose. And then if I choose an option, it&#39;ll show these icons.
We can just show it without having the white background. One thing that you&#39;re noticing here is that if I open these and I have something selected.
I have to go back and uncheck it. So what we want to do is make sure if I turn this on, when I click out of it, it disappears.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. So if I do this for the first time. Let&#39;s do this. See now it doesn&#39;t disappear.
I have to go and unclick it. Alright, so that&#39;s one and then edit question. Let&#39;s say if I make this a text question and save it.
Oh, we could, we also want to make make it so that when you&#39;re editing a question you don&#39;t accidentally click out of this.
So it should only disappear if I click save, can&#39;t or cancel. That&#39;ll prevent users from losing where they are. So let&#39;s say if I make this a text question, click save.
When I come back to this page, it&#39;s showing it. It still has a Likert question. And the only way that I can get that to show it correctly is if I refresh the page.
And click edit. And now I&#39;m back into this model and it&#39;s showing the Likert option again. Even though it&#39;s a text question.
So we want to make sure that it comes back to whatever question type it is. Alright, and then if I go to.
Preview. Let&#39;s do this. Preview. That&#39;s not correct. It should be showing it as a Preview. So now it&#39;s showing all of this as text fields instead of, instead of options.
So if I save this, it shows up correctly. But when these directors are adding these questions, it&#39;s frustrating for them to see.
The options show up all weird and doesn&#39;t show up correct unless you refresh it. So at the very least if this is a very difficult task to fix, let&#39;s force a refresh so that it shows up correctly.
And then when. Let me go back to this model. If it&#39;s a text question, it needs to go back to a text appearance instead of a liker.
And then when you go to preview. It should show up properly over here. Okay, so there&#39;s a few different weird things happening and it&#39;s been frustrating for the directors who are creating these questions.
So we want to make sure that it shows up correctly. Not applicable. That works. Okay. Edit the question. Save. Let&#39;s try something else here.
I am. Templates edit. So now I&#39;m seeing a question. Here. That is since red text saying this inactive. And it can be removed, but I don&#39;t know what question it is.
I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s going to be something that&#39;s inactive here. So if a question is inactive on the question bank let&#39;s show the show this message in a food strap alert.
It&#39;s easier to read and then show the question title there so they can correct it. So, coming back down here.
This is a competency question that was added. For this competency question, let&#39;s also add a question. You may be hearing Alexander in the background.
He doesn&#39;t want to go to sleep. So, Okay, so this is core competencies updating it. So, medical knowledge, I&#39;m gonna move this to, I&#39;ve.
One, two, three, four, five. Okay, that&#39;s working. Alright, so the last thing to update is the previews. So if I go to the preview tab, you can see that the comment field works here.
But if I go to the preview here, it doesn&#39;t work here. So we want to update this, this page to make sure that the preview works.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/95b6052dad104b49ba582eb84e7f77c3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 30 November 2021</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at how to set up the data before an academic period. So whether it be a new semester, starting a new session, starting what information needs to be reviewed and updated before that semester starts.
So the first piece of that is the sites under institutional portal sites. We have a list of all the sites.
Eventually we&#39;re going to be giving the permission to do that from the admin portal, but the same steps will apply on the sites page.
We need to review all the sites and if there&#39;s any new site that needs to be added, that can be added here.
And if any site needs to be removed, it can also be updated here. Um, as part of the sites, the first thing to add is the site&#39;s name and site ID and designated as external, since there&#39;s going to be an external site to the one that the preceptor, uh, where the preceptor are working, if you have lots of sites that need to be important, it can be used.
It can be done using an import template. It&#39;s download this template, update that section, the sector required sections and import them back into metrics.
Once the sites are set up and confirmed, the next step is updating the rotations. So I&#39;m now in the admin portal under rotations in system set up here, we have all of the rotations that are available for this particular primary care program.
This needs to be done both for primary care and acute care and each rotation, the way that we&#39;re naming them.
It&#39;s based on the clinical experience that they have when they go there along with the site name. So we&#39;re putting that into the name of the rotation, and then when a rotation is created, it&#39;s also being linked to that site.
So if I click edit on one of these, we can see rotation name and select the site that it belongs to.
The code is just an abbreviation for the rotation name. And then once the rotation is added, clip this first button to designate the preceptor for that.
So every rotation should have the site linked to it and a preceptor selected. And it, and um, I also want to add that if there is, there are new preceptors that need to be added to the system that can be done on the users page.
So any, every student and preceptor that is new to the system can be imported using a spreadsheet. So this download sample CSV, can we use to import them and set up their accounts.
Once a users import it, they need to be invited so that they get an email with a temporary password. In, in a, in addition to importing them, they can also be created manually.
If you have one or two users that need to be set up, simply go to add person, student and create a student account or add person faculty instead of preceptor account.
So faculty in the system is just a user type. So all the preceptors do fall under the faculties are tight.
When a student graduates or preceptor leaves the organization, it&#39;s important to deactivate their program affiliation. So you can click on the deactivate program affiliation, and that will allow you to go through a deactivation process and make sure that their account is inactive and they won&#39;t be able to log into the system, but you can still run reports and look up their account if you want to, by simply going to the inactive users section, Last piece of the setup is evaluation templates.
So for every template that is set up in metrics, it&#39;s important to go and add any new rotations to those templates.
So if I go into the assignment rule section, there&#39;ll be a list of all the available rotations. And if there&#39;s any new rotations that were added, um, that needs to be added to the templates so that metros can automate the evaluations.

So you have three and then it should be four, sorry. Um, 3, 5, 4, and then four. So a 3, 5, 4, 4, and then March is down here.

If you remember, the requirements, module is something that allows us to, um, collect documents from different individuals.
So if I&#39;m doing this on the program, admin portal, I can assign requirements for users to submit if I&#39;m doing it on the institutional portal, I can assign for our users to submit across the entire institution for different programs.
So you may want to like assign one by going to the templates page, creating it, assigning it and completing it just so you&#39;re familiar with the use case and existing functionality that the change that we want to do or add here is, um, right now, if you have signed on a requirement to an individual, that individual has to go in there, submit it, and then the administrator can approve it.
And that document gets added to the students or faculties profile in the, uh, one of the things that come up in during onboarding is there going to be certain tasks that we don&#39;t want the individual user to submit, but it&#39;s supposed to be submitted by the administrator on behalf of that user.
So what we want to do is when you create a new template, add a setting at the bottom, that&#39;s says, um, and making probably clean this up a little and then out a setting at the bottom that says, um, only allow submissions by administrators or something along those lines.
And if that&#39;s turned on this particular requirement will say under type, it&#39;ll say administrative use only, and then on the personal portal.
So let&#39;s say if I assign that to all the supervising physicians, and then I go to the personal portal, I go to requirements page, I&#39;ll see what was assigned to me as a student or faculty, but under incomplete, it&#39;ll say administrative use only.
And I won&#39;t be able to complete it myself instead. It&#39;ll just stay there. And when the administrator completes it, I&#39;ll be able to, uh, see that it was completed under the completed tab.
And then I can have a view button to bring it up in a model and view what was submitted, but not actually edit the actual submission.
So this review, we&#39;re going to update the institutional template. I mean, the program admin and institutional template creation pages to have a setting at the top bottom to make it administrative use solely once it&#39;s assigned, it&#39;ll show that it was administrative use solely on that list view on, on the personal portal for the residents and faculty, it&#39;ll say that it was assigned as well as indicate that it&#39;s administrative use only.
And then when, um, uh, when I, you can&#39;t submit that on your own and when the administrator submits it, you&#39;ll be able to see the results, but not edited.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/13a15b306f2f48e89bb915e42c3500a3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this particular task, we want to try to expand the usage of our PDF dot JS plugin that&#39;d be bought and use it to open up more of documents in more places in metrics currently, if you&#39;re only using it for a PDF on one of the pages.
So I go to documents and these documents and click expand, sorry, generated documents, click on this. You can see that it opens up in a PDF viewer, but in other parts of the system, we don&#39;t, we&#39;re not using it.
So we want to try to update a few, few more pages to take advantage of this new plugin that we&#39;re paying for.
Um, on the program admin portal, when you&#39;re in the view profile page for documents and certifications, We have multiple documents here.
We want to add, we want to update the buttons on the right side. So we have, um, two more buttons.
One is reviewing or initial or editing, sorry, view, download, edit, and delete. And we can sort of Copy from one of the other pages.
Let me see. She from resources where we have the download button icon here, delete, edit, and we can also have a view icon, which we can borrow from this preview icon.
So if I click on view, it&#39;ll open up in the PDF dot JS. If we want to support like multiple file types and font downloaded, they just click the download button.
So that&#39;s under documents, it certifications. Then on the left menu, we go to documents, manage documents. You want to do the same thing here?
So if I click expand, I want to be able to, uh, view the file instead of just downloading it. Now, if I go to resources, same thing.
You want to add a view button here so that it can open up in a PDF dot JS without having to download it.
And then next thing is on the personal portal Under my profile, whenever they&#39;re looking at my profile, we want to be able to update it similar to the documents and certifications to have where we have four icons view, download, edit, delete, and it&#39;ll open up in the model or plugin.

I wanted to create a video to explain this a new project or the same project that we picked up again.
Uh, now that, uh, the COVID situation has settled down and students and everything are back in school. So I&#39;m working on a slow bit on the same, uh, computer science professor that you had met, uh, last year.
In addition to that, I have another radiology faculty member, as well as a, uh, professor of human computer interaction at Georgia George Mason university.
That&#39;s working on this project now. So last time when we spoke, we had, uh, talked about using, uh, this project as a potential for a commercial project, uh, development and a commercial application.
We decided that the first step is for us to just do it as a research project and with the grant.
And then if we&#39;re successful, explore the commercialization opportunity. So we are now applying for an NIH grant, uh, applications due in a couple of weeks.
And the idea is still similar to before where we&#39;re tying to take a radiology report and then create a simplified version for the patients to easily understand what is wrong with them.
And then the idea is also, um, we have Evolved it a little bit where our goal Is not necessarily to explain everything to the patient in this report, but is to give them enough information to understand, um, what is urgent and what it&#39;s not urgent so that they can, uh, you know, they have less confusion and less anxiety, uh, than when they are receiving a complex report from the radiologist, uh, without talking to their doctor first.
So, uh, if I were successful, what we want to do is create a artificial intelligence, uh, uh, platform that will take a radiologist report in real time, um, creates a simplified version, gives it back to the radiologist so that they can review and approve it.
And then the hospital can send the simplified version to the patient along with the full report. So this is a probably going to be a two to three year project to try to get this done.
Um, the first step is going to be to quantify what&#39;s the gap in understanding between the radiologist&#39;s intention intended language and what the patients are actually thinking what certain phrases mean.
And once we quantify that, we want to create a simplified version of many radiology reports that can be used to train a machine learning model, uh, and that will automatically generate these.
Um, so, so I wanted to share this with you. And, uh, um, we are also submitted for an IRB waiver for the data, um, that was submitted, I think, a week ago.
Um, we are now just finishing up the proposal, which is spin along a document. And I wanted to ask you if it&#39;s possible for us to, um, get a letter of support from you to include with the application, uh, because, um, having institutional support will increase the chances of us getting this NIH grant.
So if you have any questions, let me know when I can now also do a call with you to go into any more additional details of the project.

So this feature can only be done after we do a couple of changes.
Currently we have, Hey, home institution, field that is only on the student and resident, um, demographics page. So this home institution, this is currently linked to the GME program.
Um, but what we need to do is update this field so that it&#39;s linked directly to the, um, the user model in the, in, in metrics.
And then what we can do is, um, once that task is done, then this import task can be completed. So we also need to write a migration for this, and this is going to be a separate task, but I wanted to just mention that this current tasks that I&#39;m describing should only be done after doing that part.
So this particular tasks that are designed is going to work like this in the institutional portal, we have the permissions page where we can allow a program to create, uh, edit or remove users.
We&#39;re going to add a second column there where we can give them the ability to do bulk import. If that&#39;s turned on, then we&#39;ll have a user&#39;s important users button on the program portal.
And this is only going to be on the program portal. And if I click on import users, this model will appear where they can dump, download a sample CSV, and then have custom customized instructions.
So this instructions will show what the default values will be. They don&#39;t need to specify that in the CSB, if I&#39;m importing from the school of medicine program, it will default any imported users to a school of medicine, if, and then also put the primary site for that program as, um, as a default value.
So the important file will not have these two fields, but it automatically be set. And then the import file will need to have roles for each student or user or whatever they may be.
And we&#39;re going to list out all the active roles for that program here, so that the person creating the CSV will know which roles that are available to use.
Once we submit a file, it will show a message that says you will be emailed when the import is complete, and then they can cancel the import or upload the message.
And when the import is complete, we&#39;ll send an email with the success message and any failed, uh, import. And it lists out which column had the data issue so they can troubleshoot.
I also have additional instructions in a text here, which explains how we&#39;ll be doing the import and some of the validation that we need to do.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/59a2003f738b4a61842ea78e0b438ea5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Untitled – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>For this feature, what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re adding a option to the documents, templates page, which will allow the administrators to hide, uh, the ability to edit a document after it&#39;s generated.

But here is, is, do you want department slash program administrators to edit the content of the document after it&#39;s generated?
Yes. Allow full editing of the document? No, it did not. So if the Program administrators have not allowed to edit the document, then when the program administrator does go to generate the document and Okay, let me go to demo.
Oh, let me go back. Let&#39;s see if I can find one I can actually use. Yeah. So this person had a document that was generated employment contract template.
And here I can now go in here and click edit document and make changes to this. So what we want to do is make sure that, um, if the, if the program administrators, I&#39;m not given the ability to edit, then we don&#39;t let them edit the document.
That button should be, uh, should not appear here. And also we want to make sure, and that should be a permission that we, uh, uh, control from the backend, not just hiding the, uh, button.
Thank you so much.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d4ca639505d3451084383c521a41357a</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So for this, uh, task on the institutional portal, as well as the program portal, under requirements and act to require requirements, we have this table that shows out all of the active requirements.
Unfortunately, this is not something that people can export. So what we want to do is, um, at a export to Excel file at the top, right?
So this is going to work similar to the way, um, we go to demo for a second So this is going to be like the, uh, blue download button.
Um, we don&#39;t need a dropdown. We just, it can just be download to Excel. And when they click that, it&#39;ll export a file that have all of these, uh, columns in it.
Um, it&#39;ll be we, we want to break it up a little bit more granular here. It&#39;d be last name, first name, role, the requirement name, um, requirement type would be whether it&#39;s institutional or program and then document category requirements, status, deadline, um, submitted date, um, and then document expiration date, then file name of the document that was submitted.
So that would be the con the, the doctor that we need to create. So I&#39;ll, um, just open up Excel here.
So when we&#39;re ex uh, when we&#39;re creating this, we want to use a standardized header. Um, We may have one of the XL reports that we already have, can be used for this.
Let&#39;s do So there you go. So we can do, um, a design like this, and it&#39;s going to show, um, instead of academic period, it&#39;ll show the date that it was ex exported, and then any of the criteria that was selected up here.
So it&#39;d be a selected requirements, selected users, select roles, select a date, um, filter by dates and the date range.
So we want to have a section at the top that shows these criteria, And then The different column headers I mentioned.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/33e2ef91df65494fb233f9ceab2f5050</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So this particular task has to do with requirements. So I&#39;m going to log in as, um, metric support user, and then either from the program portal or the institutional portals, we want to apply this to bolt.
We go to assignments under requirements, and you can see here that we have different requirements here. And, but we don&#39;t have a good way to export this out of metrics.
So what we want to do is give them the ability to, um, have a download button here. This will be a standard like blue download button, like we have on the, um, assignments page.
So it was gonna be download to Excel. And then If they select any check boxes, you want to only select, only download those.
Uh, but if it&#39;s they click download without selecting everything, anything it&#39;ll download the full list. And the download button does not require a dropdown, just download to Excel, that&#39;s it.
And when you download it, we also want to that Excel file to have our standard, uh, um, like a report design.
Um, so you can Borrow The design from the, um, the course rotation mapping. So it&#39;ll have a header. And then here, it&#39;s going to show you the criteria.
So instead of academic period, and with status, statuses will show, uh, requirements, users, roles, status, filter by type filter by dates, and then it&#39;ll show you whatever option they chose and then a date range and the dates that they chose.
And then for these column, headers will show all of this data, but we&#39;ll be breaking it up a little bit more granular.
So it should be, instead of users should be first name, last name, role requirement, name, um, document category requirement type, which will stay institutional or program.
Um, if it&#39;s institutional requirement, we&#39;ll say institutional, if it&#39;s not institutional requirement, it&#39;ll say program then status requirement, status, um, deadline submitted date and a document expiration date and submitted document.
We can attach to submit a document in an Excel file, but we can, um, put the file name in there.
So that&#39;s the, the task. And then we want to also apply this for the institutional assignments page and the program admin requirement summit page.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/91488c9b94894defaf3b8144990ba7d0</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>This particular issue has to do with changing the assignment, uh, role and having the VI requirement assigned properly. So right now, if you create a requirement and choose a role, it will get assigned correctly.
But then if you could change and add a new role and you click save, you will not get assigned. So for example, if GME checklist is assigned to administrator GME, checklists here, you will see a center, three people that as well administrator, but if I go to templates and then change this and put this for, well, one more thing to note here is that the sweet alert that appears on the top, right?
Shit up here after the model has closed. Um, but I added a PGY one, two, three, four, if I go to active.
Okay, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s still assigned to these three people. You did not pick up together new roles. So we need to make sure when we&#39;re editing our template and saving it, it assigns to all a new additions and the new additions could be roles, could be roles, groups, or individuals.

So this feature for adding a field to site, what we want to do is write up a task where when you create a new site, we want to add a site ID field below the employer field, and it&#39;ll be a text field that they can type into.
And the same thing we, when you click a view, we want the site ID to be, uh, visible on the view info section.
And if I click edit, it should also appear here as a site ID that you can change and all on this list view, we could add a co um, another column that&#39;s called ID, and any numbers of entered will be visible here.
So when you create, when you view, when you edit, and then finally, when you do the CSV upload, we want the sample CSV to include a new column call ID, and then the upload to work with that new ID field.
And in the specs, we want to make sure that, uh, this ID field does not break any of the reports that we have that utilize this site.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/d9f353afd57643e199f82a5e3e6cd608</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>Hey Mike. So we have a few different tasks to do for groups and I&#39;m going to describe them and then maybe you can work on the mock-ups.
So, first thing that we have to solve is we currently have to create a group and then you have to add individuals to those group one by one, which is a very tedious process.
So what we want to do is update the new group window to be something that is similar to this auto create groups, where we can select the name, the academic period, and then be able to include a lots of individuals, but using their role, other groups or individuals, and then, um, also linked them to courses if needed.
So this is basically going to be a way it&#39;s a similar to the auto-generate. The only difference is, um, we&#39;re not going to be creating any sort of naming convention or how many groups do you need.
So it&#39;s possible for you to combine the design and make one model, um, maybe make it so that it says create groups.
And if you, um, choose to create more than one group, then the, um, the naming convention can appear and they can choose that.
But if they only choose one group, they can just fill it in and just click save, and it will create that one group.
So the pro the main problem we&#39;re trying to solve with this particular, um, task is adding the ability to select many users at once using the roles groups or by individuals instead of our current workflow, which is to create a group and then open it up and click manage people and add a bunch of students, one by one, this, this takes forever to do that.
So that&#39;s the first one. And then the second thing is for a way, for them to add a student to a bunch of groups in batch.
So right now, if we creating a group, we were going to be able to add a bunch of students into that group, but the opposite also, the other, other variation of that is I have a new student that just got enrolled and that person needs to be added to a bunch of groups.
So what I&#39;m thinking there is, Um, on the profile page, we could have a section somewhere, um, maybe on the under intro and then have a section here that says a, um, member of a group membership, and then inside it&#39;ll list out all the groups that they&#39;re part of and give them the ability to, um, click edit, and it&#39;ll bring up a model and less them, um, add or remove them from groups all at once.
So it can have a bunch of check boxes next to each of it, and then say, uh, add students to all of these, or remove students from student from all of these.
So that&#39;s one way to approach it. And then that model, we also need to have a way to select academic period because we&#39;ll have different groups for each academic period.
So that&#39;s the second problem. So there&#39;s the first problem we&#39;re trying to solve is being able to add users in bulk to groups when they&#39;re creating them one by one.
And the second problem is at ability to modify an individuals groups all at once either to remove them or to add them to a bunch of groups.
And let me just make sure that&#39;s everything So that&#39;s the thinking world we did then. Yeah.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f12c5b678b8747e0b92a2b936b466844</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>How to Initiate an Evaluation for Residents | Articles | Medtrics | Intercom</pre></td><td><pre>So for this article, it looks like it was something that was created and made available to everybody. It says everyone can view.
So, um, it&#39;s better for us to limit the access to this, um, for different, uh, residents and faculty members, because this is covering how things are done on the trainees and the faculties, portals, not the administration side.
Um, also the ways that, um, we&#39;re covering these things, not all programs will set it up, um, for them to be able to request evaluations and not all programs will use the opening evaluation feature.
Um, so what we need to explain here is, um, all of these features are still the same, but if it&#39;s not turned on, then they won&#39;t have any options in there.
So on the resident&#39;s portal, um, on the right side, under the request, uh, one thing here is like, we don&#39;t want to, um, put the URLs in here into the documents.
Like this is, it&#39;s better for us to explain it based on the user interface. Um, so we can say on the dashboard of the, um, the resident&#39;s portal and instead of residents, we can call trainees.
So it applies for fellows also on the right side, you have the request evaluation feature, and this is used to request evaluation from an attending or peers.
Um, and it&#39;s something that is, um, you&#39;re you&#39;re if, if you&#39;re working with them and you want to collect any evaluation from them, any program that allows you to do that, you can go in there, select the template, then choose the train, uh, the evaluators name and what rotation you work with them.
And then it will send an email notification to them to assign up to complete that form. It also will create an assignment to that person.
So you&#39;re basically assigning an evaluation for them to complete, and they can either fill out the form or they can Mark it as unable to assess.
The next thing is from the evaluations page itself. Uh, this is to, um, complete an evaluation for somebody else. So, um, it really should not be mixed in like this, the way that it is because the first one you&#39;re actually requesting an evaluation for somebody else.
So we should have an article called, um, how to request evaluations, um, from a faculty or peers. And then that should be covered this topic.
And then the second one could be how to initiate an ad hoc, um, or open evaluation. And that should cover, um, going to the evaluations page, clicking the create open evaluation, and explain that when to open that form up, depending on the template, there&#39;ll be asked to fill in the information, whether it&#39;s the purchase, evaluate T&#39;s name, the rotation, um, or if it&#39;s a course, evaluation will be course information, whatever the information that the form needs, it&#39;ll ask you to complete that, and that will let them complete the assignment.
And the other thing to cover here is once you started an open evaluation, it&#39;ll appear on the list of, uh, to do.
And if you change your mind, you can go in there and delete that, um, entry from your list. If you don&#39;t, if you no longer want to complete it.
And then the last piece is, um, your normal assigned evaluation. So this probably should just be turned into an article that says, um, completing assigned amount, how to complete assigned evaluations.
So in this article, we can cover, um, this to-do list and explain that trainees and faculty members can go into the, to do lists, um, see all the ones that are assigned to them.
And if they want, if they need to complete it, it&#39;ll, uh, click the view evaluation button, takes them to the form and they can complete it.
And if they, for some reason, it was incorrectly assigned or they did not have enough experience working with them. They can submit it as unable to assess.
Um, there&#39;s a search bar at the top, and there&#39;s also a filter that allows them to filter the, uh, assignments, if there&#39;s many on their list, once it&#39;s completed, it disappears from this list and it goes to the completed tab where they can review all the ones they have completed in the past.
So my opinion on this one, as we turned us into three articles, one is how to request evaluations from a faculty or peers.
Another one is how to initiate and open evaluation, or I would say ad hoc slash open evaluation. And then the last one is how to complete assigned evaluations and this complete assigned evaluations.
We can also mention the email notification say that, um, your institution will be sending you a reminder emails to complete your, um, pending forms.
And when you click on that evaluation, it&#39;ll take you to that, uh, form and completed right away. And, um, um, the other thing to cover here is If I&#39;m on the evaluations page, I open it up.
Then I can, uh, explain that, um, at the there&#39;s a save dropped option that allows them to save it. And then there&#39;s also a way for evaluations to be sent out as a notify and alert.
So you can mention in there that if an evaluation has a alert turned on, if it&#39;s used to send that alert, it&#39;ll send that email to the, um, program administration immediately.
So then a couple other things that you can be mentioned in the, in that last article, which is about completing assigned evaluation.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/42dd460d4a604ea58428795ab93b425e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>In this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the different features that are available to residents and fellows for logging work hours.
So the key things to highlight for residents and trainees in general are the, are the, uh, the, um, two ways they can log hours, one on the desktop, and now the one on the mobile.
So, uh, in order to log hours on the desktop, there is this calendar view, which can only be used when there is a schedule that is published.
So one of the things that, uh, we often get in support is a message saying, I can log hours because it&#39;s telling me to contact my coordinator for our schedule.
So on this page, if I try to, for example, drag and drop hours in here, and there was no schedule entered for the two, three a, it will give me an error message.
Let&#39;s see if we can get a screenshot of that. &lt;inaudible&gt; This is what that looks like. You do not have any schedules, um, for today, check with the administrator.
I will just paste this to the bottom. &lt;inaudible&gt; So assuming that they do have the schedule entered, they can either drag and drop from the top and then adjust these hours up and down, or they could click into it and then use this widget to enter hours.
And the way that this one works is, um, it&#39;ll show you what rotation they were currently working on. And then they can select a shift type, the start time and day, and then click save.
There&#39;s also a way to copy the last shift that was used. And then it&#39;ll just, pre-fill the same shift again.
So if they work in the same hours every day, then it will just keep repeating that. And here we can also change the dates if, uh, you know, drag and drop, um, or the manual entry is successful and they want to just keep copying the same, uh, same shift over and over.
You can just click this little icon here. Uh, this is an important thing to highlight because a lot of people miss it and they keep entering the hours from scratch.
So they just click once. It&#39;ll just keep repeating daily. And I also want to highlight up here. We do show the, um, the days that they&#39;re on time off, um, in the all day section here, we currently don&#39;t show the days that they&#39;re covering different rotations up here.
Um, but it will show the days that they have approved, approved time off. And then if we shift over to the a month view, that shows you the same information in a different format.
And we can also see that on the log page is a table view that lets them view, edit and delete Dinetia any, uh, enters any hours they have entered.
And here we also have the option to repeat and I&#39;ll just copy over to the next day. Now let&#39;s, uh, change over to the, uh, mobile view &lt;inaudible&gt;.
So on the mobile view, we do have a way to select a shift and click add shift, and it will bring up this calendar view that where you can select a start time and an end time, and they also have the ability to, uh, edit, delete and repeat any, anything that they have already entered in a, in a table view.
You can also shift between the days there.

So for, uhm, these are the outstanding items from MSU clerkship. This here is one of the new ones that came up in the last call.
And let me show you what that is. So on there, schedules, clinical schedules.
If I open up one of these schedules. I click at it.
There&#39;s these checkboxes that show up underneath it that is marked as enrolled, and what we want to do is change this, so that they, in the system setup settings page, for the institutional portal, we&#39;re going to add an option that says integrations are enabled, disable manual enrollment, and if that&#39;s
turned on, instead of showing this checkbox here, we&#39;re going to simply show a, uhm, bootstrap label that basically sort of like this one week label that is either green or red, and, uhm, it would say, uhm, enrolled, and if it&#39;s not enrolled, then it&#39;s going to be red, that it says not enrolled.
So that way, there you can simply see that enrollment is done, but they won&#39;t be able to manually uncheck or check it because they are currently using integrations and we don&#39;t want someone to accidentally uncheck it.
This also applies to the, uhm, audit page. Where we have this enrolled checkbox. So, if, uh, if this setting in the institutional portal that we&#39;re adding is turned on, then this would become, a label, similar to edit, that says enrolled, or, or not enrolled.
If the checkbox in the institutional portal settings is not turned on, then they would still be able to, uh, check the box off.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/89ae15bc27fc4a65a4bef483a8603296</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding the nohub Value 📊</pre></td><td><pre>There&#39;s several hubs that was added to the system and there&#39;s also an option called nohub. So this is a value that was created as a custom field and right now there are two hundred sites that have a value of nohub.
So having a value of nohub is different than this field being blank. If the field is blank, then it has no value.
And our assumption was that if there is nohub, it would have been blank. So we assumed that, Assigned our own, uh, blank value called nohubassigned.
And then we&#39;re also realizing now that there was a, a, uh, nohub value that was assigned to 200 of these rotations.
Uh, these, uh, sites to the optimizer, if there is already a value there, it&#39;s treating it as if its own hub.
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s treating it as there&#39;s a hub called nohub and, uhm, that&#39;s not going to work for the optimization.
So, I, I believe the correct way for us to handle this is to change all of these values that were set as nohub to blank so that we can use our standard, uh, blank value, and then the optimizer would only be treating these actual, uh, actual hubs.
As foundational hubs, and then anything else that does not have a value, it&#39;ll be seeing as nohub assigned, uhm, and it should work.
Uhm, please let me know if that is correct, uhm, we can go ahead and remove this nohub. Options, uhm, from all the sites that had it, and then leave it as blank, which will then get the nohub assigned option, and then that will, and will run the optimizer again.
Also, if there are any other issues, it&#39;ll be helpful for us to get those , uhm, sooner than later, because we can try to have more versions, uhm, generator for you before Friday, so that, uhm, we can just basically run through the schedule when we, when we meet.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/3cc7385362ef499bb41a3e12288fb1c6</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Creating a Medical Education Course 🩺</pre></td><td><pre>The goal of this project would be to create a course that could be used to train the employees of Metrix, a medical education software company, on how a medical school operates.
The platform is, is sold to medical schools to manage the entire academic journey from the first day till they finish their, uh, uh, fourth year of training.
And what we want to do is, um, one, tell the story from a medical medical school, medical student perspective where we are going into each year of training and explaining the type of experiences they have and how the, the day-to-day, uhm, uh, experiences would be structured for a student.
with some examples. We also want to tell the story from a, a faculty member for the pre-clinical and the clinical, uh, uh, courses and rotations and tell their story and explain how, uhm, they, how have, uh, they operate on a day-to-day basis.
Uhm, and then we also want to, uh, speak, uh, have, uh, chapters about the admissions.
Uh, administrative departments and how they operate, some of their priorities, uhm, the different types of deans they have, uhm, such as curriculum, evaluations, assessments, their, Student Affairs Department, Enrollment Department, IT.
Then, we also want to look at it from different, uhm, processes, such as how do they manage, uh, competencies, their, uh, uh, evaluations, their creation of the MSBE letters, uhm, clinical schedules, lottery of their schedules, uh, case logging, how that threads into the different training, uhm, So,
the, as this employee, new employees go through this training, they should get a very broad understanding of medical schools and how, everything about it.
Uh, it also should be written in a fun and engaging way, with each of the major personas having a character and going through their, their story.
Uhm, and then for the other, other parts of the system, uh, go into examples and sample data. Uhm, so every chapter has several, uh, smaller sections that can be covered in short videos or reading assignments, and then, uh, eventually we will also create quizzes, uhm.

also, so we have to add columns for course code, course name, uhm, and then for start and end, uh, actually, we can probably just use the existing fields where it says, instead of saying rotation code, we can call it rotation slash course code.
If it&#39;s a rotation, it&#39;ll show a rotation code. If it&#39;s a course, it&#39;ll show a course code. And then rotation slash course start date, rotation slash course end date.
And we can, we also want to have another column for event name, event date. And then session code and session date.
That way we&#39;re covering all of the different evals that we have, uh, on the assignment status, because right now it only shows the details for rotation evals.
Oh, one second.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6ace849698124e6dbef04ac0690d3eee</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Site Optimization Review</pre></td><td><pre>Everyone went through, uh, these issues with the Optimizer team and identified some, some, uh, challen- uh, some of the issues that may have caused that result.
So, first thing that I, uh, wanted to go over was this site availability sheet, that this is what we use to populate the capacities into the system and into the Optimizer.
So, when we look at this, there are, uhm, rotations, or courses, that is, like, CBM 770, 771, that have available to schedule.
In blocks, that are, uhm, past, uhm, block 5. So, for example, here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, they should only have available to schedule up to block 5.
But we can see here on this sheet. There are multiple ones I only selected a few of them, but there are many that have available to schedule past block 5.
So, when we convert this into the optimizer, uhm, it is scheduling past block 5 because it is marked as available to schedule.
Uhm. If, you know, uhm, we can go in there and just clear out all of the ones past block 5 and mark it as blank so that it would just basically eliminate everything after block 5 until terms of availability.
And this would remove those for the optimizer. But one of the things that I&#39;m a little concerned with is if this was what the availability was initially.
Uhm, I&#39;m wondering if this was also what the students were, uh, making preferences in. So if there were prefills that were made, uhm, but what we get, uh, you know, the first step that we can do is if you can confirm that it&#39;s okay to just clear this out, we&#39;ll go ahead and clear it out and run the optimizer
again and see what we get. But that seems to be the biggest cause of issues with, uh, with the, uh, results.
Uhm, the second item here is just going through these, uh, So, for the, uh, there were some, uhm, that were in the wrong hub, that I, uh, we figured there was an export that was done from Metrix with all the custom fields for hub, and I think there were more hubs that were added after that.
After we did the export, so, we did another export today, and, and this filled in a whole bunch of extra, uhm, hub, uh, categorization for sites, so, now we have more hubs to find, so hopefully the next time we run it, that should address something like this, where, it was probably putting them into
two different places, uhm, because there were a lot of, uh, sites that did not have hub defined, since we did the export, before some of those were entered into Metrix.
So that will take care of, those two things that we found will take care of, uh, most of these problems.
The only other, uh, one that we also need to discuss is hub capacity. Um, I don&#39;t know if there was a miscommunication with, uh, this hub capacity.
I think in my, our initial note said that hub capacity is something that we need to implement. Um, and then there was a later note that we had that, uh, we only need to use the site capacity and hub capacity can be ignored.
Um, it&#39;s possible that maybe there was something else we didn&#39;t capture that accurately. The second time, if we can let us know if we need to keep track of hub capacity, then we can implement it if it&#39;s not needed, we will hold off on that.
And then for sites getting assigned to the same hub, I went back. I back to the rules and then reviewed these.
This is something that we also need to address from our end. Uhm, we&#39;re gonna add this rule to make sure that it&#39;s not getting assigned to the same site if they are doing two courses.
So this will handle on our end. The hub capacity, if you can let us know if we need to implement it and then for, uhm, the availability one, uh, let us know if it&#39;s okay to clear out these ones from the original site availability spreadsheet and then we can clear that out and run it again.
And I think that would take care of all of the things that we need to address.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/71f579219666433ab2a56d2e7989d0f9</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Revenue Generation Strategies at Metrix 📊</pre></td><td><pre>Metrix generates revenue from two types of clients, hospitals and universities.
And within hospitals, we sell to medical education departments that sponsor residency programs or, or hold, uhm, training programs for medical students, nursing students, and allied health professionals.
In the university market, we sell to medical schools, nursing schools. veterinary schools, and other allied health schools. Primarily, we are serving, our primary university segments are medical schools and veterinary schools.
That&#39;s where most of our clients are. And, uhm, uhm, currently, we are focused on the medical school and veterinary market, with, uhm, a secondary, uhm, focus on the graduate medical education.
Metrix provides a large enterprise SAS platform that is, it&#39;s a SAS platform that is used by these hospitals to manage all areas of the student journey.
So, as a medical school, they can use it to manage all four years of training in one platform. And, uh, Metrix is deployed across different departments such as clinical education, preclinical education, evaluations and assessments, um, student affairs, registrar, each of these different organiz- uh,
departments within a medical school or veterinary school will use Metrix to manage their training. their day-to-day operations. Uh, in addition to our large- our main SAS platform, we also provide a, uhm, uh, optimization service that is used for generating schedules automatically for medical schools
and vet schools. Uh, Metrix is sold as an annual subscription, which is paid up front, and the subscription cost is determined by the size of the school.
So if there is, uhm, the size of the school and the number of modules, so there&#39;s about, uh, uh, uh, twenty different modules that the platform has, and a school can decide whether they want to buy the full platform or select specific modules.
And based on the number of modules and the number of trainees they have, we would calculate the annual cost. And then, then, we can also charge, we also charge, uh, one time implementation fee for the first year that allows us to have process development and implementation with them.
Some of the modules that we offer are schedules, schedules which allows them to generate schedules for all, all years of training, uhm, evaluations including competency management, uh, case logs, patient and, uhm, uh, in the, in the hospital world and for GME departments.
We do IRIS reimbursement, uh, cost reports which is submitted to the federal government. Uh, we also, for medical schools, we generate the MSPE letters automatically saving them lots of time.
Uh, curriculum. Curriculum mapping for medical schools and vet schools as well as for nursing schools and allied health. In terms of is there any customer supply concentration risk and concerns, uhm, we do have one large client.
That, uhm, makes up a little over half our yearly revenue. But it is one, one institution that owns multiple medical schools and vet schools.
So even though it is one agreement, I mean, even though it&#39;s a, uh, one buyer, the actual contracts are with each of the different schools.
So they are, uh, independently deciding to use Metrix. And, uhm, but it was all brought to us through one parent company named Metallum.
We have been mitigating that risk by onboarding other larger institutions so that their, their, uh, concentration has become less over the years.
Metrix, uh, is a, a, fits in the middle of the learning management and workforce management market which has a market, an estimated market of approximately four billion.
Four percentage of the market share does, uhm, in the medical school market, probably less than, uh, five percent in the med school market, probably close to twenty percent, and, and GME, uh, residency market, probably less than five percent.
We primarily serve countries in the United States, but have, now have contracts with, uh, a couple of international schools, including Mexico, and we&#39;re in the process of finalizing agreements in Philippines and in Israel.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e7e0df9dd1c4476297db0df1a6234aaf</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Understanding Metrix in Medical Education</pre></td><td><pre>The main competitors for Metrix is different based on the market segment. We currently serve four segments, which is the physician market, nursing, allied health, and veterinary.
And each of those market segments have companies that provide specialized services. specialized products for education. In the physician market, there&#39;s medical schools and there&#39;s residency programs.
And the major competitors there are MedHub, new innovations for the residency market, and for the medical school market, it&#39;s, ah, Elantra.
Um, Da Vinci, E-Value, and Exact. And the, ah, these companies are specialized to their segment and also provide products that are, limited to that specific segment metrics, is able to serve across the board for all healthcare programs and is built as a flexible platform that can be used, uhm, regardless
of the type of training. So, if you are medical school, you can you can use it for four years of medical training and then, uh, if the medic, if that institution also has residency programs, you can have the same, uh, software being used for the residency program, which allows the organization to have
an enterprise deployment and have all users only, uh, only have to learn one platform. The, the other strengths of the, the platform is, uhm, usability when it comes to, uhm, workflows.
It, given that the platform was designed by insiders who worked on a medical education for many years, it incorporates workflows that are easier for our customers to understand and require less training.
So, typically, some, some platforms take a couple years for them to fully deploy the platform. With us, they&#39;re, they&#39;re, uh, we&#39;re able to get up and running relatively quickly, sometimes in months and get their entire organization aligned.
Uh, so that usability that comes with that insider expertise is another big competitive advantage. The company&#39;s weakness is size. You know, we.
Umm, and being, uh, New York to the market with other companies being around for 30, 20, 30 years. Some of the opportunities that are happening in medical education is, Um, organizations are moving towards competency-based education model, which requires a lot more data.
This requires software-like metrics to implement. Um, eh, that needs to be implemented across all areas of training. So, for example, if a medical school wants to move to, towards the competency-based model, they have to have all of their students in one platform.
Which is, they&#39;re realizing that their existing platforms are not meant to be used, uh, um, as an all-in-one solution. Metrics is coming in and allowing them to consolidate their workflows into one system.
Another, uh, opportunity in the market is internationally more organizations that are understanding the importance of having technology, and we&#39;re having new institutions adopt metrics.
Um, especially since the United States Learning Model is standard. And it&#39;s being, uh, serving as a model for other institutions across the world.
So that means everything that we build in the United States is also something that other countries can use to train their physicians and nurses.
Um, another. Companies, uh, one of the strengths is, uh, the founder being a physician, which allows us to, um, continuously build new functionality that&#39;s, that&#39;s, uh, aligns with the, with the changing needs of the market.
And this is something that&#39;s unique to, uh, metrics compared to other products and companies in the market. One more, uh, strength is metrics also focuses on hiring team members that have experience in medical education to have insider experience and have that build up that domain expertise.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/79a5df31360849faa2f2529fabdc11aa</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Approval Status Enhancement Discussion</pre></td><td><pre>Okay, so, the ability to add additional approval statuses. So on, when you generate an MSPE, uhm, there&#39;s also a way to, you choose the cohort, and, uhm, if I want to change the status, you can choose these statuses, this is hardcoded, so what we want to do is give them a setting.
So we talked, so we talked about MSPE set, like, uhm, essentially in the gradebook, we can have an MSPE settings page, uhm, and that&#39;s where we can do the import cron that we talked about earlier, but you can also have another setting where you say approval statuses and let them create additional ones
. So they want to have a Dean number one approve it, Dean number two approve it, so they can just basically use Add to the list and then while I&#39;m here, I also think that this is something that, Mike, you can do that when you have time, just play around with this page, it&#39;s clunky as f***.
For example, if I go in here, and I want to search for a group, and I find a group, and I, edit a document, then I go back to that document, uhm, like, save it, and go back to the document.
It also asked me for my status. Now the whole page is, like, refreshed. I gotta go through a selection of, like, I think it just needs a UX review of what else we can do to clean this up.
Uhm, I&#39;m not, it&#39;s not, this is not on here. Uhm, but I think, uhm, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not a priority, but, like, it would be nice for us to, when we would do one of these tasks, to also think about that page to just, because it&#39;s yours.
The issue is the steps that you feel like needs, needs to happen like, or, just uh, it says, Yeah, OK, so you&#39;re saying everything, it&#39;s like clear out.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean that&#39;s, uh, I, you know. I&#39;m just polishing it up. This was designed by David. It was a back-end developer.
And then, I think you can probably actually use off canvas to load the document for editing. So you can just keep going, because they&#39;re looking at hundreds of these ones, and going back and forth.
Um. Yeah. I&#39;m gonna just put this here at the bottom.
Um. Hey kid, user friendly, EX, use off canvas to edit.
it. You&#39;ve, uhm, generated. And you can, uh, use the MSPE, the metricslab.com. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then for Shukhi&#39;s knowledge, when I say off canvas, this is a bootstrap plugin where, It opens up, instead of, there&#39;s models, and then, yeah, it&#39;s basically half the screen, and it&#39;s meant to be, like
, page overlaid on another page. So that way, just like this, you can just go to one document, close it, go to the next document, and it&#39;s easy to edit them.
Okay. Um. Alright. So, I&#39;m going to skip, uh, the rest of the MSBE, uh, once for now, because I want to, um, I want to talk about optimizer, and see you if we have time.
Um, so, optimizer has, is, if it is, uh, heavily dependent on data in metrics. And right now, the team is doing a lot of manual data manipulation, and it&#39;s leading to all these errors and problems.
Clients are doing the same thing, and this shit was a mess this LMU, and added thing is all three of them, they&#39;re very data minded individuals that, uh, they, they, they, they just, they did like to solve problems themselves.
And like, they&#39;re reinventing the wheel each time with the data. Which is not good because, and, and, and that&#39;s why also we need a project manager because it&#39;ll coordinate all of them to be.
Because Maria is digging into the data and she&#39;s coming up with a different approach than what Chris used last year because she doesn&#39;t have any documentation.
But all of this is happening because we have a shitty way to get data out of the system and they have to do this manually.
So how we can solve this is, um. So we&#39;ve got So lottery, um.
Yeah. So let&#39;s see.

There is also a employer drop-down, which shows a list of employers. The site field, the site record also has a code.
That is meant to be a unique code that cannot be a duplicate for other sites and is a required field.
It&#39;s also a, site description field.
Sites are classified as internal or external and that is a required field. With sites, we also have the ability to create custom site fields.
These are going to be short text, long text, multiple choice, or checklist questions. And we can create these questions, and they have the permission to be either editable, viewable by all users or only admins.
Sites also have the ability to add site leaders, and site leaders are meant to be other users in the system.
With a text field where you can capture the leadership, the title, and then So these users are selected and linked to this site with the title field.
We have a documents view, uhm, we have the ability to Forget about the documents for now.

I&#39;m not ready to go through this with the rest of the dev team yet, but since you&#39;ve been looking at the cursor, uhm, I&#39;ve been, this is what I&#39;ve been doing with it.
I, uh, let me see this. Let me close all these windows.
So this is now something that, uhm, I&#39;m expecting.
thing. Us to be doing all the time, but I&#39;m mainly thinking about from a process for refactoring.
Wow, look at that. All these windows. And where is my? So I started a. Reposit, I mean, a little project called metrics react after you had said we should consider.
using, uhm, a stack that is more compatible with AI. And then, I added, uhm, rewrite, I mean, right, I tend to think to write, uhm, use the AI to rewrite some of the m- models, um, which I won&#39;t go into today.
I-I want-I want to have a meeting with you, Augustin, Chris, and Rio next week, uh, that we can dive into this a little bit more.
Um, but from the front end standpoint, What I wanted to do was see if I can use cursor the way that I&#39;ve been using lovable, um, with their agent bold.
So, I enabled their, uh, their, uh, enable YOLO mode, and then that essentially allows the AI to write code and also install.
All different libraries and operate on its own. Um, because I don&#39;t have the expertise to install a lot of these, like, front-end packages, and I mean, I can do it, but- It takes me a lot of, like, troubleshooting to get it to work, but with this tool, I can just say, set up a virtual environment, then
install Vue 3, and and- and it and it sets that up. So once it did that, I started, um, asking it to- incorporate some of the things that I was doing in lovable, I just- basically copied and peaced the the code into this because I really like the way that you used to get hub integration to connect these
two. I- I didn&#39;t know how to do that, so I just copied and pasted it. Um, but once I got that working, so essentially what it did was, like, it added this left menu.
Um. And the top header. But then I was like, let me see if I can use it to, just like I&#39;ve been using, lovable, to build an interface.
So, try to build this scheduling interface. And. It&#39;s, it&#39;s working really well. And, um.
This is allowing me to experiment and prototype directly in, uh, cursor. sir. Umm, I, I&#39;m not trying to connect the front end and the back end.
I, I&#39;ve, I tried that for one, but it, it&#39;s just a mess. You know, I don&#39;t think it, it needs a lot of feedback.
But if I can, what I can do is create models on the back end side and. Just front end components with mock data.
So here&#39;s what I am thinking as a, a, um. A modified version of what you sent me. Yeah, I agree with everything you&#39;ve been saying here, and all of this, I agree, um, this has been, I mean, I don&#39;t know enough about all the technologies, but all of the tools that I found is going to- be best, uh, using
these stack. Um, so, here&#39;s, like, I think we should have, I think what are you describing driving here is going to be perfect for after the refactoring, when we are making improvements.
And this is going to be good for Mike and, um, Chris, Marina, I mean, uh, Maria, others to use, uh, level b- at the but I think for the refactoring, I&#39;m going to take the lead doing this myself and what I&#39;m, what I&#39;m leading towards doing is you You.
Me. Uh, um, Augustin, um, and Chris work on the refactoring while the rest of the team is working on the existing product.
product. And for the refactoring, it may be like, I&#39;m finding it relatively easy for me to use cursor to come up with a interface.
And once I have the interface, I can push the code for the front end and the back end models to a repository.
Oh, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s not it. Yeah, anyway, I can push it to a repository. library where you can pull that in and look at the code and use it to create the file.
The final versions that you want to use for the master or the production use cases of my repository would essentially be as a, um, draft.
Version. And what we want it, like, I&#39;m not going to be looking to see if there&#39;s any duplication of the components or anything that I&#39;m just going to be focused only on the UX and trying to keep it consistent with our existing back.
Because we want to maintain all of the functionality that we have and not use this opportunity to add new functionality, but we just want to clean up the models so that the data is organized better.
Um, so if I can. Keep doing what I&#39;m doing here. And push it to a repository. You pull it to take the components, rework it, and integrate it into the final version.
Augustin pulls in the back-end code, goes through it with Chris for making sure that the black-end models captured everything we have.
And he also makes the final versions based on that. Then, Umm, ehm, ehm, and then he can also add on any, ehm, API, uh, build out any APIs that we need.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/74957d351751476aa94ab50a13e52645</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Calendar, Resources, Rotations, Projects, and Notifications</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Ed, figured it would be easier to run through this in a video. So the first thing, uh, calendar, we&#39;re focused on your M3 and M4.
Uhm, you still need the calendar module. And the reason why is because the calendar brings everything together. In Metrix, we do have separate modules that can be used.
For building out the session schedules for the preclinical. Then we have our block schedules for the clinical schedules. And students can go there and look at it.
But it&#39;s a calendar that allows all of that to come together on one calendar view. And then it also allows syncing.
So it of these calendar events outside of metrics to Google, Outlook, and so on. So it&#39;s one of those base modules, like the users module, or that, that, uh, kind of connects the rest of the, uh, system together.
For resources, think of it more like a file management system that&#39;s built into the system, a file management system that&#39;s built into the platform.
And what you can do is create folders and set permissions for those folders so that different users can access handbooks.
guides and other, uhm, files. For rotations, there&#39;s also a standardized folder structure called rotation resources that lets the school put in documents in there.
Metrics can then deliver those documents to your students based on their schedule. If I&#39;m starting at a card game, the audio rotation two days from now, I may get an email saying these are the goals and objectives for this rotation.
This is something that if it&#39;s set up, it can go out X days before each rotation based on that rule that you set up, uh, in, in, in the platform.
Um, if you want to track compliance, it&#39;s just is handled through our documents and requirements module. Documents allow you to create documents as well as track all types of paperwork in the platform.
The requirements module is essentially a way to assign different requirements and different tasks for those documents. So, for example, if you have a medical license or CV that you want the preceptor to submit, you may create a requirement asking, uh, the users to submit those and then assign it to the
preceptors. when those individuals get an impact. And then, depending on treatment they need, you may have to request that the preceptor and the documents module allow every one of the organizations to see what was submitted for each preceptor.
You can also give permission for those documents reviewed by external users. And as time goes on, as these things expire, you also get alerts when documents are- expired, and there&#39;s a way to also automatically generate a requirement based on an expiring document.
For projects, umm. So, essentially, projects is something that we build for the sake of tracking working. Quality improvement projects or research projects in metrics.
Yes, they can use an external project management tool. Umm. But the nice thing about putting it into metrics is everyone is logging into metrics and projects module allow everyone in the organization to see what&#39;s happening.
So. If someone is working on a research project or a quality improvement project that another student or faculty is interested in, they can go into it and see who&#39;s working on it and contact them.
Second use case for this is umm, um, committees. If you have a committee that is responsible for some sort of operational process, accreditation.
They can be put into a, a project and it can be made as a private project whether using it to manage tasks and comments.
So it is a generic tool. Um, and the benefit of doing it in metrics will be to have it centralized where everyone that is part of the organization can.
And see it if it needs to be visible. If, uhm, if not, it can be made private. You can work with the other colleagues to, uhm, uhm, assign tasks to them.
So this is not required. Metrics includes built-in notifications. For all of our modules. So you can send, uh, Metrics will send out reminders for completing certain tasks.
Uhm, let&#39;s say just completing evaluation, requirement, case log, and so on. The advanced one for, uh, is only needed to put in specific business rules.
So if your school has- some sort of escalation process that if a evaluation is not completed in, let&#39;s say, 90 days, notify the dean.
Or evaluation is not completed in, uh, uh, 180 days, uh, e-mail the CEO. So this lets you create, Umm, various rules based on the evaluations or different, uh, curriculum dates.
And if there is another use case and you anyone have some sort of custom rule built into the platform, that&#39;s where the outbound module comes into play.
I would recommend, I don&#39;t know if we, uh, I can&#39;t recall if we included this. Um, we can start with, without it.
And then if you feel like you need more notifications, what&#39;s come standard with the system and you want to add custom ones, then you can always add this back on.
Add this back on. Um, so the B.I. Um, intelligence, the support for the platform is included. Uh, but for the Business Intelligence Server, it is a separate add-on.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/b26cd4e989414f02b1fecf2f2319baef</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Gradebook Review- 25 March 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hello everyone, wanted to share this brief video going over metrics great book and how the face sheets from The medical school had can be replaced using the great book Noel was kind enough to share the recording Requirements that the students have for the clerkships and the electives and I created some
data here To show you how the system works. So the first thing is on the great book We would define all of the different cores and electives that are offered.
You can even break this up into subcategories of different types of electives. This will show the number of weeks that are required and how many total weeks are required for that category.
That&#39;s something that we do as part of the basic system. For the gradebook itself, there&#39;s also a secondary setup where we can define the requirements for each course.
So you can see here, these are some of the requirements that are that Noel had shared with me, 20 case logs for the pediatric rotation, 20 case logs for the emergency medicine elective, canvas module, comment score, oral case presentation, preceptor evaluation and so on.
You can see that it does allow you to also define the maximum number of points if you need that. If you don&#39;t need it, you can set it to one and use it as a a whether it&#39;s completed or pass fail.
Once we have defined the score type, we can also define the score statuses, whether it&#39;s completed, pass, fail. Then we can start adding grades.
So you can see here, I have a student and I started adding some grades for the pediatrics course, for pediatrics rotation.
It shows a date and what has been completed. To add a score, I simply go and select a person and what rotation it is.
And it automatically shows what she was scheduled to. And uh, we need to enter a score. We can enter it, what we&#39;re submitting, status completed, and then save it.
Then the students will be able to see these statuses. on their end. So let&#39;s log in as a student here, Meredith, and this is the student&#39;s dashboard and they I&#39;ve got a great book.
And they can see the three scores that were published to me and it shows that case logs are completed, canvas modules completed, and so on.
And the one grade that we had entered that we didn&#39;t publish won&#39;t show up for the person. We also have the ability to filter for the courses and rotations at the top.
Preclinical courses show up here and rotation grades show up here. So with this gradebook setup, we&#39;ll be able to add all of those requirements into Metrix and then administrators will be able to update it so that students can see the statuses in real time.
We&#39;re also adding a way to import this data using a spreadsheet. So if you need to do a bulk upload of the grades and what was completed, you&#39;ll be able to do that.
Please let me know if you have any questions.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/620e58e1b81141bf91501f8f84393cf3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Demo Server – UME – Medtrics - 31 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>I&#39;m gonna send you a invite to this portal. This is a tool that I&#39;m testing out to see if we can use it for customer onboarding.
And essentially have something that Katie will manage when she&#39;s full-time and managing onboarding projects. So for that, what I. Wanted to uhm do was I created a list of things in here that we need it would we would need to set up I didn&#39;t add all the details in here.
Umm what I want to do is sort of work with you where you have access to it like a client and what I would like you to do is in between sales work umm any any time we don&#39;t have any sales work to do go into that server that you&#39;re using to set up this fake data or mock data and start thinking about what
information we need to add you can use chat GPT to generate the information and then based on that you&#39;ll be able to come up with like things that we need to put into here as list of things that need to be configured and you and I can talk about it on Slack and then umm this way it&#39;s sort of an iterative
process that you&#39;re leading using this outline and because for me to map everything out in it&#39;s gonna be very difficult for with my time but if you&#39;re able to kind of drive this from your end and think about from my clinical like for example clinical skill I already designated made it.
What are the separate tasks that we had to complete? This will allow us to test out this portal and for me, for you to also help create this sub-task.
So we can start with the I&#39;m gonna add you&#39;re not gonna be able to edit this because I want to test it out as if you&#39;re a customer and I&#39;m gonna be the the onboarding lead from the company and you&#39;re going to be able to go in here and mark things as complete as it done and then we&#39;ll go through it together
when we get to a section that we don&#39;t have subtasks you can think of what tasks need to be in there and then I can add that here and then you can complete that section.
So this would allow us to build this that we can use with other customers test out this platform and also have that server set up.
So essentially we&#39;re doing multiple things for the company that that will allow us to reuse this in the future. Umm.
Okay.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/6c375ac07a4b4efc8c2da3133ad43097</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Transcript Highlights - Google Docs - 11 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>So to create these notes, what I did was I opened up each of the transcripts and copied down the sections where the client or the prospect is speaking.
So I didn&#39;t really need what I said because I already had what I said. Instead, I pulled out everything that they said and I&#39;m going through it and writing notes into the appropriate section.
And for most of these, I&#39;m also trying to highlight specific challenges. When I&#39;m asking certain questions, I&#39;m driving them toward certain things that I want to highlight.
So when I&#39;m trying to take notes here, try to list out the challenges they had and then also write out any processes.
So right now I&#39;m working on the clinical section here. So here, how do you know who the student is working with?
I asked that question. Yes, we have another platform where the coordinators are telling us who they work with and they know in advance.
Who they were, who the students are being paired with when they go to a different hospital. So the first thing is making note of that and then we currently don&#39;t know how they&#39;re communicating this.
So I&#39;m going to write a question there. Actually it says right here it&#39;s email. X sends an email saying attendings.
C are covering then evaluations are assigned by the clinical team in eValue. Using that information. So a potential opportunity here is if we give them if we give these site coordinates access to metrics, they can make those assignments themselves.
Okay. I would say the challenge is that last minute changes. So again, this would they&#39;re saying when there&#39;s last minute schedule change, you have to make sure that we know that the evaluation who&#39;s on that rotation is accurate before they complete it.
So that&#39;s the biggest challenge they&#39;re facing. Uhm? I&#39;ll write that here. Well, that&#39;s the biggest challenge they&#39;re describing, but all the email back and forth is also.
Time consuming. Something&#39;s at the front door. Yeah. Yeah.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/7a69f590e3354c5d82c453cd320931dd</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Video Message: Improving Dashboard Design</pre></td><td><pre>So if we go this is the client dashboard and you can access it using this slash health slash dashboard And then when you come in here there is Basically a whole bunch of these stats that we try to track.
Students with no exams, residents with no exams and so on. I think this first loads all the different stats. This creates thresholds but I think first thing that we have to do is kind of move this into a separate like settings page or something we can have like a settings page and on this because that
should be the first thing that people see like yeah like this is like you need to tweak it they can go there yeah because it should be the live stats they should land on and then if I turn on all these yeah so what&#39;s what&#39;s kind of annoying here is the fact that you have to do this one by one oh okay
uhm you think violations should be in a section like a drop down and then select the whole that&#39;s like time offs should be together uhm does that not uhm group them in some way in the drop down I mean select all would be nice first of all yeah that&#39;s a lot of data maybe we can come up with headings that
things would fall under yeah I think that would be a better way to do it is if we instead of showing it we can have tabs under here so that there is no drop down you just basically have programs and tabs the tabs can be for different like users caselogs all this is caselog stuff work hours evaluations
schedules and other basically uhm so if I have let&#39;s see I&#39;m thinking uhm so we have programs and then and then if I click that I was wondering if you had a drop down that would come from that and then you would select on the ones that you wanted that fell underneath evaluations like almost like a would
that be a drop down and you know. I was thinking that. Select the ones that you want and then it populates.
Yeah uhm. Yeah, I have no idea what&#39;s the best to hear but let&#39;s say if I Choose evaluations and then I would That would show up on that one right and then if I click this then it&#39;ll show all the ones for case logs Okay, and then simultaneously you&#39;re saying that that would no click on that and this
disappears. Yeah, it disappears in the other way Because otherwise you don&#39;t know how it went up with yeah yeah so youre kind of saying show me the stats for evaluation show me the stats for case logs yeah uhm and then this would kind of stay static and you dont need to click all this one each time its
kind of just going to the dashboard clicking through what you need uhm and then the other thing that we would do is you could have like an export of this yeah you can do an ex uhm export print page or here it would be it would highlight yeah that we&#39;re not good things that are in the green so yeah I
think that actually works really well so it would essentially eliminate this whole thing and get rid of all the clicks and the only and I think it&#39;s easy to look through this and kind of say users uhm Case logs, this is time off, but I think we can put users and time off together, uhm case logs, work
hours, and then yeah All right. calendar and events yeah calendar and events uhm evaluations and then schedule uhm yeah actually let&#39;s just keep yeah we can keep it kinda to the left menu whatever we have there it&#39;ll match it so users you can put benefits ok that way we&#39;re we&#39;re keeping consistent with
our language alright then uhm so all you the admins all they would do is come here click one then go to the next one next one and they can and if you if its too many tabs we could even say load you can even turn this into a drop down that only lists out uhm the modules okay and you click on the ones
that you want yeah and then it&#39;ll well you would show I think we should show one at a time because if we show multiple one it&#39;s gonna be too much okay so let&#39;s lets try the tabs it might be fine to fit that many tabs on there yeah and then historical stats here this is meant to show users that never
logged in in the past and I think what we need to do here is not show historical stats like this uhm like the table is best as like charts.
Okay. You know, show some sort of ah. Some sort of line graph. Yeah. So how this is uhm. I could probably take a screen shot from that other dashboard that Rio had.
Yeah Find some line graph I also will go through this at some point and make it more selective because I don&#39;t think having users who never logged in and history of all that what&#39;s that gonna there&#39;s nothing theyre gonna do with it.
Yeah its very its like covering every base ever now and then. Yeah uhm I mean that might be helpful for maybe theres stuff thats helpful for us and then stuff thats helpful for the client.
Yeah historical students with no exams residents with no exams this is like collecting data for the sake of collecting data theres like uhm then we have thresholds so this is meant to trigger notifications so if i can say for this particular specialty users never logged in if it&#39;s greater than one for
30 days then it will it will send an email notification we don&#39;t have the email notifications built yet but that&#39;s the purpose of this so I think so the threshold actually is a trigger to send an email yeah so I think what we need to do here is change this design so by default when you arrive on this
page we&#39;re showing all the thresholds and I shouldn&#39;t have to select a program I should just see all the all the uhm all the thresholds and then which programs it applies to uhm because right now it&#39;s way too much data if you have 50 programs I have to choose one by one like what this is like a back
end developers dream here like everything can be customized everything can be very specific and granular but do you really think they&#39;re gonna go through every single program and set thresholds for every single yeah you have an administrator that wants to look at the big picture yeah so so I think let&#39;s
start with this page and do the tab thing yeah and then once we have that then we need to worry about the thresholds later thresholds ok so but I just for the completeness sake thresholds allow you to say whats the criteria youre tracking and if it triggers an event lets say someone didnt do evaluations
for 5 days and that was a threshold then we capture that in the threshold events ok so it means that that trigger was hit ok so an administrator can come in here and look through it and see what alerts was met ok so i know we talked about email but are some of those alerts gonna be like on their dashboard
or eventually yeah yeah ok yeah alright yeah just so what while you&#39;re focusing on the design what I&#39;m gonna focus on is looking through these lists of things and pick what&#39;s actually useful right same with yeah yeah any too much</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e42727ee76384eb8867e4ba37f90200d</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Building Systems for Personal and Business Growth</pre></td><td><pre>This year&#39;s theme focused on building systems for personal and business growth. As Metrix starts to scale and accelerate its growth, its its becoming performing performing at your peak and a job especially in a startup requires that we each take care of our own self including our mental mental clarity
mental mental health mental clarity and physical health like a athletic team performance meh taking care of our like an athletic team taking care of ourselves off the field field allows us to perform our best on the field each of us at Metrix are relying on each other one another to come through when
we need help and Each of us need us to come through when we need help and in order for us to be there We have to take care of ourselves.
So today this week this retreat focus a lot on under mindfulness getting ours ourselves mentally ready and prepared for whatever comes our way as the company grows and as the days progress</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/712aa8b7dde444acb1e02c2f0309e376</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Personal Growth Challenge</pre></td><td><pre>Good evening everyone. I wanted to create this short video to explain our Metrix personal growth challenge Essentially, this is a month-long challenge where we are trying to do one personal challenge every day And we each will pick, we can each pick whatever you want to do And the goal is we have to
do that habit, behavior, or activity And then share an update in one of the Slack channels we have set up So I&#39;m going to go through the uhm the reasons behind it, some tips and also show you the channel and the tracking sheet that we have set up First, why?
Uhm the reason that I wanted us to have this 30 day challenge especially at the start of this year is so that we can focus not only on our work and how we are progressing and growing as a company but also focus on ourselves and our mental health and physical health cause that plays a big role in how
successful we are at our careers and as a company we&#39;re a startup that is scaling and growing we want to make sure that all of our team members are also growing both at work and outside of work so thats the reason that we want to have this challenge and the goal is that by the end of the 30 days we have
developed a new habit that we can keep going with it and then maybe we have other challenges down the road that we can take on for other habits that we want to build so again commit to doing one habit slash behavior activity for 30 days share updates in the improve daily channel keep track of the team
progress on the dashboard and then check in on team members and motivate them to keep up with their goals this is important because there are some cash prizes associated with this and some of those prizes are going to be if we make it through the challenge as a team so the first thing that I will have
here is when we are creating this challenge the reason that we&#39;re doing this as a team is so that we can make a commitment share it with our team and then support each other along the way this increases the probability that we achieve our goal and again this is ideally something that gets us out of our
comfort zone for some of us, simply sharing some of our personal activities and what we&#39;re doing that alone gets us out of our comfort zone and then as we go through the month we kind of get comfortable with this new habit uhm and then start to learn how to work that habit into our daily routine and
then eventually scale up from there with this new behavior and continue improving our personal life. Why 30 days? It&#39;s long enough for us to make a commitment that it&#39;s gonna last while short enough for us to make it uhm see it as an achievable goal.
You know for for me I can think of it as if I want to do something for 30 days I see the end in sight and its more realistic for me to commit to it than to say I&#39;m gonna do something for a year but if I make it to the 30 days I will I may already have that worked into my routine that I will keep doing
it for the rest of the year. When we pick our goal we also want to be realistic with all of the other commitments that we have in our lives and start with something that is easy to do you know aim for something that will take 30 minutes or less and break it up into smaller steps if you want to for example
in the book a time make habits uhm they talk about how if you want to start working out everyday maybe the first step that we do for a few days is to simply go into the gym for a few minutes and then after you have the habit of going into the gym the first for another few days you maybe you pick up a
dumbbell uhm then you kind of building that up so that you&#39;re building a new habit and growing from there. And the other thing that we want to keep in mind is when we&#39;re trying to build a new habit it&#39;s always uhm hard to be perfect you know do not aim for perfection it&#39;s always best to aim for consistency
so one day you didn&#39;t get to do it for whatever reason try to make sure that you don&#39;t make it the next day and if you know even if youre not able to go for your full strength if youre working out or doing something uhm the fact that you did it counts so as long as youre consistently doing something
even if its not uhm your full effort its ok. Our goal here is to build a habit not necessarily go hardcore for a few days and then get burnt out.
I love this image because when you&#39;re looking at something and it seems like a really crappy day and you didn&#39;t get to do what you need to make sure that you look at everything else that you have accomplished and if you made it through a tough day its ok if you didnt get to your goal but make sure that
you appreciate any progress and try to try to make sure that you keep up that with that consistency so dont let a bad day or a meh missing a goal keep you from finishing it for the end of the for the full 30 days.
So that leads us to our prizes. Essentially our goal is to hit ah our goal is to hit whatever Activity you set out for yourself for all 30 days without missing two days in a row if you do that, you will earn 25 per week Then the other goal is to make sure your team is also doing it So we&#39;re gonna essentially
have two teams One on the essentially the business side The other one on the dev team And if you if both teams are able to make it through the goal and and support each other in getting through the 30 days Uhm they&#39;ll also get an extra $25 So from the business side essentially we have to keep each other
accountable The devs have to keep each other themselves accountable with among the devs Uhm and again the team bonus is all or nothing We all have to make it One thing that I want to add here is the days that you are not If for some reason you&#39;re not able to Work out or do whatever whatever you need
to if you post to the channel Something that you&#39;re thankful for this is something that we started doing on the Business side recently if you post something a daily gratitude to that channel it counts towards a goal So that&#39;s still a way for you to make sure you&#39;re not missing your 100 days so if we
all hit our goals that will be extra $200 for each team member at the end of the month So let me show you the channel here you can Thank you.
See that. My workout and I shared an image of the at the end of that workout. And you don&#39;t have to update the tracking sheet, this is something that we&#39;ll do on a weekly basis, you simply have to post something to that channel.
Let me show you what the tracking sheet looks like So here we have uhm Team member, personal challenge, why am I making this commitment, accountability partner, and then whether we did it or not.
And I will be adding a section here as team 1 and team 2 this way each team can hold the other team members accountable and then the accountability partners is essentially someone else that you&#39;re partnering with to hold you accountable.
So that&#39;s everything about our new challenge and I want to thank you for participating. I&#39;m very excited about this because I think this is going to be a good experience for everyone.
For our team, we already do such a good job with the product and all the stuff that we do at the business, this is a good way for us to do things outside of business and get to know each other better and also to grow our uhm uhm ourselves and do something that we haven&#39;t done in a while so many of the
team members who signed up for this already uhm you know the first thing they started off I used to do something but I haven&#39;t had a chance to do it in a while so this is an opportunity to get back into that.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/56503e422d714b1b81e69876e12cf921</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>AT Still University SOM in Arizona Medtrics Proposal - PandaDoc - 17 January 2024</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Christina Wanted to create this short video so that you have a good understanding of what&#39;s covered in this proposal This is something that we&#39;re putting together as a preliminary estimate and it includes all of our modules So you can kind of treat this as the upper limit of what the cost would be
If we, if you are to purchase all modules Typically institutions are picking out the modules that they need And then Creating a custom package And this is this can be done based on your short-term goals and your long-term goals You can start with some of the modules then scale up to other modules as
needed So in the beginning we we provide includes all support that is necessary. Needed to maintain it. So anytime you have a question or one of your fact of administrators have a question, they can reach us directly through a live chat, a phone, a phone call or an email and.
Reach directly to our team in Philly. This allows them to ask questions and also get real-time responses if they&#39;re in the platform.
We also provide training during our onboarding process so our onboarding is done at as weekly meetings for a month, for about three months.
So for example if youre implementing our clerkship modules, were gonna have a series of meetings for three months and each week we meet for thirty minutes and that includes some implementation and training.
After onboarding is done there&#39;s on demand training that can be scheduled and this allows your team to get more one on one training when you need it and there&#39;s no additional cost for that.
These articles are also included for all of the modules, this includes short videos that show you how to do things in the system.
And then all modules in the system you receive continuous updates, we&#39;re typically pushing out new features and updates. Once a month so that&#39;s all included and you receive emails or you can join our monthly webinar to learn more about it here&#39;s a list of our modules there&#39;s two sections here first is
our standard modules that is based on the number of students and its student licensing and down here we have our stand alone modules that is meant to be purchased as a flat rate for each of them and can be used by all the modules I mean all the students then there&#39;s some additional services that we offer
optimizers for automatically generating schedules for the students, staging servers for your IT department to build custom integrations, data warehousing for IT if you need to sync any sort of ah data with your internal data warehouse, uhm integration.
Integrations to build integrations with uhm with uhm other software systems knowledge base excuse me I already mentioned and then customer success we do quarterly check-in with your team to make sure that we&#39;re meeting the goals and if there&#39;s anything else that we need to do uhm to optimize our uhm
our services so that happens with our customer success team every quarter and in terms of metrics led implementation uhm this is what we&#39;re recommending if we were to buy the full system thats 9 months of weekly meetings and this is essentially covering different projects such as curriculum implementation
, MSPE implementation, clerkship implementation and uhm each meeting is 30 minutes but we also take about 30 minutes of prep time so you can think of each week is using up one of these hours uhm so we 75 hours that typically includes those weekly one hour commitments for meetings and then any sort of
additional work we have to do outside of it to set up the system. List of the different modules as I mentioned everything is included here except for lottery uhm for the modules and then optimization service is something that is custom for schools that need it and data warehousing if your IT department
needs it you can we can include that so all of the modules that are typically offered for medical schools is included uhm so I should clarify what I said initially uhm there are some additional things you can add on but what we include what the team included is everything that is necessary for a medical
school to get up and running and there&#39;s some nice to have features that can be added if necessary and this is our support details we have 8am to 8pm eastern time live chat email phone and then in terms of our data policy we don&#39;t claim ownership to any of your data it&#39;s entirely owned by your university
and if for any reason you decide that metrics is not a good fit we we remove everything and send you a copy so that its intellectual property and everything that is created by the school is owned by the school and here we get to the pricing here this is a list of the different modules and then the per
module pricing and the number of licenses for 600 students and then the total down here these are our stand alone modules modules essentially if you&#39;re buying curriculum by itself it doesn&#39;t matter how many students because it&#39;s typically used for administrators if the school just buys the curriculum
module but once you start to delivering the curriculum to the students using the schedules then youre gonna start using the student facing modules up here for the schedules and the same thing for the MSPE generators here too implementation hours here and this is the total for all modules with 75 hours
of implementation time this will be the recommended package if you&#39;re gonna implement metrics for all 4 years if if after we discuss everything and you say these are the prior what are the priorities for the department we can create a custom package that includes the modules that you need and then and
then as additional processes can is are consolidated so for example there are 2 common pathways that medical modules take 1 is either start with the curriculum module then expand from there or start with the clinical operations and then expand to the preclinical afterwards so depending on what your prior
what your team&#39;s priority is we can customize this for proposal so I hope this helps and I look forward to continuing our discussion.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/c79dfed08ca54fe0af7860d3da05949e</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics Personal Growth Challenge</pre></td><td><pre>Good evening everyone.

Activity you set out for yourself for all 30 days without missing two days in a row if you do that, you will earn 25 per week Then the other goal is to make sure your team is also doing it So we&#39;re gonna essentially have two teams One on the essentially the business side the other one on the
dev team And if you if both teams are able to make it through the goal and and support each other in getting through the 30 days they&#39;ll also get an extra $25 So from the business side essentially we have to keep each other accountable The devs have to keep each other themselves accountable with among
the devs and again the team bonus is all or nothing We all have to make it One thing that I want to add here is the days that you are not If for some reason you&#39;re not able to Work out or do whatever whatever you need to if you post to the channel Something that youre thankful for This is something that
we started doing On the business side recently If you post something A daily gratitude to that channel It counts towards a goal So thats still a way for you to Make sure youre not missing your days So if we all hit our goals That&#39;ll be an extra $200 for each team member At the end of the month So let
me show you the channel here you can see that there&#39;s a daily check in that post and if you respond you can either reply to it into the thread if you or you can simply go in here and paste it as a text message or an image so i did a my workout and i shared an image of the at the end of that workout and
you don&#39;t have to update the tracking sheet this is something that we&#39;ll do on a weekly basis you simply have to post something to that channel let me show you what the tracking sheet looks like so here we have uhm team member, personal challenge, why am I making this commitment, accountability partner
, and then whether we did it or not and I will be adding as a section here as team one and team two this way each team can hold the other team members accountable and then the accountability partners is essentially someone else that you&#39;re partnering with to hold you accountable.
So thats everything about our new challenge and I want to thank you for participating. Im very excited about this because I think this is going to be a good experience for our team.
We already do such a good job with the product and all the stuff that we do at the business. This is a good way for us to do things outside of business and get to know each other better and also to grow our our ourselves and do something that we haven&#39;t done in a while So many of the team members who
signed up for this already you know the first thing they started off I used to do something but I haven&#39;t had a chance to do it in a while so this is an opportunity to get back to that habit something that made you happy</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/49185425688949b780093477f968ca77</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Attention | Conversations - All Calls - 29 November 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Alejandro. I wanted to get your help on a couple things for a project. In attention, if you go into the the conversation page, and clear out, and the filters, clear out all the filters, and come down to we have, we&#39;re gonna have, it says that you have 300 calls in here.
I&#39;d like you to find all the ones that are sales meetings, and the best way to do that is the ones that are labeled demo.
So. Let&#39;s say let me see if I can I think I might be able to search here. Okay, so we got 19 calls here to start with and what we need to do is if you click on one of these.
And go to transcript what I want what I need to do is copy and paste the the piece into Google Doc.
So in a Google document or we can actually start a Google folder and for each of these presentations highlight the text.
So it&#39;ll be highlight all of it, copy it, and then paste it into a Google Doc and one other thing to paste at the bottom of this is for the insight them.
Or top track. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, and if we can copy the talk track and so let me let me show you what the example will be.
So if I go to drive and go to shared drives under Thank you. Sales assets and create a new folder transcripts.
And then create a file. Go to attention. Copy the name. That&#39;s the file name. Copy this. Looks like it&#39;s stuck.
So, control C to copy. And then, let&#39;s try pasting it. Paste without formatting. Seems to get stuck every time I try to paste here.
Okay, so let&#39;s try this. Copy. That&#39;s giving me problems. Let&#39;s try something else. Okay, so it pasted to a Word document here, so you may need to paste it outside.
Out of Google first. So once we paste it, we also want to take the, ah, Thank you. Talk track and put it at the bottom and then for.
Active listening. Let&#39;s put that at the bottom too. So essentially, those three things we want to copy for every Thank you.
Thank you. So once you copy it outside of Google, then it&#39;s easy to paste it in here. So for each of these demos, we want to copy the transcript, the active listening.
And again, so the first thing to do is clear out the name and then for title, put in the demo and that&#39;ll give you the 19 demo and we can copy those meeting.
Thank you. I think meeting is going to give a little too many. I can make a list of the ones that are in the meeting.
Yeah, so you can start with the demo ones, if you search for demo, and then I&#39;ll make a list of the meetings ones that we need to copy to.
Again, this is not a rushed project. You can do it maybe an hour each day and try to. You can get these copied and then it&#39;s going to help us create training materials for sales.
Thank you so much.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/a4379e2ea5c04decbcee7a8ddb8e0e33</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Updated graphics for emailing - santhosh@medtricslab.com - Medtrics Lab Mail</pre></td><td><pre>Hi, David hope you&#39;re doing well. I wanted to create this video to give you an update on what we&#39;ve been up to since, uh, we get got the pet project back up and running.
We were on a standstill for a while due to the pandemic, but in the last few months, things have gotten up and running and we have a couple of other faculty members that have joined us one from another radiologist, as well as a human computer interaction, a professor from George Mason university.
So it&#39;s four of us working on this now. And, uh, we decided that the best course of action is to apply for a grant and H grant.
This will allow us to focus on the research and then down the road, if we&#39;re able to create something successful, then work with temple to maybe commercialize it, uh, with the ultimate goal, being a product that can be, uh, implemented into clinical practice.
So this was the same, uh, concept that I had shared with you when we met. So the idea would be to try to take a radiology report, use AI and create a simplified version.
And the graphics are nice, but the more important things are simplified sentences that are created or ma uh, output through the system so that the patients are able to understand the main problem that they have.
And our goal is not to completely translate what the radiologist said, but simply to, uh, give them enough information, to know if something is urgent or whether something can wait until they speak to the doctor at their next visit.
Because a lot of times when the, they get the report, the patients get the report before they have a chance to speak to the doctor.
Then they&#39;re very anxious about what&#39;s in the report. So current workflow that we have is patients, um, see their doctor are an eye scan is recommended.
The scan is done, and the radiologist creates a report and the hospital&#39;s sensor report to the patient. And then they wait to go see the doctor and have that explained to them, uh, with the new report, the idea is to, um, take what we have now, or the radiologist creates build an interface that will send that information to an AI tool that will generate a simplified version.
Immediately sends it back to the radiologist who can then review the simplified version, approve it. And then the full report and the simplified version can be sent to the patient.
This is a complex problem that will take, you know, two or three years for us to solve. Um, so we&#39;re hopeful that this will be, uh, approved by the NIH.
Um, but the idea is the first step of this, to understand how big of a gap. So this is a, our grant application that we&#39;re working on.
The idea here is to first understand how big of a diff, uh, gap in communication is there between the radiologist and the patient, and whether we can properly quantify that that&#39;d be the first step.
And then once that&#39;s quantified, the next step is to create a library of simplified explanations for common pathologies that are identified in CT scans, CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
And then this will allow us to then create a tool. Actually, here&#39;s an, here&#39;s an example of that, where you have a simplified version and then your simplified version on the right side that the patient will read.
And then even for a normal explanation here, uh, patients may be confused. So our output will be simplified here. So the first step is to quantify the gap between the understanding of the patient and what the radiologist intended then, um, write so simplified versions for all of the common, uh, pathologies that we see.
And then, then use that, um, uh, written phrases to train an AI model, to generate simplified versions automatically. That&#39;s a second, uh, goal.
And then once that is created, then the third goal will be to integrate that back into a radiologist software so that the report is automatically generated and sent back to the radiologist.
So anyway, this is a long proposal and what I was hoping to do was, um, um, share this.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/f238bf75b86248e99a563078872bd642</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Summative Evaluations – Figma</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the review process for, Um, Of course, uh, Kirk clerks directors. Um, so on the left panel, we have this system set up and in that section, we have rotations full page and the rotation page allows us to create new rotations.
And when add rotation is created, we&#39;ll have a new section at the bottom that says rotation directors and administrators here, an individual can be selected.
And then that individual can be given permission to view evaluations for individuals scheduled to this rotation. So as the first setting that&#39;s turned on, and then on the template, when a evaluation template is created on the first page, we&#39;ll add this new section that explains that this template will be used for summative evaluations.
So this form will be used to collect feedback from individuals who are rotation directors or administrators. If the evaluator is also a rotation director or administrator with permission to view evaluation performance show all prior evaluations for the respect to rotation.
For example, if the rotation director for cardiology is completing this form, he or she will be shown a section at the top that lists out all prior evaluations for cardiology that the evaluator had.
So then evaluations will get assigned as normal, um, using our assignment rules and when a clerkship director gets their evaluations using that particular template system we&#39;ll know that they&#39;re also the rotation director or administrator using the setting on the rotation and displayed this section at the top.
This section will list out any evaluations that were assigned for cardiology since it&#39;s the cardiology rotation we&#39;re working with and the clerkship director can click view for them to see the, uh, actual submission, um, or if it&#39;s not completed yet, they can just see that it&#39;s, the status is open, but not completed.
And they click the copy answers to my form option if their form matches, or if there are questions on their form, matches the questions on the preceptors form, those answers will be copied below and everything else would work the same.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/e430dbc5b60a4539aa67c42660009b64</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics</pre></td><td><pre>So in this video, we&#39;ll take a look at the changes that we need to make for session schedule upload. So right now, when you are uploading a session schedule, it will replace a few of the fields, but not all of them.
Um, so if I look at this CSV file, This is actually an export that I got from, um, the curriculum export schedule.
So this is something that we created so that they can export the schedule, make changes in the pre uploaded back into metrics.
Um, so in here there&#39;s some bad data, so this needs to be deleted if it&#39;s secure using demo data. But the idea here is if the upload in contains is something with the same session code, then we have to replace every field in this CSP, um, when the upload happens.
So if they, if we have a, a and T one-on-one two Oh one already in the system, then we had to check every single column for that role and replace the data in metrics.
So that&#39;s not happening right now. So we need to make sure that we update that, including all the dates, um, groups and sessions and so on.
Then the other thing that we need to do is for the upload, we need to show a sweet alert at the top, right?
That shows, um, session schedule were uploaded successfully. And if there is an error, um, then we can show an error in a sweet alert that shows, um, roll number, whatever, uh, failed and, and, and stop the upload.
So success message. And if it fails, um, if we can easily show the role that it failed on, uh, that will be great.
If that is a more in-depth task to have that error, then we can do that as a follow-up task.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/56263fd6a3224b8cad7ad368281d5137</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Learner Management System - FINAL.docx - Google Docs - 6 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>How does the system archive data? What we want to highlight here is that we don&#39;t delete any of the students that you have added to the system.
So if you have a license for x number of students and they graduate, we simply deactivate their account or they simply re-deactivate their account and they&#39;re always going to be accessible for reporting.
The benefit of this is like each year they&#39;re only paying for their active licenses and but you have access to your historical data.
And you can do whatever you want with that. So there&#39;s a lot of value in collecting this data over multiple years and analyzing it.
We can say that we have seven years that we&#39;re putting into the timeline of after that we can have the right to delete it.
And it&#39;s based on the LCME. It&#39;s like how long this organization should store their records. So there&#39;s a second component to this that we can draw some examples here.
In the bit in the call they said how when you have a student that is there for like a medical school rotation in the third year and they come there for one month.
Then they come back for a fourth year for a second month. They are simply going to be reactivate that account and update the role.
And use the same account for the second rotation instead of having to create a whole new account. Then later on if they become a resident there, it&#39;s the same account that gets progressed.
So it&#39;s basically one account that each person gets that gets activated and deactivated. So essentially putting it on pause. Yeah.
And then they can restart it whenever they come back and it&#39;s still, all the data is still there. It just picks up where it left off.
Yeah. And then once they become an alumni, we change their role to alumni. And they have it accessed for indefinitely.
They won&#39;t be able to log in, but they can do all types of reporting. So we want to highlight how we do, so the strength of that is other systems do not allow you to advance like that.
They don&#39;t let you go from student to resident. So you have to have two accounts. We don&#39;t charge for those.
Alumni users and the fact that if you come back your account is there and you can reactivate it, that&#39;s a big plus because you don&#39;t have to go through that whole onboarding process again.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/85280fa0d4e34e62bb9925ed6ebd8756</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 7 February 2024</pre></td><td><pre>This first task is for us to update the review status drop down and the logic behind it. We have something, we have an option here for review completed by administrator.
And pending review by administrator, but this filter only includes the program administrators. However, we have permissions. We have permissions for other individuals besides the program administrator to post reviews.
So we have to change this so that uhm. Gotta change the logic so that. At all. Let me make sure I say this correctly, because for us to address all of the reviews and include make sure it&#39;s all included, we have to make it so that we&#39;re including.
Results that show reviews by anyone other than the evaluatee or the evaluator. So the assumption is if you have a review being posted, it&#39;s going to be either from the evaluator, evaluatee, or someone with administrative privileges.
Since there are different types of administrators now in Metrics, not just the program administrators. Essentially, what we&#39;re saying here is you can filter by evaluator, evaluatee, or anybody else.
So that logic would include anyone that completes from the personal portal with special permissions to review the evaluation or the program admin.
Same thing with this pending review by administrator. We&#39;re going to include any evaluation that is submitted. That has that that has only been reviewed.</pre></td><td><pre>https://www.loom.com/share/98fab0d4f95e4b1492cdeae1d394d737</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>success</pre></td><td><pre>Medtrics - 29 December 2023</pre></td><td><pre>Hi Karen, I love what you did here. These buttons are perfectly aligned and it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s ah, symmetric, and overall, it&#39;s looking good.
A couple things that I noticed is that when I&#39;m on the day umm when I clicked today it does go to today I wonder if there&#39;s a way that we can make this uhm either not show this button if you&#39;re on today or grade out grade out a little bit more because it looks like a button that I can click and its a
little confusing when I click on it nothing happens I know that at the top if you look at the date youll know that its today its itll uhm enhance the usability a little bit more if we can grade out maybe even use like uhm lets see how we show or i think we can even uhhm just show it as a selected button
as today if you&#39;re on today. That would make more sense to the user if you have the day and today highlighted in orange if you&#39;re on today.
So that&#39;s one item that I wanted to mention. The other umm was is on us doing the same thing for this here when there&#39;s no entries for this week and for violations, no violations found.
