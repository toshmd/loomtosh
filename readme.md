Adding Attachments to Announcements
Hi there, in this video we'll be going over adding attachments to announcements. So you do this while creating an announcement and as you might be aware there's two places to do this.
One is on your program admin dashboard. The other is on your program admin dashboard. So you do this while creating an announcement and as you might be aware there's two places on the actual announcements page and we'll go over both quickly here.
So in the process of creating a new announcement you'll have a section here for attach documents here and so you'll see there's a maximum file size limit of 10 megabytes but it does allow you to attach multiple files.
So you click on browse files here that's gonna open a Windows browser window or Apple browser window whatever operating system you might be using at which point you can select one or multiple files and then you can attach those to the announcement and that will be displayed both to users that are being
sent the announcement and viewing it on their dashboards in metrics as well as it will be attached to the email if you choose to send the announcement as an email.
You can also do this from the announcements page itself when you're creating a new announcement by going to new announcement and in the process is exactly the same here so no difference as just a different page to do it.
If you are managing quite a lot of announcements it might be easier to do it from the announcements page as opposed to the dashboard.

How to Set an Expiration Date for Announcements
Hi there. In this video, we'll be going over how to set an expiration date for an announcement, as well as going over what that actually means.
So there's basically two places you can do this. This one is when creating an announcement. So in this case, I'm creating an announcement from the dashboard.
And if we look at the bottom here under the setup delivery details option, there's a place to put an expiration date.
And so basically what that means is when we send a, announcement as a post, meaning that it shows up on people's dashboards, kind of like this as it shows up on ours, this is the date that that announcement will no longer be shown.
So there are some announcements that you might want to kind of keep there for a while or maybe even for the whole year, but then there are many announcements that are really only relevant for a, a little bit, like say, hey, there's this event coming up later this week, make sure to come or something
like that, but once the event is over that announcement really is not that useful anymore. So in cases like that, you can set an expiration date in order to get rid of that announcement from people's dashboards when they log into the system, so they're not looking at announcements that are no longer
relevant. And so that's how you do it when creating a new announcement from the dashboard page. You can also edit an existing announcement if it did not already have a expiration date and add it right here.
And then lastly, you can also, do this from the announcements page. So if you go to the announcements page to do this, you can create a new announcement.
And this is basically the same as on the dashboard, except it's located here. So you'll set an expiration date in much the same way that you would do on the dashboard.
And then you can, also edit older announcements here if for some reason they'd no longer show up on your dashboard.
You can hit edit, come here, and set an expiration date to remove it at that time from everyone's dashboard.

Creating and Sending Announcements on Metric Dashboard
Hi there! In this video we'll be going over how to create and send an announcement. And unlike most of our videos in this series, this is actually right on your dashboard.
There's a place to both view older announcements as well as create new ones. So you'll see right here on your dashboard, most likely where you'll be as an administrator when you first log into Metric.
We can see any past announcements that have been made here, and then we can make another one right from this page.
There's another place to basically do this as well, but more often than not you might as well do it from the dashboard.
But if you do want to create an announcement from the announcements page here, you can do that as well as review or delete or even resend older announcements that you've already made.
But we'll go ahead and do this first one from the dashboard itself. So a couple things you want to think about as you're making an announcement.
First is the subject slash title. So we do have the, the ability to send these announcements as emails. So whatever you put in here will be used as a subject line for that email.
So I'll just put an email subject line here. Then you have the text, the body of the announcement. And so you can put whatever it is you like in here and we do support various bits of form.
So I'm adding which will all come through whatever announcement you make both in the system as well as outside of the system in email.
So we'll just put some text here. Right? We have the ability to send documents along with this. So anything that you put on here will be accessible in metrics and it will also.
It'll be accessible through the email that is sent via the announcement. So I'll just add something here and you can add more than one if you like.
And then towards the bottom here, we start to get into who is actually going to get this announcement. So this is important to get right.
So let's say that. I want to inform my residents who will be PQA one, two or three. And these are the folks that will be getting my announcements.
So that means that whoever matches this criteria in the system will get it both on their dashboard when they log into the system and potentially via email based on what.
We can also use groups. So if there are any specific groups of people that don't match roles, but you've created them as a group, you can add them as a group and they will also.
Receive that email and lastly, any users that you want to add individually. So people that don't match to be each of my level, they don't match the group, but I still want them to get the eval.
You can add here as individuals. And then lastly, under setup delivery details, you can choose whether you want to send it only as a post, only as an email, or as both a post and an email, which is the default here.
And post means it's going to show up on their dashboard when they log in. And then lastly, you have an expiration date, and that's basically the date that the system will allow that post to be removed from their dashboard.
So if it's something that's only going to be relevant for the next couple of weeks, you can set an expiration date in the future.
And once we hit that date, this announcement will know. So we can send that announcement. You'll get a little pop up here that lets you know what's going to happen.
So in this case, this message will be sent to people that match the program internal medicine, the roles, PQI 1, 2, or 3.
And one individual carry Cox. So we can send that. It'll show up here, as you can see as a post.
And this will be displayed to users that match the criteria on their personal portal as well. And here's a quick preview of an email.
Now that would also be sent. So you could see the in the top, it's going to say example announcement. So that's your subject line that you put there.
It's also going to be tagged with from and then whoever sent it and the body of the announcement will look something like this along with any.
Files that are attached and at the bottom it will also show the person that sent the announcement.

What does the email for an announcment look like?
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about what our announcements actually look like when we email them to our users through metrics.
So to have a look at this, we'll just go to announcements on the left nav, and what we're going to do is we're just going to resend one of our earlier announcements, so we're going to resend this welcome to metrics.
Go to edit here, and the key with this is that whatever you make in this text field is pretty much how it's going to come through on the email, so feel free to utilize these kind of different tools here, different formatting tools, if you want to bold something.
I italicize something, make it a different font size, like all that different kind of stuff will translate to the email.
So I just did an example here with the bolding, I've added an image, you can also add video links here if you want to send folks a video, so I'm just going to go ahead and resend this as an email.
Then I'm going to switch my view here to a little internal tool, go look at an email that was sent, and you can see here, this is the basic layout for our email, so you'll see this use route at the header with your logo of your institution, footer here with some information about metrics, the text of
the actual announcement will go in the middle here along with whatever formatting you've applied images, videos, so on. At the bottom here it will show the user that sent the email.
We'll photo them as well as their name in case anyone needs to get in contact with them.

Viewing/Deleting older announcements
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about viewing and deleting older announcements. So as we've learned in other videos, announcements will show up on your dashboard until they are either deleted or they have met their expiration date, at which point they fall off of your dashboard as well as for
the those of your users. And at that point, if you want to retrieve them, say you want to edit it a little bit and then resend it again, maybe it's a kind of common announcement that you send at the start of an academic year or something like that, you could do that by going to the announcements tab
on the left nav and here you will see all of the prior announcements. So you can see here I have one earlier for welcome to metrics for the upcoming academic year.
So if I wanted to reuse that, I could click on edit here and we just see it's just a little an image here so I can click on edit here and then I would be able to also send it again.
So if we look at setting up the delivery details, right, I could resend this as a post or send it as an email and I can also set a new expiration date.
So in this case, I believe this one was still sitting on our dashboard, but we could set a later expiration date and send it again right now.
And so this is a good way for you to actually create new announcements from old ones. Right? So maybe just need to tweak for year to year so they can keep kind of like a low repository.
Of different announcements here. And if from time to time you do need to just get rid of some like, for example, ASD, ASD, we probably don't need that one.
We can just go ahead and delete and that will delete the announcement. It'll be hidden from view from everyone, of course, because it's gone.
And it also keeps this clean. If you are using the announcements feature a lot, you might end up with a lot of announcements here over the years.
So it might be useful to get rid of them from time to time.

How does a non admin user view announcements?
Hi there, in this video we're discussing what it looks like when you send an announcement to your users through metrics.
So quite simple here, I'm logged in as one of our students here and you can see I have a few other things on my dashboard, there's quite a few things on the student dashboard.
Depending on what you're doing in the system, this might look a little different depending Thank you very much. Depending on what modules you're utilizing, you can see we have an announcement down here and it pretty much comes in the same way that you see it as you're creating the announcement.
So you can see here who it's coming from and when it was sent and then you get to see this sent to part here which also highlights why I am seeing it.
So in this case, I'm seeing it because I'm part of the internal medicine program. My role is PGY2 and I also happen to be added to it individually.
That's my user here, John Dorian. And then at the bottom, what I have here is the subject line. So the subject line, just like when you're creating an email, this is the subject line of the announcement.
So that's always going to be shown on top here. And then the content of your announcement will appear below it.
And again, that is shown in pretty much the same exact way as when you created it under the announcements function.
So, ah, all the different formatting images, video links and stuff like that, ah, will continue to be shown in the same exact way as when you made it on the announcement.

What is "benefits"and what are benefit categories?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk a bit about benefits, what they are, what the categories are, and what they mean.
So in metrics, benefits primarily refers to time off, right? So an easy example of that is vacation time. People might have two weeks vacation time.
During the year that they're free to take whatever point as long as you go through an approval process. And that is what the benefits module is for.
It's for people requesting that time and getting that time approved by an admin and then making that information available for people to see, report on, so on.
So to understand that, though, you want to take a look at these categories. So to look at the categories, you want to be on the institution portal.
We'll go to benefits on the left nav, and that is currently just the time off module here. So you'll see at this particular demo institution, I have six total categories.
This is made up of the four. So that those are these four right here. These are defaults that will exist on every system.
And then we have these other ones, which are just custom ones that we've made. So a couple of things to note about the categories themselves.
There's not a whole lot of differences between how they work. They're just things, right? We have a category for vacation.
You can log time against vacation. We have a category for sick. You can log time against sick time, right? So that's really all that's for.
The one thing, that does make them a little different is this iris section here. So you can see there's two here included and excluded.
And so if you are working for a medical school nursing school, something like that, vet school, if you're using metrics, you don't have to think about this at all, really.
Cause there is no iris reporting through, for your program type, but if you are running a residency program, this becomes interesting.
And so this is a rule that says that you cannot claim time in your iris cost reports. For people when they are on conference.
That is excluded time. So our system needs to know when that time happens so we can create those those iris files appropriately using that information.
But that's, that's a one off. If you know what that even is, then you kind of know about it. You're in the iris world.
So I'm sure you have, you already know. But if you're not, you don't have to worry about that kind of thing.
And these are really just separate categories that people can log their benefit requests against. And you can make more if you need to, which we'll be covering in the very next video.

Making New Benefit Categories
Hi there. In this video we're talking about making new benefit categories. So in a previous video we talked about what benefits are, basically a way to log approved time off.
And so if we go from the institution portal, go to benefits on the left nav, click on time off here, we'll see a list of the different benefit categories that we currently have in the system.
So if we want, we can make more of these things. If it's worth it for us to categorize this time off differently, we can do that.
As mentioned in the previous video, these are the four base, I suppose you could say base or default categories, conference, leave of absence, sick, and vacation.
But we can also create new categories. A couple of things to consider as you make new categories. The first thing is, of course, do we even need it?
And this really comes down to are we doing some kind of reporting on this thing differently than just like regular vacation?
Is there a different kind of vacation? Do we need to log those that time differently some way for reporting? Or down the line?
So if the answer to that is yes, and it doesn't make sense to fit into the four default categories, then by all means, make some new categories.
So when you make these, you can choose what accounts it is usable with. So let's just say I'm going to make these.
I can make a custom category, I can give it some custom description, people can see that as they log it, but I can also decide what it's a subcategory for.
So it's, it needs to be a subcategory for one of these things, but it can also be a subcategory for multiple things if it makes sense.
So if I'm going to say this is a specific kind of sick, so this was a use case that we saw during COVID times, hopefully they don't make a return, but we saw some clients making separate categories specifically for tracking COVID time against their sick time.
So that's a good use case of where that makes sense. You can also by editing or creating the category, you can mark it active or inactive.
So if you need to mark the category as inactive, you can edit it and take the active status off. And this thing here is include in iris.
So this is self-explanatory a little bit. So if I include it, that means whatever time is used up by that request against the category, it's going to be included in the iris support.
If we turn that off, it's going to be excluded. So, you know, please refer to your GME office or iris or accounting professional that helps you deal with that for your specific use case.
But for example, SICK, you can include. It's considered part of that work. So that's the kind of thing you want to be aware of.
But in this case yeah, let's just go with that. So if we click submit, we have our new custom category and it's ready to be used by our users.
Of course, I would need to make it active. I did that. I guess I forgot to do that. But there we go.
That's how you activate and deactivate categories as well.

Creating document categories
Hi there. In this video we're going to be discussing creating document categories. So in order to create the document categories you must be on the institution portal, meaning you must have those institutional permissions.
Now if you're only having a program admin permissions then you can still utilize the document categories, but you cannot create or edit them.
So I'm going to create them. We're going to switch to our institution portal on the right side here. So click on institution.
We're going to go to system setup and then we're going to go to customize. So it's actually going to be the first tab under customize document type.
So these are the document categories. And making them is a pretty simple process, but there's a couple of things you could do with them that I want to explain here.
So if we click on new document type, you can see we've got a few different check boxes here. And so this will determine what kind of document it is and what kind of document it is. What kind of rules that we apply to it. So let's say, for example, we want to do only use this for sites and program documents
, not for personal documents, right? So anything that we make, so if we just say like, you know, document category so document category in this case, it's going to be personal.
Because we have not selected this checkbox. So that means it could be applied to users. However, if we select this checkbox, then it can only be applied to documents which are applied to programs or sites.
And so this is helpful to keep the document category list kind of limited based on your current use case. So, you know, you might be uploading various, like, ah, resident sharing agreements, ah, who knows what else for your sites.
And you don't want those document categories to be showing up when you're also adding documents to users because then you might add them incorrectly to the wrong category.
So that's what this is for. This will let you pick whether it's a personal document, which is where you leave it blank.
Or if it's a document you're going to apply only to sites or programs, you can check this box. The two other options here are really well not only for personal documents, but mostly utilize for personal documents.
So let's do something like ACOS search, right? We need to collect that from all of our trainees coming in. So we have two things we could do with that.
We can only allow one active document of this type per user. And so that's handy because if it's something that expires over time, which is something an ACOS certification would, then you'll know that if you're looking at an active document, that is the most recent document.
So there are processes of metrics that lets people upload new documents to replace, replace expiring ones. And so this prevents two active documents from existing at the same time for this category of documents.
So that's going to be helpful for reporting down the line. And this is most used for documents that do have expiration dates.
The other option here is the here is required for personal document compliance. And so that means that we have a couple of reports and metrics that let you see who has documents that are required of them.
So if we check this box, it basically means when we run a report, the system is going to assume that something should exist for these users because it's required for personal document compliance.
We'll have another video going over that particular report, but if there's something important that you're capturing during onboarding or something that you know needs to be attached to each user's profile, this is a good option to turn on.

How can a user make a benefit request
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about how a user from the personal portal can create their own benefit requests, which will require an administrator to approve them before they go into effect.
So if we look at the left nav, I'm currently on the personal portal for a resident type user. So we'll go to Benefits on the left.
And here I'll just get a list of any prior requests that I made. So I have a bunch here in this case.
But if I click on request time off, I can make a new request. And I've got a couple of different things I could do here.
So I select an account. So as we spoke about in earlier videos, basically the request has to be matched against an account.
So let's say I'm taking a planned vacation in the future. The only category attached to this right now is vacation as well.
So I'm just going to select that. But if there are further subcategories they will also need to pick the appropriate one.
The description here is basically a note. So hang on vacation. Sure, fine. And then in this case they will probably do full days.
So full days is pretty self-explanatory. We can pick the date that the vacation starts, pick the date that it ends, and then click submit.
So that's a pretty easy case for vacations and whole days. Let's say we have a different kind of scenario. Let's say we're actually doing a sick day, so we'll change our category.
And then in this case, I got sick during the bid day and I went home, right? So in those cases, I'm not actually doing a full day.
I'm doing a partial day. So I pick my day and I say while I got sick around noon and my shift Thanks for watching!
Lasted until five. So I'm taking five hours basically as part of my sick day. Submit the log and we can see here are the dates as well as the times and the duration.
Of course, not quite going on that. On vacation, whoops, guess I forgot to change that. But that is how you create benefits requests from the personal portal.

Medtrics - 22 April 2024
This video is to demonstrate how we can now edit the MSPE letters that the system has generated for us. So this will be from the admin portal in the top right hand corner.
We'll navigate to gradebook, generate MSPEs once again where we have generated the letters to begin with. And what we'll do is we'll filter by the template that we used and in this case, we can search for a particular user that we have in mind to do editing on.
And you can see we ran this generation a couple of times using this template. But on the Action menu in the right hand side, we can select Edit Document and it will open up similar to when we are editing the template.
You can see all of the merge fields have been filled in with the information within the system. And then this works just like a Word document.
So we can hit Enter, we can type something, get rid of something, just like you would in Microsoft Word to make any of those fine-tuned adjustments that are needed.
And that is how you can edit the document within the system. And then you would just hit save document. And it'll ask you to status it.
For now we can save it as a draft, but you can also choose any of these statuses that may apply.
And save the document. And all of those changes have now been saved.

Editing/deactivating/deleting document categories
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about editing or deleting existing document categories. So to do so, you must have institutional permission, so this is not something that a program admin can do.
They can utilize document categories, but they cannot actually edit, deactivate, or delete them. So we're going to switch to our Instagram.
We have a institutional portal here, so go to the right, click on institution, and then we'll find this under system setup and customize.
So here we're looking at the different document types slash categories, and you can see we've got a couple of different categories already in here.
So, editing them is a fairly simple process. Click on edit, you can change the name, and in the previous video we went over what all of these different things mean, so we're not gonna reiterate that.
So, you can make those edits and change those fields if necessary. You can also deactivate the document category, which means that all the related data is going to be preserved, but it's not going to be usable anymore.
So, you're not going to be able to create new documents. Against deactivated documents document categories, but they, all that stuff will still exist and you can still report on it.
And then you might notice here that only one of these document categories actually has a delete button. And that is because we prevent deletions if the category has any other associated data.
In this case, that is documents. So there are existing documents under all of these different document categories. However, for this one, the PLA, there is not.
So I'm able to click delete and confirm and it will then delete that document category. Before me, but you'll see all these other ones.
There's actually data associated with it. So the most I could do is deactivate it and kind of get it out of my way.
And if I ever need to go get it again, I can just go to active status filter up here, change to no.
Here's that category and I can reactivate it.

Expiration dates on documents
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about exploration dates on documents. So there are a few different places where you can see these exploration dates, but I'm just going to go to a user here and view their profile so I can have some context to talk to you about it.
So we'll go to John Doreen here, view their profile, and we're going to see this documents and certifications page here.
So you'll see this user already has a number of documents and you can see that a few of them are already there.
So talking about the expiration date if you create a new document, there's this expiration date field here that you could fill in and the reason I'm going to bring this one up is because in addition to just being able to track the expiration date and you know, see it on reports in various places, you
can also enable reminders about these expiration dates that can go out both to administrators in your program as well as the person That's it.
The document is about, in this case it would be John Dorian. So, expiration dates you're going to see in a variety of places, but I want to speak specifically about the reminders.
So to enable those reminders, go to system setup, and then settings, go to the documents tab, and you can see here you have two.
So this top one here, send email alerts of document explorations to document owners. That's what I was talking about where it would also email the person of the document.
It belongs to like John Dorian. If John Dorian has an upcoming expiring document, they would get emailed. But down here, you can also select specific admins that would get those notifications before the documents expire as well.
So by default, this does not go to all admins for a program. And you can select the specific ones that should receive the notification.

How can a user delete a benefit request from the personal portal?
Hi there, in this video we're talking about how a user can delete a previously created benefit request from their personal portal.
So I'm on the personal portal for a resident type user here, go to benefits on my left nav and here I will see the details of any previous benefit requests that I've made.
So the thing to note here, as you may have noticed, is that if the status of the request is already approved, rejected, or in this case reversed, then I cannot delete them.
Those are basically records. But if I've just submitted this, noticed I made a mistake. For example here, the category is sick, but I put the description as going on vacation.
Someone's going to be confused, so I'm maybe just better off deleting the whole thing. In which case I click delete, say yes.
And the benefit request is deleted.

Creating Graded Course Rotations in Metrix 📚
Hi there, in this video we're going over creating graded course rotations in Metrix. So what exactly is a graded course rotation?
The basic answer is kind of like the Metrix equivalent of what you might refer to as your course catalog at your institution.
So basically, here's the list of all the courses we offer, organized in some manner. So, let's jump into it here.
So I'm on the program admin portal, we'll go to curriculum, actually no we won't, we'll go to gradebook, and then setup.
And, uh, here we are, first tab, our graded course rotation, so you can see here I got some random data that we've made, so let's make something a little more, uh, consistent with a medical school.
So, many medical schools will have preclinical courses, core or clinical rotations, and then some kind of elective rotations that people might do.
So, let's Let's do an example. using, uh, core rotations. So, we will add a rotation type, graded course rotation, and we're just going to call these cores, right?
So, these are going to be the core rotations and internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, those kinds of things. And, we can also enter a required number of weeks, uh, so we'll just use the value of 40 here, for instance.
Uh, so here we are. So, now we have core rotations. And, so, if I click into the core rotations, I can now add, uh, rotations under it.
So, under my core rotations, I might have something like internal medicine, and I require p. people to take four weeks of that.
If I open it back up, you can see, now, internal medicine is one of my core rotations. And I can do this same kind of thing with, uh, internal courses.
So let's say we're gonna have our first year preclinical courses. So we'll call this preclinical courses. I'm just gonna give it a code pc here.
And we'll have a required number of credits for courses. So we'll just add 40. As a basic one there. And you can see now I have my preclinical courses under here.
Maybe I have, you know, anatomy or whatever it might be for credits. And there we go. Now I have anatomy under my preclinical courses.
So you're basically building your course catalog and metrics so we can link it to various other things in the system and produce MSPE letters, various reports, and do filtering on many different pages using MSPE.
using these graded course rotations.

What are benefit accounts?
Hi there. In this video we're talking about benefit accounts, where they are, what they are, and how they get used.
So if we take a look at our left nav here, we'll go under benefits, time off, and this is a view you're going to get when you're on the program administration portal and you go to this page.
So you'll notice here that it says we have 31 time off accounts showing up here. And it's basically one per training.
That's how this is going to work. And if you open up any of these, you'll see that everyone has a single time off account.
And under that account, they have multiple categories. So these are the same categories that exist under the benefit categories that you made.
And then you can open up each of these things and you can see any of the requests that were approved or not approved yet or what have you.
Show up under each of those accounts for the user. So we call them accounts because we treat this sort of like a transaction.
You know, you have a certain amount of vacation time. You're gonna draw against that time three days, right? So now you have three days less than that.
So we treat it a little bit like the counting. So we have called these accounts but really it's, it's quite simple.
Every user has the same amount of accounts under their one parent time off account, they will have the four sub accounts, which are our system defaults and they can make a request.
Against those accounts for time off.

Understanding Grade Statuses
Hi there, in this video we're going over creating grade statuses. So a grade status is very simply the status that you apply to a grade.
So often these are things like pass, fail, A, B, C, D, E, you know, well not really but these are the kind of things that you typically create as grade statuses and you apply as grades.
So to do this, you would go to gradebook setup from the program administration portal, then we go to score statuses and you can see that I already have two grade statuses here just doing a simple pass, fail kind of thing.
Now, when it comes to actually creating a grade status, you'll notice that they have a type. Uh, so the types are primary and secondary and this mostly comes into play in how our system does it.
So typically, most clients, they will only want to include grades that are primary type, right? These are typically things like pass, fail, A, B, C, D.
But in some cases, they might have some other kind of status that they're trying to use. Just to inform whoever's reading the MSP letter more about what happened at a particular rotation or a particular grade.
Uh, so these could be things like competency, uh, statuses, you know, exceeded expected competency, met expected competency, was below expected competency.
It can really be anything. But the easy way to think about it is that primary grade statuses should be whatever you're keeping in your SIS, whatever your official kind of records would have, what would show up on a transcript.
Whereas secondary, uh, grade statuses can be some other kind of status that is applied to a grade that may be interesting for people.
some people to see. So creating these is very simple, you just add a new grade status, select its type, if you want to include a description that might be helpful for other admins, you can add that here, click save, and as you can see we have our grade status, and then you can edit and delete them as
you see fit.

How can i report on data within personal documents?
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss reporting on the data within personal documents. So a lot of the different documents that you might include on a user's profile, things like certifications, licenses, vaccination records, things like that, they probably have exploration dates or other bits
of information. That you'd like to pull out of the system along with maybe some other information tied to the user.
So because of that we treat documents a lot like demographics. So you can use the demographics reports and metrics in order to pull that data out.
So let's do an example of that. So to run this report we would go to reports from our left nav on the app.
This is also available from the institutional portal. It'll be very much the same. Go to demographics and then we're going to want the user information.
Option here on institutional portal is called user profile information I believe. We'll go to select criteria and I'm just going to cast a very wide net here because I'm mostly interested in showing you this section here, documents and certifications.
So in this section, we can basically pick the different document categories. And we're just going to pull the latest or active document for each user for the category.
So I'm going to pick ACLS certification here, I cast a wide net, and go ahead and download that excel file and we'll pull in here is this.
So you can see here I've pulled the different users and of course there's all these other demographic fields that I could choose to include or exclude from my report when I run this, but mostly I want to talk about these right here.
So all the different possible fields that are attached to something like a document are shown here. So we have the acs certification name, any id number associated with that, the expiration date, if there's any additional description that could be applied here and you can even see if there's a file attached
to it it'll be identified. So by utilizing this demographic report you can pull data out of the system about the documents in the context of a user and all of their other demographic fields as well.

Medtrics - 20 October 2023
Hi there. In this video, we're going to be talking about the Manage Documents page and some of its uses for managing your documents.
Who'da thunk, right? So if we go to Documents, and then click on the Manage Documents tab here, on the Program Portal, Well, this is.
This is basically a list of all the different documents that are linked to all of the users in your program.
You can see you have a number of different search fields here. And you have this Excel button where you can pull down the results of that search at any given time.
So, a couple of easy ones to think about here, of course, you could search for a specific person. So far.
I just want to pull all of John Dorian's documents. I could do that. I could pull it by document category so I could see everyone's ACLS certifications.
And then something that I particularly like is the status search. So, one of the obvious ones here. Here is archived.
So, archive shows me all of the documents that have previously been archived. I then also have expired. So, any documents that have already expired according to their expiration date will show up here.
Pretty useful. Of course, you want to kind of stay ahead of this if you can on our demo server. You can see that, oh, we haven't looked at this in quite a while.
But you can see when it expired and how many days it's been since. But you can also look at the upcoming ones here.
So, expiring within 90 days. We can see we got 72 days. 11 days, 41 days here. Within 60 days, within 30 days.
And we've talked in other videos about the notifications surrounding expiration dates, but this is pretty handy to be able to just pull a list.
Okay, here are the documents expiring in 30 days. Let me hit the Excel button and pull that down. You can also search for expiration days via these fields here for the date range.
So if you think of something that, oh, it's going to expire next year, you can always include that here and get that list of documents too.
And then finally, we have review compliance. For required document types. So if you've made a specific document category required as part of, hey, every user should have this, you can just pick the document type and it will pull it in here and also for, missing.
So the interesting part about this is you can just click missing and it will show you all the users that do not currently have documents against this document type.
So this is effectively a report of who does not have documents against this type. And you can also, if you have multiple types, then you can use these two in conjunction as well.
So you can say status is missing and then pick from one of the multiple types of documents that you have here.

How do benefit accounts get created for users?
Hi there. In this video we're talking about benefit accounts and how to make them for users and I got good news for you.
You don't really have to do anything. The system handles most of this, so I'm just going to explain this pretty quickly.
So if we go under benefits and time off you'll see that I already have 31 time off accounts of users.
A quick recap of what this means. Every trainee user, when they get created in metrics and you have the benefits module turned on, gets a time off account made for them automatically.
So there's actually nothing you need to do to create the accounts. They will just exist. If you think you should have them and you don't see them, it might be a configuration issue or perhaps your institution did not purchase this module.
But if that's the case, always feel free to contact us at Metric Support. That's help at metricslab.com. And we can help you get that sorted.
If that something was not made correctly, we can get those made. And then as you create new users, there's not an extra thing you need to do.
If the benefits module is enabled for your program or institution, it will automatically continue to make new accounts for new users.
As they get created.

Introduction to Evaluations
Metrics Evaluations Module is one of the more popular modules used by medical schools, nursing school, residency programs, fellowship programs, and allied health professionals.
The module contains all of the different types of evaluations that needs to be used for a training program. Evaluations and assessments are an integral part of medical education, nursing education, as well as professional graduate medical education.
Evaluations serve two purposes. One is it helps maintain accreditation and fulfill the requirements from the national accrediting body. However, the more important part of evaluation, or the the more important reason why.
One of the most important training programs conducted by evaluations is to ensure that the trainees are getting adequate tran- ensure that the trainees are getting appropriate training and graduating as competent nurses or physicians.
In metrics, the evaluation modules contains- the evaluation module contains a few different sub-menu items. On the templates page, we have the ability to- to curate various templates.
Here we can review the different type of training program different types of forms that we offer. Each form is tied to a different automation rule and uses a different type of schedule to send those out to the- the trainees, faculty members, preceptors, and so.
So, what? The course-based evaluation is used to collect feedback on classroom-based courses. The session evaluation is used to collect feedback on individual lectures, labs, and small group sessions that take- that make up a course.
Rotation-based evaluation is used to collect feedback on- clinical rotations, clerkships, and other clinical experiences. We have the program evaluation, which collects feedback on the overall training program.
The event-based eval is used to collect feedback on the calendar events. And often in medical school, these are one-off events in residency programs.
They may be didactic lectures or other topics that they're covering for the trainees. The general survey form type used to collect feedback from an individual, but not necessarily evaluating someone.
And it sometimes used to collect self feedback. Institution. No evaluations are used by institutional administrators. To collect feedback on the overall institution.
When evaluations are assigned. They are sent to the trainees, faculty members and preceptors. Via email. Using a link that they can click on and complete the form without having to sign in.
All assigned evaluations are tracked on the assignments page on the admin portal. So there are various filters on this page that can be used to find.
And then we can incorporate a evaluation and track if it was completed. The trainees and faculty members, the educators and trainees can also log into metrics and complete their evaluations.
They can also view evaluations that were completed on them. In their portal. There are various reports that come with metrics for evaluations and these can be met on the reports page.
And in addition to the standard reports, we also handle competency based evaluations. And these competency based evaluations have the. More reports on the performance page that could be used to track various comfort competencies longitudinally.
Metrics also in. It includes permissions under system set up and permissions that can be used to assign. Evaluation permissions to different administrators.
Well, not necessarily administrators to non-admins to access various types of evaluations. And in the next few videos, we'll be covering each of these topics in more detail.

Rotation Evaluation Template
In this evaluation article, we're going to be covering the rotation-based evaluation, which is used for clinical training. So, under evaluations, templates, we have the ability to create various types of evaluation forms.
One of the evaluation forms we can create here is the new rotation based evaluations and then click type in a name.
A name should be descriptive and allow anyone else that is using the platform to identify what this form will be used for.
So let's call this end of clerkship or let's say end of clinical. Patient evaluation of student. So it's also good to be descriptive of who will be evaluated.
I can write a description if I want to that will provide more instruction to the evaluator. So this description field.
The second field on this page and it allows whatever we show here or right here will be displayed at the top of the form when the evaluator is completing it.
Next field on the activation date. The activation date is used to tell metrics when this form should start assigning. So whatever date you set here, that's when metrics will start checking the schedules to see if evaluation assignment should be made.
If you want evaluations to be assigned for past clinical rotations, you can set this date back and it'll pick up past rotations.
Typically, it's done by leaving it for us today's date when we want this, the form to become activated. We'll be covering some of these other items in a different video, so I'll skip over that.
_____ On the Manage Questions tab is where we can create different types of questions. _____ For clinical evaluations, you can write your _____.
_____ On the Manage Questions tab is where we can create different types of questions. Create them and then import it to the form on the Manage Questions tab.
There's also a way to import competencies. So if you're created standard set of competencies or if you're an ACG ME accredited training program that's using the ACG ME as milestones, those can be imported.
Onto the form here. Then let's go to the last tab which is going to be the Set Assignment Rules. The Assignment Rules tab will allow us to set what type of automa- ization we want to do with this clinical evaluation template.
To complete this, we have to answer a few questions. What's being evaluated? So for this rotation I can choose self, the rotation, or people in the rotation.
Self evaluation is if I'm going to be evaluating, I'm going to be asking the evaluator to evaluate themselves. The rotation evaluation means that someone is going to be evaluating the rotation experience.
People in the rotation means that we're going to be asking people to evaluate each other. So that could be the trainee evaluating the faculty or the preceptor or the trainee getting evaluated by one of the educators.
There will be a faculty or a preceptor. What rotations do we want to include? Here's where we can see all the rotations that are available at our, in our, in our program.
And I can enable one or two or I can enable all of them. There's also a search bar that can be used to search for rotations.
Who should complete this form? This section is used to select the roles, groups who will act as evaluators. The other thing to remember here is there's also an include rotation supervisors option.
If this is enabled, it's going to pull in all the supervisors of faculty members that are linked to the rotations that we have selected.
So, who will complete this form? If you're using a rotation based evaluation where the, you have added supervisors to the rotation, you want to make sure it's very important that you turn this check box on.
And the other option is select, choose to assign using roles. So if I come down here. And choose preceptor. This means that anyone with the role of preceptor.
Will. Will serve as evaluator. Or this training program. Who will be evaluated. Here's where we can select which individuals Will act as evaluators.
And again we have roles, groups. And the ability to select rotation supervisors as evaluators. Down here if I choose roles.
Pgy123 that means those individuals will be acting as trainees. If I choose groups. In either of these sections I also have the ability to select a bunch of groups that I have added to the system earlier.
Under the users and groups page. Next we have should this form be automatically assigned. I can should assign automatically based on the rotation schedules.
So the rotation schedules are created under schedules or under clinical schedules for medical schools and metrics is going. So we're going to be checking on a daily basis to see if there are any preceptors working with PGY1, 2 or 3 if I choose these roles and see if they need an evaluation.
So if I add a rule here that says, let's say, assign. So when I click on add. That assignment day, it brings up a pop-up where I can say, I can choose to assign minus five days from the end of the rotation.
So I'm choosing enter, typing in minus five and then choose. I'm choosing end and for the drop-down and click save.

Creating document templates to generate documents from
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about generating documents from metrics. So this is one of the, I'd say, time saver, you know, more powerful features of metrics if you leverage it properly but basically you can create a lot of different documents that might, you might need to create and have
signed and all that kind of thing within metrics and handle the whole situation in here instead of going to a Word doc template, filling it in, sending it via email, and like all that kind of stuff.
So to do so you'll want to be on the institution portal and we're going to start with the basic tricks in this video, which is just creating the template.
So under documents, if you go to templates, you'll see I already have one here and we'll use this one in future videos, but we'll go ahead and make a new one.
So we'll just call this example. And so the first step is to decide what program or programs this document template will be used for.
So you can do a select all here if that's appropriate, or if it's only going to be in use for a specific program, you can also select that here.
So let's say we're going to do internal medicine here. Then you can select what roles this will apply to. So if it's something that it's not going to be useful for your trainees you might want to set that up.
So let's say P2R1, P2R1, P3 users will apply to this. And then down here we can select the document category and let's see what we get.
We got here we'll call new hire document review. So that's important. When the document is generated it's going to go under that document category.
And then lastly here at the bottom we have edit permissions. So basically can someone edit the document after it's created or not.
So depending on how it works in an institution you may or may not want to enable that. So that's step one.
Step two is going to be including merge fields. So merge fields, they're going to have their own video because they can get either simple or complex depending on what you need to do with them.
But basically, you can select the one. Ones that you want to include here. And the way merge fields work in general is that if I include a merge field on a document, say a merge field for someone's first name, instead it will just replace that field with whatever that user's first name is.
So if you're familiar with like mail merge or some of the other. Tools that are similar that you might have used in emails or other things over the years.
It works very much like that, but based upon metrics data. So we'll just go ahead and say now what we got here, birthday.
We'll include users birth dates. And then lastly here, we have the actual document writer. So this is what you will use to enter the document template into the system.
So as you can see with all the buttons, it's a pretty fully featured document writer here. You can also copy paste from a word document.
Although, depending on what kind of formatting you have with that word document, Thank you. Results may vary so best bet is always just to retype it into the system using this tool.
And then just basically here, to insert merge fields as you are creating a document, you just select the merge field you want to insert from this, select where you want to put it.
And hit add merge field, and you'll see this little format here with the curly brackets and the hashtag. That tells the system this is a merge field.
So when I generate this document for a user, it's going to go look at that user's information, go find their birth date, and then put their birth date wherever I put this merge field.
So basically that's how it works, and be sure to check out the remaining videos to understand merge fields and how this process all comes together.

Viewing a users benefit accounts
Hi there, in this video we're talking about viewing our user's different benefit accounts. So I'm on the program administration portal, we'll go to benefits on our left nav, we'll go to time off, and I will be presented with a list of my benefit time off accounts.
So discussed in previous videos these are automatically created as you create new trainee type users in metrics if this module is enabled for your programs.
And so each user will get a time off account they will get four sub accounts underneath that and if we view any of these sub accounts and we can see here there's different numbers of entries against each of the accounts already I can open one of these up like say vacation so I'm looking at the vacation
sub account for user out carav open that up and I can see all the activity that has occurred underneath that particular sub account so here's all the vacations requested vacations approved a vacation that was then reversed and then some more entries here so the full history of any entries made against
that account will appear here and you can view that anytime you can also search up here to narrow down your results so let's say i'm only looking at pgy1 trainees so i can limit it to that or if i have a specific person i want to look at i can also limit it that way so this is the easiest way to access
all the information about a user's benefits request regardless of whatever account type they might be under from one place in metrics

Create Evaluation Templates: Part 1
In this video we're going to take a look at how to create evaluation templates in metrics. So if you're an administrator for a medical school, nursing school, or residency or fellowship program, you will be setting up evaluations for various types of feedback.
To set up these forums, we'll go to two tabs. We have active and inactive. So the active tab shows all the templates that we currently have active in this program.
Then there's also some other filters at the tab. So let's say something is an open evaluation or supports ad hoc evaluations or whether something is classified as a confidential or anonymous form.
So these are filters that allow you to find templates quickly. Let's create a new form here. To create a new form, we're going to click the create new template button at the top right.
This will bring up a modal window that lists out all the different types of evaluations that metric supports. Each of these form types are linked to a different type of automation rule.
And selecting the appropriate one is important if you want to automatically deliver these forms based on different types of work schedules.
And we went into the form types and, a different article. So we're going to focus on creating a form. And for this example, I'm going to bring up the form build.
And the first page on this form builder is the basic setup, which allows me to edit the the name, the confidentiality settings, and a few other options.
So as we go down the page, we have the first field, which is giving it a name. And I give this a name called end of rotation valuation.
You want the name to be descriptive and also tell the other administrators what this form is for. So by using the name end of rotation, I know that is going to be used to administer a feedback.
At the end of a rotation. Then we have the description field. We can write whatever we want in here. And this field also supports some formatting such as bold, italic.
And whatever information is added to the description field will be shown to the evaluator each time they complete the form.
It will be displayed with it. And it will be displayed on top as a description field. Next we have activation date.
The activation date is what metrics use us to start assigning evaluations. So from the activation date metrics will start monitoring the schedule.
And send out evaluations for all the users. And the important thing to note is that the activation date must be before the start date of any schedules.
So for example, if you have a clinical schedule that starts July 1st. And the block starts on July 1st. The activation date must be June 30th or earlier.
If you put it July 1st, it will not work. Next, we have confidentiality settings. And the confidentiality setting allows us to collect feedback from trainees.
So, if we have a resident or a student completing feedback for a faculty member or a course or a rotation, we want to make sure that that information is confidential.
And no one knows which resident or student said, provided that feedback. By enabling this check box called Meet Submission, Make Submission Confidential, metrics will automatically remove the name, role, and, The contacts, which is the rotation name or the course name and the course dates or rotation
dates from the submission, and it will be labeled as anonymous. So if someone opens the form, they can see the feedback but they won't be able to see who submitted it.
And you can also run reports on it. These confidential submissions are not available, available for to be viewed on the personal portal for faculty members or other local administrators that don't have the full administrative privileges.
We also have a setting called Confidential Publishing, which allows the administrator to specify, how many after how many responses metrics should publish a batch of confidential evaluations.
So let's, you can see this field here that says responses will become viewable after X submissions have been received. So, if we put a number in there and save this setting, so let's say five, every five submission on this form metrics will publish that to the evaluates so they can see these evaluations
in batch. Next we have submission alert options. So these, alerts are emailed to the individuals that need to be notified when certain things are submitted.
So automatic alerts is the first option here. When an evaluation is submitted by the evaluator with a PDF attachment of that submission.
So every time someone is submitting an evaluation, mentors will send an email with a PDF attachment. Manual alerts on the other hand.
Manual evaluation alerts gives the evaluator a button at the bottom so they can trigger a notification. So you can customize the language here.
The following text will be shown to the person submitting the evaluation and you can type in some instructions and when the evaluator gets to the bottom of the evaluation, they're able to click a little button check, click a little button and then an email will be sent out to the individuals that
are specified on this on this template. Next, we have low score alerts. These alerts are sent out to individuals when a low score criteria is triggered.

Creating Merge Fields
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about creating these things in metrics called merge fields. So this is all in the context of generating documents and metrics.
So to do so, we need to be on the institution portal, go to documents on your left nav and click merge.
So you'll see, and when you log into metrics, you might see a number of these that just exist automatically as well as there's a couple of different types, right?
So some of the merge fields that exist here are system types. So these are tied directly to fields in the system.
So it's going to be pulling forward. From things like the first name field, last name field on a user, right?
So it's tied to the system. And these are the things you might see in here automatically when you first log in and view this page.
Then you have these other fields that are custom. And so they will come in different flavors as well. So there's some select fields, there's date fields, there's dependent fields.
So there's a lot of different things and we'll go over each of them in this series of videos. But first we'll just talk about the basic creating a merge field and we'll go with a system field that doesn't already exist.
So, we'll see. So we're going to click on new field and we're going to do something really simple here. We're just going to do first name and last name, right?
So go ahead and click enter first name into the field name and then because this is an existing system field, we can just go to system field.
And then we'll pick it from our list here. First name. So this now allows us when we are creating a document for a user, if we reference that user's first name within the document template, we will insert that doc, that user's first name into the document that we generate for them.
And then with all of these viewers, We also have the ability to allow the value to be edited when creating a document.
For something like this, I would not recommend it. Metrics should be the source of truth here, so whatever first name they have in the system should be their first name, right?
So this should all work out, so we'll go ahead and, click save. And now we have created this merge field, and so we'll just kind of repeat the process here quickly.
Add last name as well. Same thing. And so now both of these values are usable upon or within our documents that we generate.
So let's talk about some of the other types now, and we'll do a couple of the easy ones. So we're going to do text fields.
Text fields are exactly what they sound like. They're not going to be pulling data in from anywhere. We're also not going to be giving the people generating the documents any kind of rules about what they can put in there.
So this is a pure text field. So enter whatever you want. So that's not going to be possible. There's going to be a ton of use cases for something like this, especially when you're generating things like employment contracts.
Probably all of that has been gone through legal and there's very specific things that can be inserted into these kinds of merge fields.
But if there is a use case for text fields, that's what this is. So in this case, kind of doesn't make a lot of sense because while the whole thing is editable, it's a text field that I could just put information into.
So go ahead and click save to do that. And then when we do so, we can add a default. So if it is something that hey, it's pretty much going to be this for everyone, but maybe maybe, you know, five percent of people, they get some different value here, some different text to show up in the document.
But we can add whatever the default text we want it to be when we generate a document. So that is a text type.
And the other one I'll go into in this video is a select type. So select types are a little different.
So with a select type, it's kind of like think of it like a drop down or multiple choice, right? So we're going to pick from a list instead of just putting in whatever text we want.
So we'll say this is a drop down field. And so you'll see here that there's also, we can make this a dependent field.
We're going to say no in this case, and I'm going to have a whole different video about how to deal with dependent merges.
Because you could do some pretty cool stuff with those. So we'll say no. We'll allow this to be editable because we do want it to be editable in this case.
Click save and continue. And then it's done. And again, we'll be able to select the different options that we want here.
So we'll add some values. So option one, this will be the default value that is applied, but we'll have other ones too.
Option three. So when people are generating documents, they'll be able to pick which one of these to apply. And oftentimes this can coincide with like, say, a level of training.

Who is shown/schedulable on a block schedule?
Hi there, in this video we're going to be going over who has shown and who is scheduleable on one of your block schedules.
So I'm here on the dashboard, so to head on over to block schedules, I'll just click schedules on my left nav.
This will be my default tab, so we're in the right place. And so this is really about, who we show on a block schedule, and there's going to be some other videos talking about the best ways to choose that.
But in general, when you look at this page, you will see who is available to schedule on your block schedule, just from these little tags here under the block schedule name.
So you can see in this case, I just have a PGY1, 2, or 3 user roles displayed here. So anyone that matches that criteria, if they're a PGY1, a PGY2, or a PGY3 resident, they will show up on my block schedule.
And so let's edit this block schedule and see how we can go about changing that. We scroll down to this section here that says select users to include in schedule.
You're basically going to have three different ways that you could put people on the schedule, depending on what's best for your situation.
So if you have a look at this, there's going to be select user roles, select select individuals. So to create a block schedule, you'll need to fill out one of these.
So either one role, one group, or one person. As long as that exists, you'll be able to create a block schedule, but you also come in here and edit this whenever you might need to.
So if you want to add more people to it later, whether that's roles, groups, or as individuals, you can always do that.
There's nothing limiting you. So if we have a look at this, we'll see under roles, I have selected P2I1, 2, and 3.
So again, any users matching that criteria that are currently active in my program metrics will show up on the block schedule and can be scheduled to write.
So I can actually create rotation schedules for them. My other option here, we would use user groups. So if I have specifically segmented some of my users into different groups, I can utilize those instead, instead of using rotations or roles.
So that can be useful in some cases, a common use case that we see for that is sometimes when you're dealing with a program that has a lot of visiting residents or students you can group them by their home institution.
So wherever they're coming from. So if you want to make separate block schedules for each of those, that can sometimes be helpful, especially if you're splitting up the work amongst your team of coordinators.
If a certain coordinator is responsible for students coming from a certain school this is a good way to break that up.
So you can like groups here. And then last, and I guess you could say most specific is just individual users.
So if you want to pick a person, click on them, it'll add them to the list of users that are specifically added to the block schedule.
So a lot of cases, most programs will use roles and fewer cases, people you. Will use groups and then in not too many cases, people will use individuals, but the individuals is really good for adding individuals when most people match a group rule, match a role rule, but don't, if for people that
don't necessarily match either of those, you can just add them individually to the block schedule to get. Hit them on there and this way you can pretty much get anyone in your program on a block schedule and add their rotation schedules if needed.
That's the end of this video. Thanks for watching.

Why can't I see a users benefit account?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about why you might not be seeing a trainee's user account even though they are part of your program.
And so we're going to use our demo user John Dory in here as an example. So I'm currently under the program school of medicine.
I search for the user John Dory and I can see that user in my program. So definitely part of my program, right?
No problems there. But when I go to benefits, go to time off, I do not see John Dorian in my list here, right?
And you would think that hey, it's part of my program. Maybe I should be seeing that. And the reason you are not is because even though John Dorian in this case is affiliated with your program in this case it's called School of Medicine here, his primary program though is not School of Medicine.
So any kinds of benefit requests that are created in the system for the sake of keeping records of all of those requests and what happened with them as well as getting approval from the correct place all of that is routed through the primary program.
So in this demo instance, John Dorian's primary program is internal medicine. So you can see when I switch to it, now I'm seeing John Dorian because this is his primary program.
So all of these benefit requests come through the user's primary program. If it should be through your program and you're still not seeing it perhaps their primary program was set inappropriately, but in many cases if you are the secondary program or just a program they're rotating through right now
you probably still want to get the sign off by the user's primary program and that's why it was built in this way.

Create Evaluation Templates: Part 2 - Manage Questions
In this video we're going to take a look at how to create questions for an evaluation form. When you are creating an evaluation template, there are two ways to add questions to a form.
The first approach is to create a set of questions. In the question bank, and then import those questions into different templates.
This allows you to create a standardized set of questions that can be used in multiple forms. This the second way to put questions on a form is to create them directly on the template.
This is sometimes, easier to create, because you don't have to plan and create a question bank first. But one thing to note is that if you are trying to create the same questions on multiple forms, then making it directly on the form will not allow you to do that.
So even if the questions are named exactly the same and you create, you want two separate forms, metrics will treat them as two separate questions, and you won't be able to average the results together.
So if you want to first decide which approach you want to use, then you can use a combination. You can have some questions that are in the evaluation form itself.
So first, let's take a look at how to create this on the question bank, and then we'll take a look at how to make that on the form itself.
So to create questions in the question bank, we go to evaluations, questions. This takes us to the question bank page.
And the first thing we have to do here is, create a category. So every question has to be added to a category, and these categories can be based on some performance level or some sort of rotation names.
Whatever you want to categorize is fine. There's no right or wrong approach for this. Some training programs even have one big category that contains all their questions.
So I'm going to go ahead and create this category, and it'll say this is going to be evaluation questions. Then, once I make the category under the categories tab, so under the categories tab, I click new question category, and that's how I made my category.
Then I go to the questions tab, and here, you'll see that there are various filters that show up. I can filter by active questions or inaccurate questions, filter by questions that has been responded to at least once, show me all the confidential questions, anything that was preloaded by metrics.
It's called system generated questions, and then questions that were created on the template itself. Then there's different question types that I can filter by, or I can even filter by different templates.
And the last thing here is filtering by categories. So we'll skip the filters and then create a new question. So click new question on the top right.
This brings up my question builder model window. And first thing that I can do at the top is select. Select the question type, set question type.
This, this defaults to Likert questions. If I can change it to competency, multiple choice, text, numeric, checklist, date, document upload, and I'll be.
Obviously, Likert. So, let's take a look at each of these question types. Competency questions are similar to Likert and multiple choice, but they have a second.
Retributor field. So, these are let's say I want to ask a question such as, please evaluate the trainees. Professionalism. And then there's a description field I can add for a question.
But I want to have some subtext that appears under there. And then I scroll down. They have some, we have some pre-fill answers.
So, if I choose one of these, it'll give me some pre-filled options. There are several options here including Likert scale that shows strongly agree, agree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.
And then there's a second Likert scale which is below expectation, meets a, expectation exceeds expectation. Then we have competency levels, the low competency, approaching competency, competent, beyond competent.
The Likert 4 scale is poor, fair, good. Very good, excellent. Then we have a yes or no option. And then we have some customized ones such as intrustability and swish scales for surgical evaluations.
The key thing here is that I can customize these scales however I want. I can make my own scale if I choose to do that.
And each option is tied to a numeric value. So you can see that strongly disagree. It is one, disagrees two, neutrals three, and so on.
And behind the scenes, the metrics uses these values to average data on their reports. So let's say we're dealing with competency scales.
And you can see that each competency scale has a description. So this is a competency question type. And now we have a description field for that.
So let's say my first question was, please evaluate the trainees professionalism below expectation. I can write a description of what it means to be below description below expectation.
Training, professional, clinical rotation. So that's the main difference between a competency scale and a like-er or a multiple choice question.
If I switch over to like-er you can see that the descriptor has now disappeared. Multiple choice, same thing, we'll see what those questions look like in a few minutes.

Inserting Merge fields into a document template
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about inserting some of the merge fields that we've created into an existing document template.
So we're on the institution portal here like we have been for all the other actions we've taken go to documents on your left nav then go to templates and we'll pick an existing template here we'll go to edit and we've already made the merge fields in an earlier video so we're just going to go add them
as potential merge fields to the template so to do that we'll go to step two here manage merge fields and we'll go find them we just added the first name right so I have to do is click select you'll see it changed to orange when it is selected so we've already added that here and then we do the same
with last name right so I already added that before the video here but that's what you would do and you can add any other ones while you're here of course if you need to but we're just going to use those two for now and on the next step we can now come in here and basically replace some of this template
text with our actual merge field so as you can see here this is just like some employment template we grab from online as an example and we have this section here for employee right so what we can do is remove that and instead reference the users first and last name so I'll kind of do that again so we'll
just place our cursor wherever we want the merge fields to appear click on the merge field we want to insert and click add merge field and in this case since it's a person's name I want them to follow each other so that's what we have first and last name so what's going to happen here is when we generate
the document for this user these fields that appear on the template like this are going to be replaced with that user's first and last name as it is stored in the metrics data so this way we don't have to go and just kind of type it in or anything like that it'll just happen by clicking a button

Who can see a block schedule?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about who can see the block schedules that we bake under our program.
So I'm on the dashboard right now. We're going to go to schedules on the left nav and the default tab here is going to be block schedules.
So this is what we're talking about. So the answer to this is by default. The block schedule is only shown to users like yourself, users that are administrators for the program.
We could change that and allow other people to view the block schedules in much the same way that we see them.
But without taking that action, the block schedules are not shown directly to any particular person, but they will of course always see their own schedule.
The block schedules via their personal portal calendar or various other views that we offer on the personal portal. But by default, they're not going to see something like this where they can click on something called resident master schedule and then see the whole block schedule like this, right?
Where they can see everyone on it, where everyone is. But in a lot of cases, that is desirable. So. Let's talk about how we can change that.
So if we look at one of these block schedules, I've already created resident master schedule, we'll click edit. And then in this section down here, we have view only access.
So you could see right now this block schedule is actually. Actually already viewable by all of these roles in my program.
So if there's a user and they're active and they match one of these roles that I've selected, then they can see the whole block schedule on their personal portal.
So not just their own schedules, but everyone's schedules, whatever appears on the block schedule. We can always limit this if we want.
So if I only want, say my residents to see it, P2L one, two, and three, I can do that. Right.
And so now only users that match this rule P2L one, two, and three will be able to see the this particular.
The block schedule. And if I save this, that would be applied. I can also add people individually. So if only certain people should be able to see the block schedule, but not everyone by role, I could add those individuals here and then they will be able to see the block schedule on their personal portal
. And then lastly, if I just want to make sure that I'm not make an overall rule down here at the bottom, there's provide view only access to the schedule to all users affiliated with this program.
That's basically blanket viewing permission. So if you have anything to do with this program, if you have an affiliation to it, then if I click this checkbox, you'll be able to see.
It on the personal portal view. And so again, you can change these to modify or add people to who can see the block schedule.
And just to be clear, when we say see the block schedule, we're talking about this view where basically they can click on it and they can see.
Everything in a block schedule, just like an administrator would just without the ability to actually edit anything. And there's one other way that people can see a block schedule.
And that's with this simple view. So it's going to be a very similar view as to what you see on the regular block schedule.
But the trick with this one is this URL, this link opens in a, it's a public link. And basically what that means is you do not have to be logged into metrics to see that schedule.
So the URL from this link, and you can always just like copy link address or just copy it once it opens, you can distribute that in various places.
If you want to post that on your intranet, if you want to just have it on a notepad at a nursing station, whatever it is, people can click on that and then see that block schedule without needing to log in or even having a log into metrics.
It doesn't matter. It's a public facing link. So that can also be useful in a variety of cases. That's it for this video.
Thank you for watching.

Approving/Rejecting benefit requests from your users
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about approving or rejecting benefit requests made by users in your program. So I am on the program administration portal under internal medicine and here we'll go to benefits on the left nav.
The initial tab, here is the accounts page, but what we're looking for is the requests page. So when you come here, you will get a list of all the different requests that have ever been made on your program.
You can filter by roles. So if I want to look at requests made by PGY1 users or something like that, I can.
I can also select a role and then select a person to filter down to only their requests. Another filter option I have here, if I just want to like, thumb through these things right now, the default status is all.
So I'm seeing all types of requests, whether they're already approved or they reject. I can see the ball here, but if I wanted to say, see all the previously rejected requests, I could just click rejected.
I'll get a list of that. You can see John Dorian here tried to start a tomato farm during his training.
Turns out not a great idea. I did not accept that request. So going back to all here, I got two examples.
So these are submitted by Alec here. They have not yet been approved. So I can see what's going on. The geese are classified as a leave of absence.
I can see it's a description, not a very good description in this case, but it is there nonetheless. I could see what it was created and what days it is for.
So if I think this is fine, I can go ahead and approve this request. That's all there is to it.
It is now approved. That's done. It is being shown in various places as an approved request. And if I don't like it, if it's something I want to reject, I'm going to reject the quest and now it is logged as rejected.
Now I do also have the option here of deleting requests. It depends on how straight you want to be with your record key thing, right?
So if you want to keep really accurate records, we don't recommend deleting things. You want to have a full transaction history or everything that happened.
But if something was just made by mistake for whatever reason, and they never actually meant to submit it at all, and that's why you rejected it not a bad idea to maybe just delete it.
You do also have the option to just delete it outright if you run into a situation like that.

26 July, 2023 - Understanding-Medtrics-Competency-Reports
So in this video, we're going to take a look at the different competency reports that are available in metrics. So the first one is the competency page that's on the performance competency tab that is in the performance page.
This report brings all of the different competency averages together on one page that you could interact with and dig deeper into the data.
So first thing I did was I chose a wide day range from 2020 to 2024 for this demo user that we have here.
And then if we come down, I can turn on different settings and generate the report. And as we get to the bottom, you can see that competency performance is broken down into a hierarchy.
And this is the highest level. And then patient care has an average for the highest level. And then if you go deeper into that competency, we have sub-competencies in here.
So the same thing applies for EPO's. So the hierarchies recreated based on the school's data. And then it'll have averages.
And if you go into the sub-competency, it'll have averages for those. And then each question that it's mapped to that sub-competency, we have averages for those questions.
And this continues into each of those core competencies in sub-competencies. And as we get to the bottom, we will have comments that were added by the Evaluate source.
There is also a competency committee report that we provide in the second page. And on this, you can select a day range, choose the different components of the competency committee report, and then select the user.
This report has schedules at the top that controls all of the clinical rotations that were submitted that were completed by the trainee, the competency performance with the averages, any attendance records, case logs that were entered in that day range, exam scores, and comments that were submitted
during that day range. Then we have the puller graphs with the competency graphs, and we select a day range, and then metrics will create separate charts for each of the core competencies and sub-competencies and again, we call it incompetencies, but it for each of the schools, if they're using EPO's
milestones, objectives, the data structure is going to be the same, it's going to show the averages based on what was collected on the evaluations.
There's also a scatter plot that gets generated, that shows the data over a period of time and how it is spread across the different responses, and then there's also a reviews page where it's a mentor or director, it can look at each of the students' performance and then submit a review if needed.
Those are the reports that are on the performance page, in addition to those reports on the evaluations reports page, we have the evaluation summary report.
This report can also be used to see performance data, although it doesn't map, competency averages, but still we can come in here, select a day range, choose one of the forms, and then see how we want to group that data and then run it.
If I group the data differently, the averages will be adjusted based on the grouping, but I did in group the data and group this response here, and it's simply averaging based on the question, choose the total responses, percentage, and the response mean.
And for comments, I also have a way to search inside of the comments that we're submitted and find what I find.
So it's simply a way to select the submissions, see the averages, see all the comments, and then export that into PDF.
On the evaluation reports page, we also have a subcompensy report. If I choose this with the same date range that we have selected earlier, I can choose a role.
We're looking at the metrics subcompensy report. This is exported in Excel format, and it contains evaluation data or competency data for multiple trainees in the program.
So if you run this for a large number of trainees, it can be emailed to you after it's generated, and it may take some time to pull all the data together.
Essentially what it has is all the trainees listed on the left side, and along the top, we have the different subcompensies.
And each of those subcompensies have an average, and this data is getting pulled from those evaluation averages, and they're rolled into those subcompensy averages, and then we have a summary here.
And this report has two sheets. The first sheet has these average, average for every subcompensy for the entire date range.
And in the second detailed view, we have the separate roll for every subcompensy. So you can see here, this is a user, and we have the subcompensy.
And for each subcompensy, we're showing how many times this trainee was evaluated on the subcompensy, the average for that subcompensy, the peer number of evaluations, and the peer average.
With this data, it's a administrator or director or dean can look at it and make a decision on whether or not there was sufficient number of sampling over that period of time.
So if you, for example, if you have a competency, that was only assessed one time, then that may not be enough data to make a decision on whether or not the trainee is competent.
And if you have more confidence that the individual is competent or not competent in that competency or EPL. So first sheet will give you the summary, the second sheet will give you the number of times the trainee was evaluated.

Reversing a previous accepted benefit request
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about how to reverse a benefit request that has already been approved. So I'm here on the Program Admin Portal for my program, going to go to Benefits, click Time Off.
I'll see a list of my accounts and we're just going to use Alec Carav as our example here. So to do this, we'll open up his Time Off account.
We'll get a list of all the different sub-accounts that are under here. And let's say I actually want to reverse this via Vabsence.
Turns out he doesn't need to go on leave. So click into that. And we can see the entry that was made here.
So you can see requested a couple of days off. It was then approved. And then what I can do is I can hover over the we call them a transaction.
So I can hover over this transaction. I could just click reverse transaction. I confirm and then you'll see what it does is it basically reverses the time taken away from the account and adds it back.
So this is the best way to do it if you're trying to keep very clean, very clear records, right? So in this case, we have every step of the process is captured.
It was submitted by the trainee. It was approved by the administrator. And then it was reversed for whatever reason, so that it is no longer approved.
And we have that reversal locked as well. So this is a great way to do it when something has changed, that is.
It caused it to no longer you know, be requested. For some reason this doesn't need to happen anymore, so I can reverse it.
I have note, I have a record of that reversal, who did it and when, all that good stuff. So this is the ideal way to do it if you're trying to keep pretty meticulous records on this kind of thing.

Generating an individual document
Hi there. In this video, we're going over generating documents for an individual within metrics. So, in the previous videos on this module, we've been on the institution portal doing kind of all of the setup work.
But now that we're, it's time to actually create the document itself, or generate the document itself, , on the admin portal.
So, from the admin portal, right here in the right top right, we'll go to documents and then templates. And so, we've just got the two examples here.
You might have one document for your program. You might have many. It just depends on what you're using metrics for.
But we're going to use our employment contract. A template as an example here. So, click generate document. And a note here on this page is you will see a select academic period filter at the top.
So, when you create these documents, they will be tied to an academic period. And that's particularly helpful if you have, say, a resume.
Where each year you need to generate a new document for them for their employment as they go throughout the various levels of the training.
So, all this data will be tied to an academic period. So that's pretty handy. You can also, you know, look back in time if you want to see documents from earlier runs.
But you have two choices here. You can select a role to generate documents, a batch, or you can select an individual.
Ah, but from the role tab you can still work with an individual. So let's do that. We'll pick PGY2 here.
And so what this does is this pulls in all users. That match the PGY2 criteria. And so let's say I want to generate a document for Robert Chase.
So in earlier videos we added the first and last name fields to the merge field. So you can see those have already been filled in.
I don't even need to do anything with those because they're just pulling from system data. So that's pretty cool. And then to add the other fields, these are going to be select fields for me.
So I go to edit fields. I could pick a role to apply. So let's say this is actually for his next year.
So we'll pick PGY3. And then we'll pick the start date. So that would be probably like June 30th next year.
Right? Click save here. And you'll see now that I've filled in all the required merge fields. I have the option to create the document.
Click create document. And we're done. Now it exists. And we can download it. And take a look at it. And you'll see I've left mostly a templated text in here.
But where we've replaced the first name and last name, we now have Robert Chase. And we have down here, we've replaced the, ah, sturping.
And so that has also been replaced automatically through the, ah, document generation tool.

What rotations are available to schedule on a block schedule?
Hi there. In this video we're going to be talking about what rotations are going to be available to schedule on my block schedules.
So we'll actually have to take a little trip around metrics to talk about this topic in full, but the answer by default is all of them unless you take some kind of specific action.
So let's start by going to system setup and then rotations. And so the key thing to know here is that for a rotation to exist in metrics, it must be tied to a site.
And that's going to be the key concept here because the way you can limit what rotations appear on a block schedule is through the site.
And in a lot of cases, you actually probably don't want to bother, right? You just want to put everything on one block schedule and that's fine.
But there are cases where maybe you do want to limit what shows up on a block schedule. And that's where this concept of rotations being tied to.
Sites comes in. So if we now go to schedules and then we'll just pick either of these schedules here to edit, we're talking primarily about this section here, specify sites, right?
And so if I select nothing here, and that is the default, the default is no sites are specifically selected. That means that all rotations are available to use on this block schedule.
But if I select one or multiple here, then only rotations tied to these sites are going to be available to use on my block schedule.
So again, in. Any cases probably don't even bother. Just leave it empty. And in that case, you'll be able to do whatever, right?
Because all the rotations will be available. But in some cases, it is useful to limit what rotations can appear on the block schedule.
And that's when you want to use this section to define that. And the way to define that is through the rotations site.
That's it. For this video. Thank you for watching.

Applying a merge field to all users in a list
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about applying a merge field value to all users in a list while generating documents.
So that's probably going to make a lot more sense to you if you've been watching this series of videos I've done here for generating documents three users and metrics.
And so what you want to do is go to doc.com. Click on templates. And so in a previous video basically what we did is we selected this document to generate.
We picked pgy2. This pulls me a list of all the different users that match that criteria in my program. And then we generate a document for Robert Chase individually by going to the edit fields, picking the role, picking the start date for him, and then generating the document.
So while this is fine and works great, there's a lot of scenarios where, well, we're pretty much going to apply the same value to everyone in this list.
So let's say we're generating employment contracts for next year for all of our PGY2 residents. That means they're probably all going to be PGY2 residents.
So instead of going through each of these and then manually picking the role and start date, what we could do is we could apply a value to all.
So if I pick the merge field here. Then pick the role I want and click apply. This will add the pgy3 role to all my users in my list.
So instead of doing a one by one, I can do it. And the more users you have, the more useful this is.
And we could do the same thing with the start date as well. So once I do, I just click create document here, and there we go.
And so now we've created our document for this user as well, and we can go ahead and create our document. Go ahead and create documents for everyone else if we would like to.

What are requirements?
Hi there. In this video, we're going over the requirements module. Basically, what is it? So the requirements module is a pretty useful module in metrics.
Basically, it allows you to collect information from various users in your program for whatever purpose in a pretty organized manner.
So a really easy use case for requirements is during the onboarding of new trainees, something that you're probably doing on a yearly basis.
So the way requirements works at its most basic is if we look at requirements here on the left nav, we'll go to templates.
We can create a template that is basically requesting information. So for example, Hey, I need your immunization records. I can create a template and ask it to send that requirement to X amount of people by their role, by individual, by their group, whatever.
It doesn't make sense. And if I do that, those users will receive the request. They can then submit information to me, whether they just need to acknowledge seeing this thing, whether it need to actually like fill something out and submit it back to you, signed, whatever it might be, requirements module
can handle it. And so basically, you could see those assignments and then you will have the ability to approve or reject those requirements.
And if it's a requirement that says, yes, I need your immunization records, and once you approve it, it will automatically create a document within metrics tied to that user's profile.
So you just always get to get to those approved documents against the user profile, and you don't have to go add them there yourself.
So it's basically a streamlined way to do onboarding. You don't only have to use it during the start of the year.
Of course, there might be other times of the year. You just need to collect information from a set of people, and you don't want to play email tag with them.
You know, let the system do that. The system will remind them weekly of your other requirements that you still need to handle.
And then there are other bells and whistles here like expiration dates for requirements that end. Like, say, ACLS cards, right?
Gotta renew those all the time. That could automatically be handled through requirements. So it's ultimately a very useful module for collecting information from the users in your program without needing to play email tag with them.

How can I grant administrative access to a block schedule?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about granting administrative access to block schedules. Basically means I want someone else to be able to help me with doing stuff on this block schedule.
And so there's going to be two ways to do that. One is specific to certain block schedules And the other is more like an overall permission where people can have access to block schedules.
Access to all the block schedules in your program. So first let's talk about the one for specific block schedules. So if you go to schedules on your left nav here, you'll be taken to the block schedules tab.
And then this is where I have control down to the block schedule. So if I look at resident master schedule here, for example.
And I click on edit, there's going to be a section here. So specify sites, administrators, and then specifically the schedule administrators section.
So here we could see that Perry Cox already has admin rights over this specific block schedule. So that means that just like we can as administrators, we can play with the blocks.
We can play with who gets schedules what their dates are, all that stuff. They can do the same thing, but only for this specific block schedule.
So this is really good to use when it comes to say chief residents, right? They likely help you create these schedules, or maybe they're coming up the schedules themselves.
You can grant them access to do all the things you can do on a block schedule, but without having all the other tools that are available to you as a program admin, right?
Cause we don't necessarily want to grant them full admin rights. We just want them to be able to work with the schedule.
So you can search for a user here add them to that field and click save, and that will add them as a administration.
For this specific block schedule. But if you have a lot of block schedules and you want to grant someone edit rights to those all at once, then we could do that from here under system setup and permissions.
We can see we have some users that already have permissions here. So if a user already has permissions, you can just edit them.
And you can see in this case, John Doran already has calendar administrator rights, but I can grant him block schedule administrator rights.
And then from here, there's also two flavors view and edit. So there's other ways to grant people view access rights.
So probably you're only using this in very specific cases, but edit rights that this is how you grant that for multiple block schedules or effectively all block schedules in your program to a single person at a time.
This person that has edit rights over each of those. Block schedules. And if you don't have a user that already has permissions, you can just add them here, find them in the list here.
So let's say Cole, he needs a click select and then same thing, right? At block schedule. Administrator edit rights save.
And that will then create Cole's entry here. And if you ever need to change his permissions, click edit here, or just remove his permissions entirely, remove all permissions.
And there you go. That's that's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Making a benefit request on behalf of a user
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about making a benefit request on behalf of one of your users as an administrator.
So generally speaking, this is not something we recommend getting in the habit of. Just creates extra work for admins and you're already busy.
Ideally trainees will submit this kind of information and then you can try it out. Just focus on approving and rejecting it. But let's say that we have a reason to do this and a good one.
So in that case, let's go to benefits on the left now. Click time off. We'll use our user here, Alec Carav.
Open up his time off account and then we'll pick the type of account that we're gonna do. So let's say sick day.
He's out sick. We know that we don't want to make him log in and do this kind of thing. So we'll just take care of this and mark them out as a sick day.
So if I hover over the category name here all the way through, right, it says submit request on person's behalf.
So we can click on that and then basically this is the same as them filling it out on their side, just, we're doing it for them.
So go ahead and select category. Category is sick. Go to description. We'll give them a full day. Stay off here and click submit.
That will then take you to the request page automatically and you can go ahead and approve it and that's all there is to it.
So that is how you create a benefit request. For a user yourself and just take care of it yourself if for whatever reason that becomes a good thing to do.

Deleting an existing request as an admin
Hi there, in this video we're talking about how to delete an existing benefit request as an administrator. So this is not typically something that we recommend, we like to keep more thorough records of this kind of thing instead of just deleting them outright, but let's say for some reason we do have
a situation where a benefit request was mistakenly created, mistakenly approved, it really never should have happened and so let's just get rid of the whole thing, right?
So in those cases what you want to do is go to benefits on the left nav, go to time off, we'll use our entries on alicarev here, let's say there was a mistakenly vlog sickday or something like that, and what we can do is we can hover over that transaction so we can see here it was for November 23rd.
I do have this reverse button which I covered in another video. That's a good thing to use when it was correctly approved, but maybe it just didn't happen for some reason, we just want to reverse it.
But we want to keep a record of that reversal in the whole process, that makes sense. But in some cases it might be more appropriate just to delete the whole thing.
So in those cases you can click on view details here instead. And then on this pop-up we do have the delete request button.
Go ahead and hit that, confirm, and that request is then outright deleted.

Creating requirement templates
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss creating requirement templates, which is the first step in utilizing the requirements module.
So if we'll go to requirements on our left map from the program admin portal, then go to templates, we'll get a list of the currently existing templates, but let's go ahead and make a new one here.
So create new template in the top right. We'll give it a name. Let's say I'm trying to get your ACLS card.
I can also select a document category. And so this is something that's especially useful for requirements where you're actually collecting like a PDF or something like that, some kind of file attachment.
So in these cases, I select a document category and then whenever I approve one of the requirement assignments that comes from this template, it will automatically attach that submit a document as an attachment against the user's profile under this document category.
So very handy feature. For the description here, I can put whatever it is I need to put. This will be displayed to the individual when they attempt to submit the requirement.
They'll see all that information. Down here, I get to select who actually gets this requirement. So here I'm going to say this is going to apply to incoming residents.
So this is pretty typical. Oftentimes the requirement module is used when onboarding new trainees. So I have a special role for that, incoming residents.
And so this way it doesn't get assigned accidentally to like my current first year residents because I'm making all my new residents under the incoming resident role.
So roles is one way to do this. You can also do this with custom groups that you've created or you could just choose individuals if need be.
Down towards the bottom here we got some more options. So include document. So this is very handy if say there is a PDF template something that they need to fill out and just send back to you.
You can just give them that file as part of the actual requirement so they don't need to go looking somewhere else it'll just always be included with the requirement.
And then in scheduling here we get to choose either I can basically have this get sent out right away or I could choose a future date for which to be assigned.
So here I selected a future date and then I have a deadline that I can also assign that hey it must be done by this date.
Down here I also have my auto renewal. So this is a requirement that is going to expire. So when you're collecting things like licenses and certifications often those things will have an expiration date and then this system will actually be able to identify when that expiration date is, make a new requirement
for the user to submit the new version of that documents so this can serve as a reminder. Of getting those expiring documents renewed and we can set up exactly when we wanted to do that for this particular requirement.
So let's say ACL certification. I want to start reminding people about that 90 days before it expires. So just enter that value there.
And then we have a couple of other settings. This is to notify users about this requirement immediately. So if we turn this on, as soon as I click the save button, it's going to let people know that requirement exists.
At other times, you might want to turn this off and just let the system kind of handle it when it comes time to handle it.
The other options that we have here are requiring program administrators to complete this. So this is a case where we want to collect this thing through requirements, but maybe we already have it on file and I'm just adding it to metrics cases like that.
So we're doing it on beat. Half of our users. So that is if that's something you want this with the option you will want to turn on and then this option at the bottom here just requires them to submit this requirement while also selecting an expiration date.
So this is again a good example of that. I need your ACLS cards. Those things will have expiration dates so I'm not allowing this to fit it to me without selecting an expiration date.
So these are the various options that are available to you when you are creating a requirement in metrics.

Copying over a block schedule to the next academic year
Hi there. In this video we're going to be going over how to copy a block schedule over from one academic year to the next one.
And so to do that we're going to go to our block schedules page. So from the dashboard here we'll go to schedules from our left nav.
Block schedules are our default tab here. So this is where we want to be. And so this basically comes down to usually the structure of a block schedule.
It doesn't really change year to year unless you're changing something about your program. So in a lot of cases you will be able to just move the schedule over to the next year and it'll work fine.
Right? And so that's what this feature really takes advantage of. So if we look at our resident master schedule here and we look at the structure, right?
So the structure is really about the blocks. So the blocks in this case are just monthly blocks that we applied to all of 2022.
Through 2023 here, ah, for our academic year that is from July 1st, 2022 to June 30th, 2023. And basically I want to do the same thing for next year.
So instead of going through the whole process of, ah, hey, let's make a new black schedule, let's apply the blocks, we can just do that with a couple of clicks.
Right. So in line with the, ah, black schedule here, click on the actions button, then click duplicate. And so basically all you need to do is pick next academic year.
So in this case, we're moving it to 2020. 23, 24. So I picked that academic year, I click duplicate. And so now if I go next year, I'll see there's already a black schedule here.
And so you there's no one on it yet because I haven't added any users to it, but the structure is here.
So instead of going through the process each year and you know, making the block schedules manually. And especially if you have made the blocks manually because you follow a very specific schedule, then you don't need to redo that.
Just duplicate it over to the next year. We don't follow this super standardized calendar in life. You know, months have different amounts of days.
Not every day falls on the same day of the week every year. So things like that do matter. So, but this is still going to be way faster.
So if you go to manage blocks here, you can see that there's a lot of things that you can do to manage blocks.
You can still edit this as you need to. So say if you do like, Oh our, our blocks always start on a Monday, the first Monday of the month or something like that, then it's probably easier to still duplicate it moving forward to the next academic year and then make manual edits to the dates
. It will still save you some time. Thanks for watching. That's the end of this video.

Manually filling in information on generated document
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about manually filling in or editing information on an already generated document.
So we'll go to the left nav here, go to documents and then templates. Employment contract template, this is what we've been using.
In our video series we'll go to pgy2 and we can see these two documents that we've already generated. So this may not be available for you.
So this is an option that is added to the template that allows it to be edited after the fact once it has already been.
So to do this you might have this edit document button. If you don't have the button that means it's not enabled for that type of document.
But we can go ahead and click edit document and so you can see here I can actually now go in and edit this text.
Just with this document editor. So I've already applied the merge field values so you can see the first name, last name, and start date is already here.
But let's say, oops, I actually meant to do a different date here. Let's make it July 1st. Right? This is what it should be instead of June 30th and we need to change it.
But I've already generated the document. I don't want to delete it and et cetera. Right? And there might be other use cases for something like this, but basically can come in here to this document editor, make the change, click save.
Document. And now we have changed the document. When we download it, we'll see that it contains our changes.

Adding Rotation schedules to a block schedule
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about adding rotation schedules for your trainees or other users onto a block schedule.
So at this point we've done all the block schedules set up and now it's time to actually get those rotation schedules on there.
So I'm on the dashboard right now but to do this we'll go to schedules on the left nav and we'll default.
To block schedules here which is where we want to be. In this case I'm actually going to go back one academic period here because I'm going to work with these first.
So adding rotation schedules to a block schedule. I'm just going to pick one of these and there's going to be two ways to do this.
In this video we're going over doing it manually effectively through the there's also a way to do it with what is effectively an Excel or CSV import which we'll go over in another video.
But for now I'll click on this block schedule here. And so again I've already created the structure, I've already added the different users that I want to be on here, so all that matters now is actually making the block schedules.
So we'll use Alec Carro. Here you can see he already has some schedules here in this first block for July 2022.
So if I want to edit any of those I could just hover over the block, click edit, and then I see each of these.
I can also change the date ranges if I need to. And now I might get other warnings, right? So in this case I would create not a duplicate, but an overlapping rotation schedule.
There are reasons you may want those. There are reasons you may not want those. So you're going to want to do that.
Refer to your own program's way of doing things. But we will show you a warning if you're about to make one of those.
So I'll say, okay, in this case, the change has been saved. And now I'm left with two other block schedules here, right?
But let's move on and start making additional block schedules. So if I hover over any of these empty blocks, click edit.
I'll just be left with this. So basically I'm going to pick a rotation and then I'm going to set the dates.
So if your rotation schedules also follow your blocks. Schedule structure, then you're not going to have much to do here other than pick the rotation.
Right. So I'm going to say, ah, clinic. It goes from August 1st to August 31st, just like the blocks schedule itself does this specific block.
Click add. And that's it. I'm done now. Right. That's. That's all there is to it. So I can move on to the next block if I want and do the same thing.
And there we go. So if your schedule's. Basically follow the block structure, you're going to be in for a pretty easy time.
Just kind of picking the rotation and the user and that's it. But in some cases, maybe you don't follow that time or it changes for a couple of certain rotations, things like that.
Right? So let's keep going here. To October. And so let's say I have ENT, but for that I only have them on there for two weeks.
So we could quickly use these toggle and date functions here to switch that. So you could see two weeks from that date is the 14th.
Do that, right? Or if it's more specific than that, if it's, well, it's kind of like two weeks, but not quite, I can pick, say the 16th, if that's actually when that one ends, right?
So you could use the calendar pickers here to quickly change. Change that if one of the like easy to use toggle and date functions here, it doesn't quite get it right.
And then the last thing I want to talk about here is this optional suffix. So it's optional for a reason.
For most rotations, you probably won't have a specific reason to use it. So just feel free to leave it blank.
But basically what this this will do is anytime we show this rotation on a box schedule view, it's just going to add a little like message to the end of it.
So this is typically used in cases where let's say you're doing like a wards rotation. So there's only one rotation for it in metrics.
But in reality, it's kind of split up between teams. Like there's team one team, two team, a team B and sometimes it's good to know what team a resin is on.
So that's a good use case for using this suffix like that. And so basically, if you look at this, you'll see it says ENT, but now it says also dash team one.

Assigning requirement templates
Hi there. In this video we're going over how to assign our requirements. So, if we go to requirements on the left nav, then go to templates.
I already have a few templates here from the past. If you have created a template but did not set the assignment rules, you can come back here and set the assignment rules later.
But in this case we're just going to make a new one from scratch. Let's say I'm going to collect ACLS certifications from everyone.
And then here I'm going to pick the document category. So remember that, If we that are submitted by people to satisfy these requirements, if we approve them, they will automatically be linked to their account, to their profile, and they will be under this category.
So that's why it's important to pick a correct one. So in this case, it's an ACLS certification, so there's a solid chance that it's something like.
My incoming residence, right? I'm collecting this from them as they first start the program. And then down here, this scheduling portion is where I determine basically when this gets sent out.
So I have two choices. I can set a date here, in which case, umm. It will happen on that date.
So if I set this for a future date, in the morning on that date, the system will send out those requirements.
So you can set this up ahead of time. The other choice I have is to just save it right now, in which case it will just make the requirements right now.
So let's, I'm gonna do that for the sake of this video. We're gonna leave this blank. We're gonna set a end date.
For the end of the year, like this. And then, I'll click save. And it's basically asking me to confirm, because with the setup as it is, it will assign the requirements right now.
And so that's what I want. So I will click yes, assign the requirements. It's doing its thing. And now, you'll notice something.
Here as well, I can no longer delete this requirement because now there's assignments made against it. So if we go to requirements and the assignments page, we can see the two recent requirement assignments that I made.

Emailing generated documents for users
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about sending an email through metrics to give a user's generated document to them.
So to do so, we'll go to documents on the left nav, go to templates. We've been working with this employment contract template, so we'll Thank you very much.
Generate document. We'll locate our users. They've been under the page of what to roll here. And then now for these users that I've already generated documents for, you can see we have this send email button.
So if we click this, basically we're sending an email from metrics. To this person, so we don't need to enter their email.
We already know who they are. We have their email metrics. Here's your appointment contract. So this is their subject line.
So that's subject line. This is the body of the email. So whatever you would like to do. So right here, your body of the email here.
Sure. Okay. And then we can choose our recipients. So we can add this particular user here. They're gonna get this email, but we can also add other users that are located in metrics.
So if there is a particular person, perhaps on your HR department or something like that, that should be copied on these, you can also just tag them in here like so click send document.
You'll have this all copied. Information here. And if you do that, we will send an email to those people with an attachment containing this document.
Thank you.

Benefits "Off today" dashboard widget
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk a little bit about something that's actually on the dashboard for a change is the off-today widget.
So this is something that's available, not only on administrator dashboard, but it's also available in most cases on personal portal dashboards.
So this is particularly handy if you have a lot of people who don't know. In metrics, obviously your trainees. And they can just see if someone is off on vacation, out sick, or something like that without having to really ask anyone as it's an approved benefit request.
So we could see here for today, November 23rd, and this widget will default to the current day. So you don't really need to touch it just to see the current day stuff.
And we can see that the following individuals are off today. Alec is out today. He's out sick. We only have him for one day, so we should probably expect him to be back tomorrow.
And that's really all there is to it. It just lets you know who is off today and maybe gives you a little bit more information about that.
You can also check out our YouTube channel. I'm going to change the date on here so I can check tomorrow for instance.
So for tomorrow we have no one with an off date that we know of at this point. Go back to today and we get Alec again.
So this is just a really easy way to tell who's around today. If they're not on here, they're probably around in some capacity.

Create MSPE Template
Hi there. In this video we're going over how to create an MSP template in Metrix. Now creating an MSP in Metrix actually utilizes one of our more general features called Documents.
This can also be used to generate things like employment agreements and that kind of thing. But it can also be used to generate an MSPE and we've done a number of special things just for MSP generation to help accomplish that.
So, to create your MSP document you will want to be on the institution portal. So creating the template for the document is only done through the institution portal.
Users on the program portal can manipulate things about generated MSPEs but they can't actually touch the template itself. So, once you're on the institution portal, go to Documents, Templates, and you'll see here that we have a couple of existing examples and we'll look at those in a second, but we'll
walk you through the basics of creating the MSPE template. So, create the new template here. Template setup, we're just going to give this a name like MSPE 2025, something like that.
Program, in most cases you're only going to have one program to select from, so it's not going to matter much.
Roll So, this again does not have a huge effect on the MSPE because MSPE has a special way that we generate it for users, so you don't really need to set this technically speaking, but might be good just for purposes as to keep everything aligned to, say, pick MS4s.
And then an important part here is selecting the appropriate document category. So this is just for the database to, once the document is generated, so that it links to the appropriate category.
So it's easy to find later, basically. So if you haven't already made a document category for MSP specifically, we would recommend doing so and selecting it here.
And then down here, this again is not actually all that important for MSPE, because the assumption is if a user should be seeing the MSPE generation process, then they would be okay to edit it.
So this is for our more typical document generation process, but you can go ahead and just leave this as yes, as everyone will have that permission.
Go to save and continue. And then this will be an important part here. So this is selecting merge fields to add to the system.
So one of the things that Metrix does is it takes information in the system, a really easy one to think about is things like first name, right?
And by selecting that and then later adding it to the template, we can tell, we tell the system anywhere where we reference this merge field first name to take the first name of the user that you're generating for and place it there.
So if you're familiar with things like mail merge and tools like that, this works a lot like that except instead of working like working with an Excel file, you're working with the metrics database.
So obvious ones there are things like first and last name. And then this will also contain a number of other uhm other things as well as custom fields that you make that will address another video.
But let's just keep this super simple for now. First name and last name we'll add as merge fields and then go on to making the template.
Now what the system is doing here is creating the template. And now we can add content to the template. So as you can see here we have a whole document editor.
Right? So this has a lot of different features and functions that I'm not going to go into specifically. But if you're familiar with using things like Microsoft Word.
Or you've used this in other parts of our system you should be pretty familiar with this. So there are a lot of different formatting options that you can apply.
And edit right here in this document editor. It is also possible to paste in from an existing document. Document that you have in Word or something like that, but be aware that that could lead to formatting issues that you might need to fix.
So we cannot guarantee that every single document ever generated in Microsoft Word will paste in. It depends on a lot of factors, but you'll probably save some time pasting it and fixing it up versus writing it all out again.
So I'm just going to do a really simple example here where we add custom fields. So custom fields, or these merge fields, to the merge field template.
So the easiest way to do this is by inserting the merge field here. So I'll just type something, something, I'm very creative, something.
And then if I save it. Select first name as the merge field to insert, click add merge field, you'll see what it does there.
This is the format for adding these merge fields into the system. So there's a curly bracket, hashtag, name. Name of the field, oops, and then the closing curly bracket there.
And so if you do that, that's going to tell the system anytime it's uhm generating a document for a user, place the user's first name here, and of course you could do the same thing with last name.
Now the cool thing about this is even though this is kind of like a a helper where it helps you format the merge fields properly, you can also just take these and you can you can paste this text.

Viewing benefit requests on your calendar
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about how you can review an individual's updates through your administration calendar. So I'm here on the program administration portal.
We're gonna go to calendar on our left nav and approved benefit requests show up in a couple of different places throughout the system and we'll have a series of videos that talks about these, but this one's pretty simple.
We're looking at our program calendar for the day and we're taking advantage of a feature that we have that's also useful for other things and that's the ability to overlay an individual's calendar onto your own.
So in this case, I happen to know that Alec is off today. So I can go here, look up someone.
I can see their schedule, so this includes information like what rotation they're on, any calendar events they're invited to, whether those be conferences or their shift schedule for the day or something like that.
And I can see here, usually represented in this black, that he's out sick today. And so I can just identify that from the calendar.
And this is also how it displays on their own personal calendar. So when they go look at their calendar in metrics, they will see their off time, whether it be sick, vacation time, or anything like that.
Represented in this way on their calendar as well. And of course, this is available on all the different views too.
So, week view, month view, list view, etc. It will appear on all of them.

Preserving historical data on a block schedule
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about how to preserve historical data on a block schedule, which is really just a fancy way of saying how do I make sure that as my trainees advance in their roles and metrics that their schedules aren't affected and I can still go back and see them.
So let's look at the block schedules page to talk about this a little more. So I'm going to go to schedules here.
Block schedules tab is our default, so we're good there. And you can see that under the block schedule users will typically be added to block schedules using their roles, right?
And this kind of has an inherent problem because people people will not always be these roles. So you can say at page one, two, three, four here, but eventually people are going to become like alumni, right?
And so they're no longer going to match the rules of the schedule and therefore will no longer show up on the schedule.
So that's why we've added this little function here. So if we go we'll have a look at edit at the very bottom of the schedule.
This is checkbox that says, this is scheduled from past academic year. So you won't really have to touch this at all yourself.
The system does this and we'll enable this field. When the academic year has come to an end. So you could see here, the end of the academic year is June 30th, 2023.
So that means July 1st, 2023, when I come in here, this is going to be checked automatically. And the reason it does that is to try to keep a historical record of anyone that had a schedule stays on here.
Regardless of if they become an alumni or let's say they graduated, then came back later and became a physician at your program.
Right? So these are all possibilities. We want to make sure that when we go back and look at a schedule from years ago, it still looks the same way as when we made it.
And so that's why we have this function. So I'm going to use this manually to, to show you what's going to happen automatically at the end of an academic year.
So you can see here right now, users are added to this schedule by being part of one of these roles.
So if I go down here, or if I go back here and click on the schedule, we could see all the users on here.
Are going to match one of those roles. You'll see that some users actually do have schedules while others don't. So like Carlos here, he doesn't actually have a schedule on here.
He just happened to be added because he matched the role. Right? And so. So what's going to happen is when this is triggered, all of the users that are currently added as roles are going to be added as individuals to the schedule.
So they're never going to come off of the schedule. So, and then people that don't actually have a schedule on the block schedule, they're not.
They're not going to show up anymore because there's nothing to show. So you can see what's going to happen is all those users that actually have schedules, they're going to end up here because they can be added as individuals to the schedule.
So I'm going to check this box. So again, normally this would happen. It's going to happen automatically. You can see the roles have been removed and the number of people has dropped significantly because only a few people actually had schedules on this schedule in our little test environment here
. And so that, that's what's happening in that case. And this is what we'll have. It's going to happen automatically. So you might see the numbers change, right?
About how many schedules or how many users are on your schedule. And that's going to be because, well, not all those people actually had a schedule on the block schedule.
They just happened to show up there. And if we look under edit, we'll see that those use. Those users show up as individuals on the schedule.
And if for some reason this happened and you need to go back and add something or, or whatever situation came up, you can always come here, turn this off.
Right? And then you'll be back to working with this like any other schedule. So if I want to. Add back those roles, be to one, one, two, three, save it again.
They're all back here and I can work with them again. Right? But all the people that previously didn't actually have schedules showed back up.

Deactivating/reactivating/deleting requirement templates
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about deactivating, reactivating, and deleting requirement templates. So to do so, we'll go to requirements on the left nav, go to templates, and so you'll see here that we have a number of templates that already exist.
You might notice that none of them have a delay. We have option, which means that all of these have data tied to them.
But first, let's talk about deactivating and reactivating and kind of what that means. So for example, I have this ACLS certification, and we have auto-renew turned on for the requirement.
That means the system is going to try to look at what documents are expiring and when, and then when it hits a threshold that is set on the template, which in this case is 90 days, once that threshold is hit, it will assign a new requirement for the user whose document is expiring.
So if we don't want that to continue, all we have to do is deactivate it. All of the previous data tied to that requirement, nothing changes, it's all still there, but it's not going to be taking that action anymore.
If we ever need to basically bring that back, we can go to the inactive tab and I can then reactivate that requirement by doing that here.
If I go back to the active tab, we'll see that it is now here again. Now that handles activating or deactivating and reactivating, now let's talk about deleting.
So you will not be allowed to delete requirements that have data associated with them, so that data is basically requirement assigned.
So if we do want to actually take an action of deleting the requirements, that probably means we may have done something mistakenly and we kind of want to take it back.
So what we would do in that case is, this is the ACLS certification, so we'll go to assignments, we can filter by that particular requirement, filter down, we can see that there are 4 results for that.
I can delete all of these, and once those are deleted, I will now be allowed to delete the requirement template that they came from.
So simply click delete and confirm, and then that requirement template will also be deleted.

Create Custom fields
In this video, we're going to discuss utilizing and creating custom fields and metrics to be put on the MSPE. So, you may already be familiar with custom fields and metrics.
There are plenty of other uses for them. There are outside of the MSPE specifically, but basically what they are is an extra kind of demographic type field that you can apply against a user.
To identify users preferred t-shirt size even. Really it's for anything where we don't have a standard field for it, but you need to track it and perhaps include it in some document that you generate.
So, in order to do this you will also need to be in the institution portal, so you can go there, system setup, custom fields, and you'll see here a number of categories that you can create for the purposes of custom fields as well as you know, anything else really, or for the purposes of FSPE as well
as for anything else. So we could add a new category here just for the sake of it, so add a new category.
Our new category will appear down here and then we can add fields to it. So in terms of MSPE. Usually the best thing to do is to add a uhm text fields.
Text fields tend to do the best, it takes a lot of work out of some things in terms of data validation.
As we have many clients that have users enter it directly in the system, there are clients that have it added via integrations from other databases that just push the data over to metrics as well as we have our own user upload process that you could use to update these demographic fields for users.
So those are all possible and text is the easiest way to go because then you don't have to do any validations against the different answer choices that might appear, but we can go quickly over those types as well.
So we're just going to call this custom field number 20 because I probably already have a custom field number 1 somewhere.
And then we have our types. For the purpose of MSPE, short and long text. So we're going to call this custom field number 20 because I probably already have a custom field number 1 And then we're going to call this custom field number because I probably already have number 1 somewhere.
So in our case for MSPE, it would be student. And then we have one more field for for allowing users to fill out their own answer for this field.
So this is something that we added specifically for MSPE. Of course, you could use it for other things, but we utilize this.
For noteworthy characteristic collection, where students are able to go to their profile and just enter their noteworthy characteristics as opposed to submitting it somewhere else for you to enter it onto their MSPE.
It could just be pulled in as a merge field. But for this one, let's just leave it as custom field number 20.
And then we'll do, Let's do another example here just for the other type, so we'll just call this multiple choice, custom type, select one, right, so multiple choice is pick from one of many, then we have another option here for select multiple, that's like a checklist not often utilized for MSPE, but
perhaps one day, so we'll have a use case for that, so if we just do a multiple choice question, then we can add the different answer choices here, I'll keep it simple, one, two, three, four.
But this can also be directly added to the MSPE if necessary, these answers, so if you have a case where, you know, you want to be strict about what could be entered into the field, then you can use this as a way to accommodate.
So I've seen obvious uses for this as well as ways to actually have structured sentences be added into the MSPE by way of selection of multiple custom fields, so there's a lot of ways that this can be utilized.
Oh, well, you actually have to select the user type there, thank you system for reminding me. There we go. And now we've created the multiple choice custom field.
And so as you create these, these are automatically created as merge fields, which you can then add against the templates when you go to edit them and go to the manage merge fields section.
So you could do this at any point in the process. Really, you could create a new custom field, add it as a merge field, but remember adding it as a merge field is not the only thing you need to do.
You then also need to make sure you add it to the content of the actual, uhm, document as well. So, you'll need to stick it into the document somewhere in order for that data to be pulled in and displayed on the generated document.

Viewing benefit requests on block schedule simple views
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about viewing benefit requests on the various block schedule views. So if we go to schedules on our left nav here, we have our block schedule and we've we can click on it.
We have the view button and then we have the simple view button. So I'm looking at this through the app.
We have them portal, but these views are also available for personal portal users. If you've given them the appropriate permissions or given them the link for the simple view.
So let's take a look at this real quick. I'll click on the name of the schedule brings up and we see our example right here.
So, Alex. He is on the clinic rotation for the month of November here. We can see he's also got an entry for some sick time for November 23rd.
So easy way to tell if it's a benefit request is if it shows up in red as described in the legend on the five schedule here.
It's definitely a benefit request. And the other thing to note here is that benefit requests will only show up on these block schedule views if it has been approved.
So pending a request don't show up here, only approved ones do. And this is also true of the simple view here, so I'm just going to jump in.
I'm going to jump to that real quick. And so this is basically the same information, the only difference is this page is publicly accessible if you have distributed the URL to the page.
Anyone with the URL can view it assuming that your program has set up permissions for that kind of thing, but it really just looks the same.
The only difference is it's a different view and it's available to those that also might not have full access to metrics in general.
So this is a good thing to send out to say like nursing staff, it's good for them to know who's where, but maybe they don't actually need an account in metrics.

what does a requirement assignment look like to a non admin?
Hi there. In this video we're talking about what a requirement assignment looks like to someone viewing it on their personal portal.
So I'm logged in as one of my incoming residents in this case. And you can see it's a pretty bare not much going on for this user.
But if I go to requirements on my left nav, I'll see the view that I have two requirements to complete here.
And over time, if they receive more things like the search function here, or the status filter here, will be more useful.
But right now there's just these two, and they have both in the status incomplete. And this view defaults to the view incomplete, because that's kind of what we want to show people.
Uhh, so ACLIS certification here, let's go ahead and click complete. And this is the basics of it. Uhh, so they're gonna get some information about the requirement, what it is, what the due date is, what program it was assigned by, if there's any description.
What about how they should fill it out, or any other information that might be useful to them that you input when you created the requirement template that will show up here.
And then if there are any attachments, that will show up here as well. Uhh, so in this case, uhh, it's just an image of an ACLIS card.
So nothing too crazy, but they can click on that and see that. Umm, that attachment, whatever has been provided. And then down here, you can see they have the ability to attach a file to submit the requirement.
If that's necessary for the requirement, it may not be. They have the ability to add an identification number, so if the identification number is something that this particular requirement requires, then they can add it here, and that could be part of your review as you approve it.
You can see there's also an expiration and renewal date. This can be made required per template if it's an item that we know has an expiration date and we really need them to add one.
When they submit it, we can make this a required field when we create the template. And lastly, there are the notes and comments.
So if there's anything else they want you to know, something to consider during your review of the requirement, they can add that here, and you can review that as you review the requirement.

Understanding Reports on Block Schedules 📊
Hello there. In this video we're going to talk about reporting on the data from within block schedules and other words, rotation schedules and kind of how to look at that data in other parts of the system.
So we're going to focus on reports on the left nav here and then the schedule tab. And so there are a number of reports here that can be utilized that could be helpful, but I'm specifically going to go over the site rotators report, the site survey report, and this block schedule audit report.
So let's, let's get right into it. So site rotators is probably the one that's going to be the most useful over time.
And this very simply just shows you all people's rotations. It's a report that you can download. It says this person is going to this site.
This. Time and date, right? That's what this says. There's also the ability to overlay shift schedules which is going to be part of another set of videos.
So, but most importantly, you can filter this page down to whatever you want. So if we only want to look at this.
Month, we can do that. If we want to go back many years or since the start of this year, we can do that and it'll pull those schedules for me once here.
I can also just download them as an Excel. For instance, and it will download that pretty quickly here. And then I can export this out of metrics and do whatever it is I need to do with it.
And you'll see that when you do that, we also get some additional information that could be helpful for you when you are dealing with an export of this data and metrics.
So the site rotators report is really your best bet for just getting all the information about. Your rotation schedules out of metrics.
But there are a couple of other reports that have releases. So if we go to reports schedules, again, we're going to talk about block schedule audit here.
And so basically what this shows you is when and who made changes to your block schedules over time. So if it's just you making schedules, you're responsible for the schedule.
You're probably not going to use this too much. But if you have your chiefs in there, there are other coordinators in there always making edits to the schedule.
This could be. Pretty useful to see who did what and when. So you can see the different types of edits that were made.
These are additions. These are edits to existing. There are deletions. And so you can keep track of all this. So it's, it's what it says it is.
It's an audit log. Any time a rotation schedule gets touched in metrics, either created, edited, or deleted. And just like with the site rotators report, you can quickly, ah, download this to an Excel if you need to get it out of the system.
Or you can use these various, ah, date filters at the top to narrow down what it is you're looking. Looking for.
So maybe you're only looking for changes made to a specific person, or you know a change was made, ah, dealing with certain site.
You could filter down to only those results and then download. What you need to. And, ah, based on the filter, the Excel download also respects that.
So if I, if I filter down to an individual, I'm only going to see that individual's records in the, ah, actual Excel.
And so let's just pull that up real. Real quick. So not going to be, ah, terribly exciting here, but it's an Excel and it pulls that information out of the system along with, again, some, some more information that's not necessarily shown in the, ah.
HTML page, the front end view of the report. And then lastly, we're going to talk about site survey. So this one is kind of a unique report and we built it specifically for dealing with like let's say that something has happened at a particular site of yours and you need to know exactly who is there
and how you can get in contact with them to check on them. Right? So for any number of reasons, you might need to do that.
So what you could do with this is just pick a date. So I'm going to go back to July 1st and then, in this case, although you would probably run this with current date, right?
Just so I have some data and I'm going to pick all my sites just to make sure I get data.
But what this will do, this will download a report like this and, so I can see when where my people are, so their sites and also their contact information.
So that's going to be the important part here is you'll be able to quickly get in touch with them if you need to.
To figure out, hey you know, something happened. I need to get a head account. I need to get in touch with people to be able to confirm if they're okay.
Right? So for various reasons, you might need to do that. And so this report can be very helpful in doing that.

Create document categories for MSPE
Hi there. In this video we'll be discussing creating document categories within the context of MSPE. So you might already be familiar with creating document categories as there's plenty of reasons to have them outside of MSPE.
It's just a good way to organize any kinds of documents that you might need to attach to users in the system or sites or programs or any number of things.
But in the case of MSPE there are a few different document categories that you should create ahead of time. To make sure that our system has a place to put these things once it generates them.
So to create document categories you want to go to the institution portal. Go to system setup, customize. And then it will actually be the first option here, document types.
So why do we need document types for MSPE? The reason is we're going to generate some data in metrics. We're going to have the MSPE document itself.
And we're going to have images that we generate in metrics. Those are going to be images of things like charts.
So when we look at a bunch of grades in metrics, we identify how the student performed against the cohort, and we generate some kind of chart.
Based around that, we need a place to put it so that we can go find it later and place it on the MSPE document automatically when we generate the document.
So that's what these are for. So you can see I have one for MSPE. I have one for our competency quartile.
I have our GPA quartile type chart and so on. So, creating these is very simple. Go to document types, new document type, type in MSPE.
Type the name new MSPE document category. Right? There we go. And I do have some options here and you don't really need to use any of these for the purposes of MSPE.
It should be fine to leave them all blank. So I've created that new document category and now I can utilize this in different parts of the system, most likely when creating the MSPE template.
Or when creating charts.

When to Designate a Rotation Schedule as Primary 🤔
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about when to designate a rotation schedule as primary. So on this subject we're basically talking about overlapping rotation schedules.
So to see an example of that we're going to go to schedules, look at our block schedule, and I've set up a few scenarios here.
So let's take a look at Carlos. And so the whole reason that you would even think about setting a rotation schedule as primary is because you are trying to tell the system what we want to report for our IRIS reporting purposes.
So basically for the dates that we have a rotation schedule marked as primary, So that's what we are going to do.
Is what we're going to show on the iris report and we're not going to show the other ones. So we have an interesting case here for Carlos so you could see that there are three total rotations within this block and we have one day of overlap where all three rotations are happening.
At this you may consider that oh I should mark one of these as primary but there's an interesting caveat here.
Iris reporting is done by site right and you can see here that all three of those rotations actually occur at the same site metrics hospital northeast so it's actually necessary to mark any of these as primary because our IRIS reporting will just combine them together because they're at the same site
There's no issue with that and that just makes it easier on you However, there are situations where perhaps you have a resident that's going to be doing a rotation at a different site at the same time.
So you can see that there's also a warning that displays when you're about to create an overlap. In many cases there is no need to create overlapping rotations, but there are legitimate ones as well.
So I'll go ahead and click Save there. And so now I have a situation where I have the user on two rotations at the same site, but then also on a different rotation at another.
Site. So this is a case where I might want to use the primary setting. So it depends on what we want to report within IRIS, but if we want to consider that this rotation at dermatology is what should be reported, we would then mark that as the primary rotation.
So because that occurs at metrics hospital, Northeast. It's going to combine these two, clinical dermatology, and consider that our record that we're going to put in iris.
However, if we mark this one here, this Metrotasboro North, it's going to do a couple of things differently on the iris report.
Make sure that these two schedules cut off on July 30th and then this one that is marked as primary gets set as the schedule that happened on July 31st.
So this is more of a nuance thing you may want to get additional guidance from your GME office or whoever handles the IRIS reporting at your institution for exactly how you should treat certain scenarios.
But effectively, this is just a way to make sure you are reporting on your IRIS support exactly what you want to be on there, regardless of how you may have used the rotation schedules and metrics to maybe do something special with how you assign evaluations.
And interact in certain ways that you may not want represented on your IRIS report.

How can my users submit a requirement
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about how your users that have been assigned requirements can actually submit them.
So I am currently logged in as a incoming resident and I've got a couple of requirements to submit so I will go to requirements on my left nav, I can see the different requirements.
So if I come here I can see details about the requirement up top, so if there's something a little more complex or things they might be aware of, you'll probably want to add something to the description of the requirements so they can have a read on that if it's something that's not so obvious.
You can also add attachments here, if there's like a form they need to fill out or something like that they can do so here.
And then down here is where they actually submit the requirement, so if it's something that comes along with a an actual file, they can upload that here, as well as they can upload any kind of identification numbers for, so for things like licenses and certifications, these can be pretty handy.
We also have an expiration or renewal date here which I've made required for this particular requirement. And then any notes or comments that we want, whoever's going to be reviewing the requirements submission to be able to see.
So I'll just go ahead and add an identification number, I'll set a renewal date for the end of next year, and then I'll add some very useful comments here.
There we go. That'll really help the administrator. So now that I hit save, I have submitted the requirement and it is now in a state called pending review.
So this has now gone to an administrator that has access to these programs requirements and they can now review it and decide if it meets the criteria and approve it or if it doesn't, they can reject it and the user can attempt to upload it again with corrections.

Summary benefit report
Hi there. In this video we're talking about different reports that are available for our benefits module, so to see them we'll go to reports on our left nav, across the top here we're going to have a tab for benefits, go ahead and click that, and we have two reports here.
In this video we're going to focus on the summary, and so the summary is pretty simple, we're not interested in the, let's say, full details of each individual request, here I'm just looking to get a count, right, I'm going to pick a date range, and I'll go pretty wide here, just get some good data out
of it, and I just want to know how many days off of the different types that everyone has, right, I'm not interested in all the details of all the things, I just need a summary report, so add your date range, select your role, click the download report button, open that up, and here we go, so basically
, for each of my users, I can see how many days off they have. For each of the available categories for my programs, and then also the total all time will show up here.
So this is just a really fast way to get this information in a summary view.

Why can't I delete a block schedule?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about deleting block schedules and why you may not be able to, and in that case for good reason.
So to have a look at this we're going to go to schedules on the left nav. We're under block schedules already here, and we're under block schedules already here, and we're under block schedules already here, and we're these block schedules.
So, and then doing show, show you how to. So in line with the block schedule, click on actions, then click on delete.
You're going to get a confirmation, confirmation message for deleting the schedules. Click yes. You'll see we're going to be denied here because there are active user schedules still on this block schedule.
So what that means is if I go look at this, you'll see that this block schedule has been used. And so this is a concept that we have in metrics, which is basically protected data.
And these rotation schedule. In order to delete the block schedule, you must take the action of deleting these rotation schedules from underneath it.
Right. So you cannot delete a block schedule. Unless it's basically empty. And that's for good reason, because if you go around deleting rotation schedules like this, it could mess up other parts of your data, because rotation schedules form the backbone of a lot of different things and metrics.
So we want to be very careful with deleting those. However, if you have a rotation schedule, or in this case, a block schedule that doesn't have any rotation schedules on it, you are actually free to delete that.
And usually these are made by accident, maybe, you know, lack of communication in some case, and duplicate got made or something like that.
So in these cases, just click on actions, delete. And that one's gone because there was nothing on it. And that's it.
That's how you delete a block schedule. So that's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Detailed benefit report
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about one of the reports that could run for our benefits module, the detailed benefit report.
So we'll go to reports on our left nav, we can click on benefits on the tab up here, and we'll see the two different benefits reports that we offer.
So we went over the summary in a different video. It's, it's what it is. Not a lot of detail, just overall counts.
How many days off did people have under which categories? It's as simple as that. This report, however, the account request report basically gives me full information.
So if I just want to see, show me every single benefit entry from January 2020 through the end of basically right now, show me all the different types or of course I can select other types to show me as well, only show me the approved ones, only show me the rejected ones, and so on.
And I can also pick from my category. So in this case, I just want the whole thing. I want all the data from all time.
And so I can hit the download button like that, grab my Excel, and then so here I get the full information.
So who made the request, what days it was for, the duration, what category it was, what status it's in, as well as any kind of comments that are made available.
Under the request. So this is a good way to get full data out of the system whereas the summary report is a good way just to get some counts together of how many days off do people have when you're not interested in the full details.

Create Charts
Hi there, in this video we're discussing creating charts for your MSPE. Now our chart creation tool allows for a good bit of customization, but there are certain types of charts that you might want to utilize.
So, to create charts and metrics, you want to be on the administration portal, go to documents, charts, and then you'll see here we've already created a few charts just so we can kind of show what the idea is, so one of the types of charts that we have is competency core tiles.
Once charts are generated, you can also preview the charts. You can see here this is the core competency tile chart that we have generated for Deborah Adams.
And ah what we do with this is once these charts are generated, we can then insert them into the MSPE as they are being generated.
So that's that's the whole idea is that we can generate these charts beforehand, we have the image files ready, and then when you generate the MSPE, we place them in the document wherever you've put their merge field.
So this is the competency quartile chart, one you might make use of. This is the course specific chart, which is often utilized for ah core clinical rotations, where you can compare the ah student, the MSPS4, with the rest of the cohort, in this case Deborah Adams had a ah status of honor for her OB
rotation, and we could see how that compares to the rest of the cohort. And then this could be generated for multiple rotations at a time as well.
Next we have our GPA chart. GPAs are actually stored in what we call an exam score. There will be another video on that that you can find.
But if we preview that, we'll see. It's again another quartile chart, but it's just the one value instead of the competency chart, which was I believe six.
So that's why it looks the way it does. And then these two at the bottom are the same type of chart.
These are the aggregate quartiles. And this is where you're trying to do one chart, but it has a bunch of different courses on it.
And so that'll come out looking something like this. And of course it all depends on how many courses you add to the chart, how many different grade statuses your organization might have.
But that is what goes into it. Making a new chart, pretty simple. Click on new chart. We'll give a name for the chart, so let's just say this is going to be, let's do an aggregate course chart, number 3, we can add titles and subtitles to the chart which can appear on the chart.
Most cases, the chart itself doesn't contain any title and it just relies on context within the MSB document for that.
Then you get to select your chart type, so we went over briefly the different kinds. Let's do aggregate course chart.
The actual generation of the chart is what determines what shows up, but you'll see that it's very similar between the different charts of how this all works.
So step one here is we're going to pick the call them gradebook courses that the grades that we're going to be displaying in these charts are linked to.
So I'm just gonna say let's do anatomy, behavioral sciences, cardiovascular. I'm then able to also label the x-axis. So well we're gonna have courses on the x-axis so we'll just call it courses.
Then we have the setting for the y-axis. The version of the chart that you saw there did it in counts.
So we're counting the number of grade statuses for that particular course, for the cohort that we're generating against. And we'll just say, we'll just call that count.
We also have a bar chart size. And so what that means is we get to pick how big the chart is going to be.
And so you'll want to be aware of this as you're creating the document. And you'll probably want to do some test runs to see how it looks.
Cause you can't, add a large chart. There is also an ability to put a chart within a table, where the chart will attempt to auto-size.
But it's always good to set a value here as well. The default is 800. If you make it, larger, the chart will get bigger.
If you make it smaller, the chart will get smaller. And then lastly here, we can pick the different grade statuses that will appear in our chart.
So here let's say I don't actually want to include, any failures. I only want to show the difference between honors and pass.
So I can select those two. I then color code the grade status. So I'm saying whoever has a grade of honors will be, get red, and then pass will get a color of blue.
Let's just say something like that, and then you can select the order on the chart as well, and in an earlier video we had selected, or we had created different document categories that allows us to link the images generated by this tool to a document category, and then we use that to then place in the

Submitting a requirement on behalf of a user
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about how you as an administrator can submit a requirement on behalf of one of the users that you oversee.
So we'll go to Requirements to do this, and there's two places we can do this we're going to have a look at the Assignments page.
So we can also do this through the Status Board. But really, it's just two different views for the same action we're going to take.
It's more of like a personal preference thing. So we'll go to Assignment. This is like a table view for this, so all of your assignments will appear here.
You can then use these various different filters to find the one you're looking for. And in this case, we're just going to pick basically any of these sample requirements here because we're just submitting on behalf of a user.
Now generally speaking, we don't really recommend this if you are sending out a requirement for your users to fill in.
If you've done that, you don't want to do that for them, right? You kind of want to put that on them.
That'll save you a bunch of time. But if for whatever reason, it's easier that you do it for them or you have set up the requirement in such a way that you are going to do the upload, which is a setting that you can set on the requirement template itself, then go ahead and use this function.
And if you've seen the video in the article about how to do this from the user's perspective, that's actually received the requirement assignment, it'll be very similar for your end.
So we'll just look at Carmen's requirement here, click on view, and you can see there's no submission yet, so we're not seeing any information submitted by them, but I have the option here to click submit new requirement, which will effectively give me the same form that they would fill out in order
to submit the requirement, except I'm doing it on their behalf. So in this case, I'm just gonna submit some data here to allow this to work, save the submission, and also because it is I as the admin, creating this requirement is just gonna go ahead and be auto-approved.
I do not then need to go and approve it separately. And we could do the same thing as well from the status board page.
It's just gonna be a little bit different. Let's clean this. Just page up a little bit. So here, it's just a different way of looking at the same data.
So here I select the, the thing I'm looking for. So I'm just looking for sample requirements. And then I know I sent this to my incoming tradeee.
So here are the different people that the requirements. I was sent to. So if I click on incomplete here, same exact thing.
I can submit this on behalf of the user and it will also be auto-approved. So, same exact action, just different views to look at it as in some cases, this view where it's shown on a table, it helps to visualize how many are still remaining for whatever requirement you are looking at.

Simple view of block schedule
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about a special view that we've created that we're calling the SimpleView right now for block schedules.
So let's get right into it. If we go to schedules on our left math, we'll be taking a block schedule and you'll see there's a button.
Here for SimpleView. And so the thing that makes this unique, and you can kind of see it, maybe if you could read it on the tool tip there is that this page is publicly shareable.
It does not require a login or even an account in metrics. So if I click on it here I'll be taken to a separate URL.
And so this URL up here, this basically represents the URL for this page. Share this on your internet. You could post it somewhere.
It doesn't really matter how you get it around, but basically it allows people that need to know, but maybe don't have accounts and metrics or don't want to be bothered with logging into metrics to see this, that kind of thing.
You can just share this URL with them directly and whatever way you see fit, and they'll be able to see.
The rotation schedules for your program just, just like that. So they don't have to log in, they'll be taken directly to it and they could see this information.
So this is particularly helpful. A lot of times with other staff that may not be directly involved in the day to day metrics, but might need to be able to see the rotation schedule of your program.
So this is very handy for that. And that's really what makes unique. Otherwise it works a lot like the normal block schedules page.
It does come with a couple of other tools like you can show or hide the sites that appear on it.
You'll see that in red here, we have basically vacation time or sick time or other things like that. Showing up and there's also the option to show or hide shift schedules.
I don't have any shift schedules on this specific one, but those can also be shown or hidden here. And so basically this is very useful in cases where you need to share the schedule with a bunch of people, but maybe not all those people have.
Have accounts and metrics or they don't regularly log in. So you don't want to put that kind of gate up of needing to log in to view the schedule.
And so there are cases where maybe it's not appropriate to share rotation schedules like that. But if that's the case, you probably already know about that internally within your program, but in cases where it is okay we do recommend making use of this cause it just makes things easier.
People don't need to log into the system or even have accounts in the system to be able to see the information on your program's block schedules.
That's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Generating Charts
Hi there, in this video we're discussing generating charts. So in the previous video, probably we talked about creating these different charts and now that we have created them we can generate them for a group of users.
And when I say group of users, I actually mean just that. We can create groups in Metrix and that is the way the MSP generation works.
So we're going to end up creating or generating the MSP documents against a group of users. And we're going to generate the charts against that same group of users.
So to do that, we can pick one of our chart types here, let's say the competency quartile chart. I click generate.
I'll then search for my group of users. I've named it MSP cohort here. Click generate charts and email confirmation and then click yes.
So what happens here, this can take some time depending on the complexity of the charts, the number of users, and all that kind of stuff.
So that's why this happens in the background. So when this generates, When the generation is finished, you will receive an email from Metrix letting you know that it's finished, and you'll also get to see the last generated field and the generation log once it's complete, but until that point, you're
going to see in progress. So, after a few minutes, you'll get an email letting you know that the generation has completed, and then you can go about taking whatever actions you need to with that chart.

Block schedule creation
Hi there, in this video we're going to be going over how you create new block schedules. So I'm starting off here on the dashboard, which is likely where you're going to be, and we're going to go to schedules.
And so I'll be defaulted to the block schedules tab, so this is where we want to be anyway. You can see I already have one.
Block schedule that I've created here for this academic period, but we're going to go ahead and make another as an example.
So to make a new block schedule, you will click on new block schedule in the top right here. And we're just going to fill out this form.
There's a block schedule that I've created here for this academic period. So to make a new block some more details about some of these fields.
So watch out for those. But in general, you don't need to fill out everything here to make a block schedule.
So first things first, need to link this to an academic year, or some folks refer to this as an academic period.
So I'm going to link it to the current one that we were working in. Give the schedule a name. So this is not all that important in this case, but of course you want to name the block schedule something that is going to be recognized by any other people in your program viewing it just to be clear
. So that's why my previous one was called residence, a master schedule. You know, you could do something like master schedule.
If you have a. A lot of different types of trainees in your program, but either way, just name it something that'll be clear to everyone.
Next up we have description. So like it says, it's a description field. It's not required. Probably most box giddles don't actually have them.
Cause usually the name is enough, but if there's any other additional information you want to show. People that might be viewing the schedule is a good place to put it.
Going down here, specifying sites and administrators. This is all optional and not something most block schedule will have to worry about.
But briefly if you select the site, only rotations linked to the. At site will be schedulable on your block schedule.
And then down here under schedule administrators, this is good for granting admin rights over this specific block schedule to any given user.
So this is often used for say, like chief residents that need access just to edit the block schedule, but not necessarily all the other parts.
Of being a program administrator in metrics. So keep that in mind. Then we will need to select at least one of these things.
So this is basically who gets to be on this schedule. And in most cases, this comes down to roles. So very easy way to make a block schedule quickly is to include include all of your trainee roles under the block schedule.
So that's what I'm going to do here. I'm going to select B2I 1, 2, and 3. So all users in my program that are active and match this role will appear on the schedule and you can give them schedules.
And same concept applies to these other options. We have user groups. My program currently doesn't have have any because I don't need any.
But if you want a segment who shows up on your schedule by a very specific group that you've created, you can do that here.
And in that case, you could disable the roles field. You don't need them both. You just need one of these things to be filled.
And then the last thing you can do is very specific is just putting certain individuals on. On the block schedule.
So if there's a very limited set of people that you want to add, or let's say I'm adding all my residents here, each one, one, two, and three, but there's a couple of specific attendings that I want to throw on here, something like that.
This is a good option for that. So to move on with creating the block schedule, you need to fill. Either user roles, user groups, or individuals, but you only need to fill one of them.
So you don't need to have a selection of something in each of them. View only access. So this is good to give people the ability to see the schedule on their own personal portal.
So if that's helpful. Helpful for your program, all you need to do is select the roles that this can apply to.
So if all of the other if all the residents should be able to see all the other residents schedules, this is a quick way to do that and just give view only access to those people.
You can of course also just do a quick control. You can see it. And of course, if you want to do something more specific than that you get select individuals.
So individuals can be granted view rights as well. At the bottom here, scheduling templates. So you can also choose to create the blocks on your block schedule while you are making it.

User handling a rejected requirement
Hi there, in this video we're talking about how your users can deal with a rejected requirement. So the good news is that's not going to be a whole lot different than submitting the requirement in the first place.
So just like submitting the requirement, they'll go to requirements on the left nav and they'll see here. But instead of seeing something like incomplete or pending review, this will have a status of rejected.
If they view that submission, they can see their original submission. They can then see who reviewed it, the date of that review, as well as any comments that may have been provided during that review, and then they can simply submit a new submission under this same requirement assignment.
And that's that. If we do so right here, we'll just add some data to have this go through and save.
And that's it. And that will send that new submission to an administrator for review.

Block creation on block schedule
Hi there, in this video we're going to be talking about how to create blocks on your block schedule. So this is something that you might have already done automatically is the case with the creation of a lot of block schedules.
So we'll go from our dashboard to the schedules tab on the left. And you can see I've already created a couple of block schedules here and you can see how many blocks are attached to each.
So let's talk about creating the blocks. So if we go to create a new block schedule, you will see that one of the options here is to auto generate the blocks.
The blocks. And if I turn this on, it will basically use the start date of the academic year that the block schedule was tied to as the start date.
And then I get to basically pick a repeating pattern. So some of the common ones that we see across our clients are for.
Four week blocks, calendar month blocks. There's some clients that like a four plus two, meaning a four week block followed by a two week block.
And you can use these different templates to create your block skidters automatically. And this works for a good portion of the block schedules that'll be applied to metrics.
But in cases where this doesn't work, you also have the ability to create your own manually or tweak them. So just for the sake of being clear on all the options here, a couple of other options that exist under this section are do not create blocks less than a week.
So depending on when your academic year or academic period starts, you might get into a weird situation. Situation where it would create less than one week worth of block at some point.
So you could turn this on and it'll just kind of tack that on to the last block of the schedule.
And another option here is to pick a custom start day. So as mentioned, it will use the start. Update of the academic year that the block is linked to by default.
But if for some reason, that is not when you want to start your block schedule, you do have the ability to pick a custom day.
So take a look at our create block schedule video for more details on that. But in most cases, you're probably best off.
Off either using one of the default templates or using that template and then making some quick modifications. So if we go back to block schedules, you'll see that for each of the block schedules already have here, I have this button for managed blocks.
And so if I click on that, I'll be taken to the. Blocks that exist on that current block schedule. So you can see these are all for the academic year, July 1st, 2022 to June 30, 2023.
And I have just done a basically a monthly block schedule here. So July, August, September and so on, nothing too crazy here.
But if you want. You want to make edits to this, it's very easy to just click in here, pick a new date, check mark, and that's it.
So this is why I suggest in many cases, instead of trying to make these all from scratch, you can most likely just use some of the templates and slightly adjust the dates.
A couple of things. Could be aware of though is block schedules is not over not allowed to overlap. So if I were to try to do something like that, I'm going to get an error message that tells me, Hey, I, I can't do that.
So keep that in mind when you're attempting to make changes these blocks schedules is you cannot have the blocks overlap, which makes a.
Good thing of sense but I'm just going to go ahead and delete a couple of these blocks schedules. So you'll notice if you start using metrics and attempt to delete block schedules, you may not be able to delete some of them.
And that is because they have been used. So on that schedule, if you can't delete a block, that means that there's a rotation schedule.
You will tie it to that block. So if you do want to keep deleting that block, you'll want to delete the rotation schedule first.
But I've just deleted a few here just to get those and show you how we can add blocks manually. So if you want to, you can use this little template here, this pop up, give the block a name, give it a start date.
So we're gonna go back in time here to the start of July June. Here we go. So it's, July 1st and then we can move that to go back the ways end of July.
So basically just remaking the same one, add that, click add block, and then basically you can continue this. You can keep going.
It'll also add one day to the last end date to keep things like. End up so you can use this to pretty quickly add your block schedules if you need to.
But in most cases you're probably better off just using the block schedule generation that we went over, but if you do need to add the manually, you can use this function to do so.
Click save and you can see there is my new block. That's the end of this video. Thanks for watching.

Creating Rotations
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about creating rotations in metrics. And so creating rotations is a big part of using a lot of the functions in metrics for your rotation schedules, of course, for when and where people are going.
That's going to be tied to evaluations. You're going to do a bunch of reporting based on this. So rotations and discussion.
The variables that are created from them, ah, are kind of like a backbone of a lot of the stuff you do in metrics.
So let's get into it. So if you look on the left side under system setup, we have this section for rotations.
And so this will show you basically a list of all the different rotations that you already have in the system.
Right? And so you could use this to search. Of course, you have to type it correctly. Ah, but yes, you can find quickly clinic, gastro, et cetera.
You can see the different rotations that already exist. Ah, you can also quickly download and export of these if you want to just put them in excel for, one reason or another.
But specifically we're talking about creating new rotations here. And so to do that, we quickly just click add rotation. This will take me to a page where I get to fill out a couple of things.
So I need to name my rotation. So let's use the example given here. So cardiology, rotation, let's call that. I need to give it a.
Codename, which it's just a, an abbreviation that'll help people identify it. And without having to write out the whole thing all the time.
And this will also be used in some reports as well as some imports that we can do in the system.
So I'll just call it card like that. And then very important here, it's like doing the site. So for a rotation to be created in metrics.
Must be linked to a site. And so this is basically the location it takes place, right? So search here. I'm going to say this takes place at metrics hospital north.
And then we have this rotation type selection here. This is not really required. But it might be helpful for you to select different rotation types.
So if you do have different types of rotations that we've created for you in metrics and that's helpful for you and filtering the data in some way, those will appear here.
You can show a description. So if you need to put a description for the rotation, you can add it here and people can see that as they.
You can also view the rotation settings here, allowing trainees to swap their rotation assignment. So there's another video all about that, but specifically, if that's people say, Hey, I want to swap this rotation with this other person's rotation.
Please prove it. You can also excuse people scheduled to this rotation. From conferences and other events. So basically saying, Hey, if you're on this rotation and we have some kind of didactic or lecture at the same time, you're going to be automatically excused because we don't expect you to come.
And so that helps with attendance reporting. We also have this setting here for reminding individuals to log their cases on a number of days.
Before the end of the rotation. And that can be helpful to remind people to do certain things if they're not quite getting it done.
And then lastly here, we have rotation directors and administrators. And so you can select an individual here and give them special rights over the rotation.
If you need to. And so doing all those things, click save and voila, we have created our rotation. And if you need to go back and edit it, simply find it.
It just so happens to be the first thing here. But let's use our search. Cardiology rotation, click edit. And we can go in and make changes to the rotation.
That's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Medtrics - 23 February 2024
Hi there, in this video we're going over how to add custom fields and charts to the MSPE template. So, to do so, we'll go to Documents and Templates.
When you create a chart or a custom field, you'll have a in Metrics that will automatically create the Merge field that you're going to use to then later add that chart or custom field information to the document.
So, we'll go to MSPE 2025 here. This is very blank at this point anyway. And what we're going to do is we're going to add some of these chart types.
So, just to find them quickly, I'm going to look for image. So, we can see these are the two different types of charts that we already have in system here.
And I'm just going to select those. And some of the other, oh well they happen to be right here, some of the other custom fields that we've created, noteworthy characteristics, right?
So, by adding those merge fields here on this merge field page, that allows me to then use them in this new uhm new content page.
So you can see here, here are the different ones. And just like we added these in our earlier example, I can just select and add merge field and it will add the appropriate merge field for me there.
And then this applies to the charts too. So if I want to add the second year aggregate chorus bar. Chart here, I can click that and that will also work.
And it all uses the same formatting as our typical merge fields as well like you see here with first name and last name.
And so that's all there is to it. Of course you probably don't want to format it like this. This is just a quick example of how to do this and we'll have some other examples later on for editing the content within the MSP document when there's a lot more to work with in here.

Reviewing requirements on status board
Hi there. In this video we're going to be reviewing how you can review requirement assignments through the status board page.
So if we go to requirements on the left nav, and then go to status board. You'll see that I've already come in here and selected some of the requirements, so ACL certification and the sample requirement.
And what's neat about this page is that those selections will persist over time. So if there's a certain set of requirements that I know I'm going to be looking at for the next couple of weeks, I can just kind of set those up and then they'll just be here when I look at it.
And in this case, I'm going I know that I've assigned this to either incoming residents or incoming trainees. So I could see that under ACL certification, I have two requirements that have been submitted and are still pending reviews.
So let's open up one of these. Let's open up Kevin's. I can click on pending review here. At the top, I'll see any information about the requirement itself.
So if I need to refresh my own memory about what exactly this is and what I'm looking for, I might find that information up here.
And then down here is the details. So I could look here, see when it was submitted, when the deadline is 4, if they submitted any attachments along with the requirement, I could check that file out, so I could click the file.
In case I can see, it's just a blank ACGLASS card, so that's not going to help us very much, right?
So I can come in here, and I can choose to just replace the file with a correct one, if perhaps it was provided to me through some other reason.
That means I can see the expiration renewal date here, as well as any notes or comments left by the submitter, as well as any ID that might be attached to this requirement.
So at this point, I'm going to say that I'm going to reject this one, because it's just a, it's a blank, right?
So they provided a card, but it provides no details. So I'm going to say, card is blank, please resubmit. And so now I can reject that submission.
This is now then sent to the user and they can be notified that this was a rejected requirement and they need to go do something and they can handle on their end.
It'll come back to you as pending review once they have done that. On the other hand, if we look at this one, and let's just pretend this is all good, I'll say approve submission and then that's all I have to do.
Any documents that are attached. To that submission have now been created under the document tab on their user profile and I can view them there in perpetuity.

Reviewing requirements on assignments page
The Assignments page. So to access this, we'll go to Requirements on the left map and then Assignments. So this is basically just going to be a list or a table of the different requirements that that have been assigned under your program over time.
And at the very top, this works a lot like other filters in the system. Very similar to, say, the Evaluation Assignments page.
We can pick the specific requirement. We can select what roles they've applied to specific users. If we wish, we could look at statuses.
We could look at documents. And then we have some date filtering, both for when it's assigned, when the deadline is for, when it was submitted, or when it was approved or rejected.
So using all of these different filters, you can easily find the different requirements that you need. And so in this case, we're trying to review, uhh, pending requirements submissions.
That's basically what it comes down to, so the easiest way to do that is from the status filter, to select pending review, then hit the filter requirements button, and you will see that we only have the one requirement to review.
And from here, I just click on view. We can see in this case, there's a bit of a history to this one, so there was an earlier submission, which we as the admin rejected.
We can see that here. And then this is the new submission. Under the same requirement. And, you know, we're going to pretend that this number is better than this number, and this number is correct.
Okay? And so if we say that this is now a good requirement submission, we could put a note if we want, but that's pretty unnecessary if we're just going to approve it.
And we can go ahead and approve the submission. And that is that. That is how you approve requirements on the assignments page.

Adding Rotation Curriculum 📚
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss adding rotation curriculum. So curriculum in this case basically refers to a file.
So in most cases it's a Word document or preferably it's a PDF document and it just represents the goals and objectives or whatever it represents for you for that particular rotation.
So to add this to a rotation we can go to system setup, rotations. We'll select the rotation here. And you can see there's a button here for choosing a file to add to this particular rotation.
So this is going to be the official rota- rotation curriculum document. And effectively what this does is when I add a file here, is it adds it under the rotation resource folder.
So under resources, rotation resources, you'll see that a folder is is automatically created for all of rotation. So when you create a rotation, a rotation resources folder is created along with it.
And I can select my rotation and that curriculum document will appear here. And so that document can be sent out.
Automatically via a rule that's placed in metrics. So make sure to turn that on. If you are looking to deliver this curriculum automatically.
But if you are not, you can leave it here. And it's also going to be accessible at any time to whoever has permissions.
And by default, all users in your program. Have permissions to the rotation resources folders. So feel free to add via that rotation curriculum.
That one just really the curriculum file here just kind of designates. This is the very specific document that we consider to be our curriculum.
But that does not mean that you cannot add more files under a rotation resources folder. Right? So here you can upload any file you wish.
It could be hyperlinks and these can be sent out. To your residents or trainees automatically based on when they are starting their rotations.
That's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Creating MSPE Cohort Group
Hi there, in this video we'll be discussing creating the MSP Cohort Group. So, there's nothing particularly special about the MSP Cohort Group.
It's just a group like any other group in the system that you might need. For scheduling purposes or evaluation purposes, but it's it's the way that the system knows who to generate the document for.
So, we need to make a group to represent, hey here's the group of users that we're going to create these charts for.
And eventually, the MSPE form. So, to do that, we're going to go to users, we'll go to groups, and for this current academic year, we've got a bunch of different groups already, but we'll go ahead and make some more.
There's a couple of different ways to make groups probably at some point prior to actually doing this in Metrix, you want to come up with the list of people that will actually need the MSPE generated for them.
It's probably, probably going to be a fluctuating list, you could probably start with here's all the students that are in their final year, some of them won't quite make it to the end, might have extensions, might drop from the program, etc.
Others might come back from previous years. Others that need another MSPE generated, so the list is not going to be something that you can get outright out of metrics, but here are a couple of tools that you probably want to use.
So, we can create a new group here, let's just call it MSPE cohort 2025, we can link it to a particular academic period, whatever is appropriate, and you will not likely need any of these sites or group tags options here.
So, we can just make that, okay? So here's our group. For the sake of showing you how to do this, you can add group members and well, remove them as well.
I would only recommend that when it's time to kind of clean up the list. So, you probably want to generate the whole list from some other mechanism from some other database, some other way.
But, once you actually have users in the list, then go ahead and modify them here. So, you can click on add members here, we can add users like so, and we can remove them like so, and that's really all it takes to do that, just add or remove.
That's how to do it manually though that's gonna be slow, especially if you're a larger school and you got a couple hundred students that you might need MSPEs for.
So, the better way to do it instead is by using this upload function. So, you can upload groups, download this Excel template, and this can be pretty simple because likely wherever you're gonna get this from, you'll have the student's names and emails, and then we could just paste that right in.
So, you can see here we have the group name, call that, I mean I guess what we just called the existing group.
Note that this will also update existing groups. It will not only create, so if it sees that a group already exists, it'll just reuse that one.
Then we have the academic year, so you can add your academic year there. Pay attention to the format. So, I'm just going to copy that from there, just for the sake of having something, so that's going to be the format you want to use.
Then we have the group member, so this is just going to be the email address of the user in question, and then group tag, sites, and group role.
You don't need anything there, so basically you can repeat, let's just do like 30 or so, you can repeat this for each of the members of the group, so whenever you get your long list of emails of whoever's going to get the MSPE generated for them, just go ahead and do that, you know, let's pretend those
are all different emails, and then you can use this as an upload file, the one thing you want to remember is just clear out this first row, these are instructions, right, of what to do with each field.
So just delete that before upload, and then now you have an easy way to generate a group with a lot of people in it.

Medtrics - 15 December 2023
Hi there, in this video we're going to go over how automatic requirement renewal works. So this is basically a very easy way to automate the process of people being reminded that they have some kind of expiring document, license, or expiration, and then redoing the entire process for requiring requirement
, assignment, submission, and approval, basically automatically. So we'll go to requirements here, we'll go to templates, and this is the first place we're going to look.
So you can see here this ACLS certification is tagged as auto-renew. So that means that on the template towards the bottom, there's a section for auto-renewal, and it says metrics will use the expiration date as the deadline when it auto-generates requirements.
So what that means is any of the submissions against this form for which we have required down here that they submit an expiration date along.
With it, 90 days before that particular document expires, it will send out a new requirement assignment to that person that, uhm, has the expiring document, and then they'll just basically repeat this process, you'll be able to approve it, and then once it's approved, it will just automatically archive
the older version of the document and display the new one. So that's the first part of it is down here, this expiration date being turned on and given a value here as well as the auto-renewal.
So if that is turned on, what happens, and we've gone over this in other videos, here, so, for example, here's something for Matt Barry.
He has an approved submission from earlier, right? And it has an expiration date of December 15th, so you can see the system has already gone and made another one.
If we look at his document, Matt Barry here, view profile, documents and certification, here is that document. So, because I just made that rule, and we're within the 90 days, this is only 16 days away, the system has automatically made a new requirement for Matt to submit for his ACOS certification.
And when he does so, this document here will be made archived so it'll just archive it, you can still look at older ones here, under the archive tab if you need to, but it will be archived and the new submission will appear here once you go through the approval process again.

Creating grades through evaluations
Hi there, in this video we'll be talking about creating grades through the evaluations. So this is a pretty typical use case, uhm, creating the grades through the interface like this may not be that typical.
Many schools choose to do this via integrations with whatever their system of record is for grades. But, it is also possible to enter them in Metrics directly in this way, and also potentially edit things if necessary.
Perhaps that integration didn't work as expected. So to do this, we'll go to Evaluations, Assignments, I'm going to search for my user that I've been using here, and it's also important to select the form where the grade's going to be posted, so this is typically some kind of like final evaluation that
is done, typically against clerkships. So if we go, we select the clerkship student evaluation for this user, we'll clear the start date to see some of these old ones, and you can see here that along with the status of the evaluation, we also have statuses for whether they have revised comments, and
also whether they actually already have final grades. So if we look at this one on the bottom, neither thing is true.
Right? So we could go down here, go to view most recent response, and then once this loads and we scroll down a little bit, we'll go to a section here where we're allowed to add a grade.
So, a couple of things are going to happen here. The system is going to try to auto detect a few things.
So it's going to try to identify the number of weeks. This might be important, something that you might display on your MS Word.
So it's going to look for the number of weeks, it's going to identify the date, which is the date that the basically the grade happens by default, it's looking for that end date of the schedule, and then it will attempt to identify the graded course rotation that is related to this rotation, so we can
see it's pediatrics core, but this particular rotation must not be linked to the actual ah graded course rotation, which is why it didn't pick up on this automatically.
So from here, I can then search, what am I doing, preceptor, no, pediatrics, core, I think maybe it's just pediatrics, yeah, here we go, so pediatrics, that's our graded course rotation, and then I have a couple of different fields I can choose to fill out.
Score is actually a numeric score, so if you want to enter in some kind of numeric value here to represent the grade, you can do that, but you'll see that none of these fields are actually required necessarily.
Then we have primary status, so this is typically where the grade actually is, so in this case honor pass fail, you might have other types of statuses that you could be adding, but let's say they did quite well, they'll get a primary status.
Then we have secondary statuses, there may not be a use case for this at your particular institution, but what this is often used for is things like competency score, so perhaps they had a primary status of honor, right, that's the actual grade that goes into your grading system, but as an additional
point of information, you might include something like, oh they actually also did quite well with their competencies, right, for this particular thing.
So if they got honors, perhaps they had something for it exceeds expectation, and both of these things can show up on the MSPE.
So some schools do choose to have multiple values that they could pull from the grade. And then lastly here is the type.
In many cases, there will only be one selection here, so final grade. Lastly, there is a description field that we can include here.
Again, as noted in the field itself, this is just some text that we can also display in the MSPE if we need to.
If there is a need to have some kind of additional information, you can add that to this field here and that could be shown on the MSPE.
So with everything complete, this is our grade. We can go to the bottom and hit the save grade button and that is how you add a grade directly through an evaluation.

Documents automatically created via requirement approval
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk a little bit about one of the neat functions that we have under requirements, which is that any kind of file or documentation that is attached to a requirement, upon approval of that submission, it will automatically be added under the user's documents on their
profile. So we're just going to do a quick demonstration of that here. So. On the requirements and assignments page, I'm going to look at Matt Berry's document here.
It's currently a status of incomplete. I'm just going to complete this from the administration portal, but this would work the same way if it was submitted by the user and then I approved it.
So this is not unique to just me completing it as an asset. Admin. So if I click on view here, submit new requirement, I'm going to upload a document.
So I just have a generic kind of picture in this case, but this could be whatever field it needs to be or whatever file it needs.
And I'll just set a date here and save the submission and this is now approved. And so what that means is, if I go look at Matt Barry's account, Matt Barry, open it up, go to view profile, and then I view his documents and certifications, it will now appear here and I can view it, I can edit it, I can
delete it, I can do whatever I need to. But basically this is the primary reason for the requirements feature. So that you can collect this information easily and it will just kind of show up on their profile and you know it will always be there and yeah, just a really easy way to organize all your documentation
and collect it from your various users.

Understanding Rotation Resource Folders 📁
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about rotation resource folders. So resources is a module and metrics that allows you to share files and specifically rotation resources are folders that are automatically created each time you make a rotation to be able to just have a place to put files and
information that you can share. You may need to share with people that are going to that rotation and one that you use to use Place.
So just a concept to look at if we look at system setup and then rotations, these are the rotations that we have on our program in this demo system.
And if we then go to, resources, and then look at rotation resources here, or scroll down and find rotation resources here.
Each rotation will automatically have a folder created for it. And then if you click into each one of them, you can then upload five.
Or hyperlinks or whatever it is you need to put here to each rotation resource folder and that will then interact with our automatic tool for notifying people about here's the information you need to know about going to this rotation and so whatever files that you put in a rotation resource folder will
be available to Anyone that is scheduled to rotation or really anyone that is part of your program There's not really any restrictions on being able to see this stuff But if someone is scheduled to go to that rotation They may receive an email from metrics that contains a link to each of the documents
or whatever you might have in here A few days prior to starting the rotation and that is going to be in this section here under system setup settings.
If we look at this and then go to curriculum you will see there is an option here for send curriculum to Chinese.
Via email, x days before the start of the rotation. So curriculum in this case refers to all the content that is within a rotation resource folder.
So we would turn that on, and the default value here is seven days. So seven days before the rotation starts, an email will be sent containing.
Links to all of those rotational resources that you have uploaded.

mass approving requirements
Hi there. In this video we're talking about how to manage your requirement assignments in both. So to do this you're gonna go to requirements on the left map and you'll go to assignments here.
And so this page allows you to very much like the evaluation assignments comments page and other pages. And metrics take bulk actions against your requirements here.
So for example, if I wanted to just delete or approve or reject a number of requirements at once, I can do that using these checkboxes.
So when I do that, you can see that I have an action button here where I can either delete, approve, or reject the different requirements in bulk right from here.
And so using this tool, you can do exactly what you need to, so usually that would be something like coming to requirements, picking a specific requirement, selecting a status like overdue or something like that, and maybe you delete those in bulk because you've done something else to take care of that
. In your program, so using this tool, you can quickly take bulk actions against your various requirement assignments.

What can calendar administrators do and how?
Hi there. In this video, we're going over what calendar administrators can do from their personal portal. So in a previous video, we went over how to give someone calendar admin permissions, and here we can actually see what that means.
So I'm logged in as one of my trainees here who I've given calendar access to. So when I had never done this before, and I navigate to my calendar on the left nav, I basically have the same tools when it comes to creating editing events as well as logging attendance as a normal program admin would,
but I don't have all the other things program admins do. So within the calendar, I'm exactly the same as a program administrator, but outside of that, I have no other permissions if I'm only granted a key.
So like I said, just like with the program admin portal, creating events, editing events is all the same. They have all the same tools.
They can do all the same things. So there's no limitations. And the same can be said for log attendance. So they have all the same tools, filters, and everything works exactly the same as if you were a normal program administrator doing the work of a calendar administrator.

Revising Comments through evaluations
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about revising comments through evaluations. So revising comments is usually a pretty important part of the MSP process.
This is for when your students are going through clerkships. And at the end of that clerkship, they're likely evaluated by some preceptor.
Now, many schools like to add those preceptor comments to their MSPE next to the grade that the student received for that course.
But not always is that, That comment just 100% directly translatable, and you can put it on MSPE. Perhaps it has issues with grammar, punctuation, it just doesn't look quite as professional.
So, we have a mechanism in place with metrics where we could take that original comment, preserve it just the way it is, that's good for data integrity reasons, but also revise it and then display that revised comment on the MSPE for the student's grade.
So, to do that we're gonna go to evaluation. We're gonna go find our little test user here, clerkship student eval, those are the final evals in question, and then it looks like we got six of them, so you'll see a number of these already have.
Revised comments, and this one at the bottom does not, so let's go ahead and do that. So I'll open it up, go to view most recent response, it'll open up here, and typically you'll find these comments towards the end, of course this is all customizable, per institution, per form, so.
It might change, but you can see here at the bottom, we have comments, which will be included in the student's MSPE, and then just additional comments, so if we scroll down to the bottom here, this is the comments section, here we can select the original comment, which will just kind of display that
here, this is for your information, and then in this case, you can see, well, we have no comments, so that doesn't do us a lot of good so we could say something nice about the student here Debra.
Is a great student and will make a great doctor, right, something easy like that, hey, let's add an exclamation mark, why not and so once I do this and hit save comment, that is now my revised comment, so instead of displaying, no comment on the MSPE, it'll find the same grade through the evaluation
and then display this instead on the MSPE document.

Enabling Automatic Notifications for Rotation Curriculum 📩
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about how you can enable automatic notifications about upcoming rotation curriculum for anyone that is scheduled to that rotation.
So in another video we spoke more in depth about rotation resources, which is a default about upcoming rotation curriculum for anyone that is scheduled to that rotation.
So in this video we're going to talk about how you can enable automatic notifications folder that is created which contains a specific folder for each of your rotations in which you can put whatever file, hyperlinks, whatever information you may need to share with someone that is going to be doing this
rotation. And so when you put all this information into this rotation resource holder, you have the ability to send out an automatic notification a few days before the user might go to the rotation to send all that information to them via email and you can do so by going to system setup settings and
that is this setting here. So you can see it says send curriculum to Chinese via email X days before the start of the rotation and you can set your own value there.
It is defaulted to seven days so by default if you turn this setting on anyone entering a rotation that has a rotation resource folder that has some content underneath it, we'll get an email from metrics seven days before they actually start that rotation with links to all the content in that rotation
resource folder.

Setting up Automatic Reminders for Trainees to Log Cases 📅
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about setting up an automatic reminder for your trainees to log cases as they near the end of their rotation.
So using the rotation schedules that you've previously entered into metrics, the system can identify when a trainee is about to end that rotation and send a reminder about, hey, you should be able to your trainees to log cases as they near the end of their rotation.
So using the rotation to do your case logs if you haven't yet. And so to turn that on, you would go to System Setup, Settings, Cases, and then this is going to be this first entry here.
So you can see it's currently turned on on my demo program, and it says for. Remind scheduled individuals to log cases x days relative to the end date of the rotation.
So you can put a number in there and basically x days prior to the end of the rotation the system will send an email notification to remind that specific person that your rotation is ending soon and to please log your case.
If you have not done so. So this is just a good way to let people know that it's coming to an end.
And with some of the settings that you can apply to your case logs, if you are applying them for your program, it can actually hide the specific templates if they are not on a specific rotation.
So if you are using some of the more advanced functions and when to display a case log. Template. You probably want to turn this setting on to make sure people are reminded that you don't have infinite time to log these cases so you probably want to get to it.

Attendance reporting
Hi there. In this video, we're going over attendance reporting from your calendar. So there's two ways to get to these reports.
One is to click on reports from your left hand, go to events here, and then you can choose by people or by event.
So basically with what this means is how often a person goes to conferences and then the attendance from specific different events, right?
So if I click on either of these, the eagle-eyed amongst you, we'll see that it just basically took us to the calendar page.
So the other way to do this is to go to the Yeah, okay. And then you will see the attendance by people and attendance by events reports.
And from here, this report by people, like I said, is basically looking at individuals and seeing how often they come to events.
So for all individuals that participated in it. Events from the start date to the end date. Let's see how they're doing.
I don't see many of these folks often don't go to the calendar events that they are invited to. Right? So let's look at a happier number here.
Let's switch to September and September. Wow. Everyone came to everything. How great. Right? So that is the view here. Of course, you could search by various criteria, people, event types, roles, attendance, status, all the different things as usual within metrics.
Note here that you can print this report, save it as a PDF, and also download it as an Excel. And then for the attendance by events report, it basically is the same tool, right?
Same kind of filtering options, except we're not specifically looking at it. From the perspective of individuals, we're looking at it from the perspective of the event.
So we can see for morning conference, here are the people that are invited, here is who is attended, and here are the various percentages around that.
And again, you have the Excel, PDF, and Excel. You can print options just as you did with the previous page.

What is the resources module?
Hi there. In this video, we're going over the resources module and some of its potential usage. So, in the most basic sense, the resources module metrics is a way to share files among members of your program or institution.
So I'm currently on the program portal. I can go to resources on my left nav under internal medicine. And so when I go to this resources tab, this will show me all the different resource folders that I've created that are unique to my program or have been shared with my program.
So resources and metrics is fairly similar to other platform. Sometimes you may use you might have used Google Drive Microsoft's OneDrive, Microsoft's Shared Drive.
And the big advantage of using metrics is it is very likely that people in your program, notably your trainees, metrics is one of the major places that they go to do things, right?
In a lot of cases, create evaluations, do evaluations, check their calendars, so they're more likely to be in metrics than they are some of the other platforms which they may not go to often.
The other thing that you can do in metrics is limit things to your program. So those Shared Drives and Google Drives and One Drives and all that, those may be institutional drives, and it might contain a lot of information that is not particularly useful.
To your trainees, and you don't have a good way of filtering that because you as a coordinator for your program may not have the appropriate permissions to actually achieve those kinds of filterings for your students and trainees and faculty and so on.
But using roles and metrics and the other things that we set up under the resources module you can more easily cater to what your users actually need when they go to get files.
Things like policies, handbooks curriculum for the different rotations they might go to. They can all be in one place so, and it's likely the place that they're going to be anyway doing various other things.
So using the resources module in metrics for sharing files with your users can often be advantageous when compared to using a more generic tool like a Google Drive or OneDrive or something along those lines.

Using the Comment and Grade Status filters
Hi there. In this video we'll be discussing how to use a couple of different filters on the evaluations page to quickly identify which evaluations still need to be graded or which evals still need to have a revised comment added.
To them. So let's do that. So we'll go to evaluations and assignments here. We're gonna search for our test user here, Debra.
We're gonna pick the evaluation in question, clear the date, and we're gonna see these six assignments. So I've applied no filtering here at this point.
These are just the six evaluations that are tied to this user from this form. And we can see there in various states of completeness, right?
So this is what we would consider a complete. It's been submitted by the preceptor. We then took that, we graded it, and then we added a revised comment.
So that's what all these tags mean. So this one's basically done. It's going to show up on that SPE the way we want.
But maybe I just want to find a couple of different things. So let's say I see that these have revised comments, but they have no grades.
So I can look and say, does not have final grade, and it'll return those. So you can see here, here's one that has no comment or grade.
These two have. And I can do the opposite as well. I could say, hey, which ones do not have comments?
This is the only one that actually doesn't have a comment, right? And I can also mix these together. If I needed to, so I could say, hey, has final grade, does not have revised comment, and there's no cases where it actually has the grade, but not a comment.
So that's good. That's what we want. And you can see the opposite. I could also verify the good version of this where it has final grade and has revised comment.
Here they are. So these filters can be extremely handy when performing actions like creating grades and revising comments through the evaluations page.

Hi there. In this video, we're going over what the resource is in metrics. So in a earlier video, we talked about the resources module in general and some of the advantages it might have over other file sharing platforms that you might be using.
But specifically, just Just to note, a resource in metrics actually refers to the document or file or link or whatever it might be that you are sharing with other people.
So we have these resource folders here, but technically you actually do not need to put resources in resource folders. It is also possible to create a resource without putting it in a folder.
Though in some cases we usually recommend a bit of organization is helpful when putting things together for someone else to look at, but if there are some documents or links or something that does not quite fit into your resource folder structure, you can just create that by going to upload file and
then selecting who gets to see it. So you get to select users that match certain roles. Or users that are in certain groups and you can add files here and that will create the resource without putting it into a folder.
So just wanted to note that when we discuss the resource module, when we say resource that actually refers to the document or file or hyperlink itself and not necessarily these folders.
The folders are just places that hold resources.

Syncing administrative calendar
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how to sync your administrative calendar to your calendar of choice. So I am on the admin portal here for the internal medicine program.
We will go to calendar on our left nav. And so here we have the sync with my calendar option. So we also have this on the personal portal and that is for any events that you as an individual user are invited to.
So that is what most folks in metrics will probably make use of. But if we attempt to sync the calendar from the admin portal, this is actually pulling in all calendar events, right?
Because it is not specifically about who is invited. It is about does this calendar event exist under this program? So this can be useful for a variety of cases.
But either way the mechanism is very much the same name as with the personal calendar. So you click on sync with my calendar.
You have the different calendar options. If you click on any of these buttons, you can see the link here. This will take you to the instructions on how to are using a different calendar than any of those.
Most likely it supports this same process. This is a standard function among pretty much all calendars available. So you can use this and basically what you need to do is you need to copy this link and your calendar application is going to tell you to put it somewhere.
And once you do that calendar will sync to this file. That is represented here by this link and your calendar will also continuously sync to that.
One note however is that we here at Metrix cannot control how often that happens. So many calendars often update several times a day.
Some even as often as every 10-15 minutes or so. However, that will depend entirely on the calendar application that you are using.
And whether it has defaults that you can change or customize, that is up to the calendar application.

In this video I will demonstrate how you can edit the templates for your MSPE generation within Metrix. As a reminder, you always want to make sure you are logged in under the institutional portal in the top right hand corner of the screen.
And at this point in the process we would have all already created our merge fields and got the template started.
So from here we select documents, templates and you will see this screen and you can select one of your templates here and I will select this top one.
From here, Here you can name the template, select the programs that it's going to apply to. From here you want to select the role of the people this document is going to be generated for.
So in this case it would be MS4. You select the document category which would be MSPE and then edit permissions.
We have it selected as yes. Allow for full editing of the document. This will allow other administrators who are not on the institutional level.
To edit parts of the document where necessary. And we can hit save and continue. And now we go into the manage merge fields.
So you can see this is all of the merge fields that we have created to be used in documents like this.
from the right hand side you simply select the ones that you want to apply to this template. So you can scroll all the way down and see all of the different merge fields that have been created.
And then the ones that have been selected to be used on this particular template. it. And then the final screen you can see that we have a very similar to Microsoft Word text editor.
This is where you can go in you can add images like this to be embedded in the finalized document. And you can see where these The image fields are being entered.
Now when you're going through if you see anything that is not quite right or needs to be rearranged this works just like Microsoft Word.
So you can bold things, you can move formatting. Around and then anywhere you see this kind of text that is where the information will be inserted by the generator.
You can see all this and if you see something missing or at last minute decide something needs to be inserted here.
You can always at the top insert any of the merge fields into the text block where you have selected. So right below here we want to insert their first name.
At merge field you can see where that's been added right there. So it will pull from the system that information upon generating the document but obviously we don't actually want that there so I can just hit the undo button right there.
And you can also insert So this is information already created in the system. And then it creates a block of information that is dependent on the grade book rotation.
So you can pull course rotation. We, uhh score status, things like that to display that information similarly to what we have here in this section of the grade book.
Or of the template. And that is how you can edit. MSP templates within the system.

Setting up Rotation Administrators for your Rotations 👨‍💼
Hi there, in this video we're going to go over how to set up rotation administrators for your rotations. Now a quick preamble about what that actually means, a rotation administrator is someone that can either manage the rotation resources folder for the rotation, or will receive a special view.
To be able to see evaluations that were completed on trainees that were in their rotation. So to set this up we would go to system setup, rotations.
From here we select a rotation, click on the edit button. And then we have this section here for rotation directors and administrators.
And so what you could do here is select a user. So we're just going to pick Perry Cox here. And then you can apply one of those two permissions I mentioned.
So if Perry Cox should have the. To edit any of the content in a rotation resource folder. You can turn that on here.
And then the other ability, which is to view evaluations for individuals scheduled to this rotation, turn that on here. So a user does not need to have both.
They can have one or the other or both. And then if most of the content is scheduled, people need to have this permission.
You can also add more people to this. So let's say Perry Cox needs it, and also Lisa Cuddy needs the same rotation permissions.
You could do that here, click Update, and then those users will be granted the permissions. Of a rotation administrator over that rotation.

Setting Up Rotation Supervisors on Your Rotations 👨‍🏫
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about setting up rotation supervisors on your rotations. So in our various knowledge based articles and videos you will probably hear us talk about rotation supervisors fairly often because it's really the easiest way to get evaluations to match up with the
correct people for our, evaluation assignment algorithm. So all you need to know for adding these is that you go to system setup, rotations, and you can see I have a number of rotations here and if you look at this faculty and staff column if it has a, number there that indicates that it already has
rotation supervisors on the rotation. So these are probably the people that are doing the evals on your trainees that are going through the rotation.
So click on that we can get a But if we need to edit who's on this list or add new people or whatever is what we've got to do, we go to the first action button on the right, click that, and you'll see two tables.
So the table at the very top shows the list of people that are currently assigned as rotation supervisors. So if you needed to take one of these off, simply just uncheck the box in their name.
And below that is a list of all the other people that are eligible to be rotation supervisors. So these are going to be users that I, either faculty or staff user type.
So let's say Christopher Turk is no longer going to be faculty and staff but we're going to add Addison Montgomery.
Click that, click save, and that will have updated our IC rotation supervisors. So if we look at that now, we can see Addison's on there, and Christopher Tark is no longer.
And that is how you update and manage rotation supervisors on your rotation.

Syncing personal calendar
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about syncing your personal calendar in metrics to whatever your calendar preference is. So if you go from your personal portal to the calendar nav item and then if you look at the top right here we have sync with my calendar.
So this is the tool that will allow you to sync the events for your user in metrics with any of the calendars that you may be using.
And so we have instructions here for a number of the popular ones. So Google Calendar, Apple's iCal, and the last thing Microsoft Outlook.
So if you're using a calendar that is different from these, it's probably going to be very similar but you should look for specific instructions from that calendar's development.
Now if we go to Google here you can see we have the links to their documentation, so you are able to click on this and get taken to their documentation.
But again, And if you're using something else, you'll want to refer to that. But this is all you need here.
So if you just copy paste this link, this is a link to your unique calendar and metrics. And so if you paste that into your calendar application of choice, it will sync to it.
One quick note. Something that we cannot control is how often your calendar syncs to metrics. So it could be as often as every 10, 15 minutes, or it could be longer depending on the settings of your calendar.
So keep that in mind, particularly if you're an admin. If you're making any last minute changes to a calendar event, it might be best to take advantage of that email event invitees function.
When you're doing so to make sure everyone sees it because if it is a last minute change, it may not end up in people's personal calendars outside of metrics until this syncs and we do not have particular control over how often that occurs.

Creating Resources folders
Hi there. In this video we'll be going over creating resource folders. So in a previous video we went over what a resource is.
The resource is it's a document, it's a file, it's a link to something, it's something that someone wants to see, right?
And the best way to give that information to someone else is to organize it. So that's where on the resources page the folder structure comes into play.
So to create a new resource folder, you just go to the resources page, click on new folder, here you get to name the folder, so we'll be very creative here, we'll just call it new folder one, and then as you do, so you can choose who to share it with.
So this can occur via roles or groups, so users that match certain roles in your program, users that are part of particular groups in your program, can be given rights over a particular resource folder.
You can also add an admin user, so that is a user that would have admin rights over this specific resource folder and any of the things that go within it.
So this is good for people that do not need to have full admin rights over the program, but may need to have admin rights over a particular resource folder.
Down here, we can select who should be notified in case we add additional resources to the resource folder. So this will send an email out to folks.
If we add new documents or what have you, these people can be notified. So we can notify individuals here. You know, depending on what you do, depending on how often you're doing this, you may not want to spam people.
Perhaps once a resource folder has kind of reached you know, what it's going to have in it and we won't be editing it often, that would be a good time to actually notify folks instead of when you're still building the resource folder as this might send a bunch of emails.
While it is still being built. So this is a little better to turn on once the resources in the folder are kind of set.
And then once you select the individuals to notify, you can choose to send them that email notification when new stuff is added.
But we'll go ahead and just save the folder. New folder one. So we could see that here. And of course we can make folders within folders.
So if that helps for your organization, you can feel free to add new folders. And the interesting thing here, actually, let's do that.
Let's do that a little differently so you can see it. So let's put a couple of roles on here. So let's say that in general, this folder will be accessible to p2.1, 2, and 3 users, right?
So we save that. We click into new folder 1, and then when I create a new folder within that folder, I can choose all or only some of the people that match the roles.
So even though the parent folder, the main one, new folder 1. Is accessible to all roles, once they come in here, I can still further curate what people will see.
So if within this folder, only some of the items are relevant to a p2y1, p2y2, or p2y3 trainee, I can segment that.
So I can make a folder under this parent folder for only the p2y1. So that can be useful if we want to create a very specific environment where people only see what they need to see and they don't need to get into the other stuff until they reach that next role.

Hello, this video is to demonstrate how to generate the MSPE letters for the cohorts that you've created within the system.
So at this point, you have the charts ready to go, you have the merge fields ready to go, and you've edited the template.
To capture all of that information, once it's generated. So for actually generating the letters, you want to make sure you are under the admin portal in the top right, and we will scroll over here to grade book and generate MSPE.
So what we'll want to do is we'll select the template that we created, and then we will select the cohort that we created.
And it is as easy as that, because now we can just hit generate documents for group, we will put these status as draft, since it may need some editing.
And we will generate, make sure you want to generate this mini document. Or just draft will be processed, this process will take a while.
So it can take some time based on the volume, but we will select yes. And they are queued for generation and once they've generated it will populate this list.
We'll see you can see that we've already done it a couple times on this server, but it will create another set of new ones for us.
And that is how you generate the MSPEs.

Creating Calendar events
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about creating new calendar events, so I'm currently on the program portal We'll go to calendar on the left nav And so now that we're here there's gonna be a couple of different views you could choose from by default You're gonna see this timeline view Which is
particularly good for dealing with creating the events as you can always click into Specific cells to start the event at that time, but we also have week views as well as month views and also this list view Actually, let's go back to like July here so you can see better.
There you go. So there's the list view, month view, week view, and then finally our timeline view. So let's stick with let's see here.
Let's go to the current month and go to timeline view. Cause it's likely what you'll see when you log in at first.
So let's say we're going to have a 10 AM meeting on Tuesday, August 29th, right? So in order to do that, easy way is just to click into that cell and you'll see.
At the bottom that it has started at that time. The end time is always going to default to one hour after the start time.
You're free to change that. Well, let's talk about what's in here. So we have the event title. So we'll just call this morning conference, right?
We have our event type. So the event type is going to be used for a variety of things in reporting and also evaluation assignment, if we can be doing evaluations through your events.
So it is important. It also comes with some color coding options and we'll have another video going into the details of this.
But we'll leave it as conference for now. You can have the event description. So if you want to make any notes about what's going on at this event, you can add that there and people within metrics will be able to see that information.
Venue, where it takes place, just type that in there. And then we have both internal speakers and visiting speakers. So when it comes to internal speakers, you can actually select from different users.
So let's say Perry Cox is actually speaking at this event. And this field is particularly important when you're doing, let's say event evaluations which we'll cover in a different video.
But you'll want to make sure you set that up appropriately. And then we have visiting speakers which is good for when they do not have a user account in metrics, but you still want to let people know who's going to be speaking at the event.
You can type their name in here and that will be utilized. You can also upload documents to the event. If there's a specific PowerPoint or PDF or something that will be going over during the event, you can add that there and people can grab that through the event in metrics.
And then down, here, this next section is all about who is getting invited. So like with a lot of different things in metrics, you're going to be able to invite users by their role.
So let's say video by two and three. If you have created separate groups for your own purposes, you can also utilize those when creating events and editing events.
And then here it's just inviting individuals. So if you're inviting someone that doesn't happen to match into either of those two things, groups or roles, you can just add them individually here.
And then lastly, this option for only inviting users who have internal medicine as their primary program, right? So there may be other users affiliated with your program, but they're not expected to go to this event, right?
You're only want people that are part of your program coming to this event. So that's a good option to check on if you have a program set up that way.
And then at the bottom here, track attendance, yes or no. So this will allow you to track attendance at the event.
It's on by default. If you turn it off, attendance tracking is off for the event. So use that as appropriate.
And then down here is mandatory for all users selected, including those excuse rotations. And basically what that means is if you've scheduled a particular person to a rotation where you have.
Marked that rotation as excused then for attendance purposes they will be considered excuse for that rotation right for the dates that they are on that rotation if they coincide with when this event is created.
Now if I turn this on it means we're ignoring that and they're going to be it's mandatory or anyway. They need to come, right?
This is for cases where yes they're on let's just say a night float rotation you know we don't need them coming to the morning conference they should be asleep right but maybe there's some case where no you have to be here for this one right so that would be a case where you might turn on the mandatory
meeting. And then down here at the bottom you can adjust the date if you need. But we've already clicked into the appropriate time or the appropriate date from the timeline view and then here we can alter the start and end time and the nice thing about this I'd like to point out is if you click on these

Editing/deleting resource folders
Hi there. In this video, we'll be going over editing or deleting resource folders. So in a previous video, we went through and created a few folders.
So now we'll go about trying to delete them. So oh well, and edit them, right? So if we go to New Folder, one here, editing them is a simple process.
Just click on the pencil icon next to the resource folder. You would like to edit or technically the resource itself you would like to edit.
And here you can choose to change anything about it, right? So admin users who gets notified as well as who might have access to the particular folder can be edited at any time.
So if you accidentally granted access to someone that shouldn't have access, you can take them off here or change any of these other settings.
And this also applies to other things like the resource themselves. For example, if we go to handbooks, here's our attendance policy.
We can click on edit for that and then we can choose to replace the file. Or delete the specific resource using the trashcan icon here.
Or we could try to delete the entire folder. And so if the folder is empty, you'll be able to just do this outright, delete the resource, and there it goes, it's gone.
If it ever contains something, you will need to delete what it contains. And that's so we don't accidentally, you know, delete a parent folder, and oh, there it goes, the hundred things that I spent hours putting in there making sure everything was great by accident, right?
I'm allowed to delete the folder itself.

Overlaying calendar events from other programs
Hi there. In this video we're going over overlaying calendar events from other programs, so you'll see that I'm currently logged in under the internal medicine program and if I go to the calendar here, by default I will only be seeing calendar events for my program.
But if you who are in and out. It might be helpful to see when and where other programs are doing things, you can go here under customized calendar and then select the other programs and overlay their calendar onto yours.
So for example, I happen to know that this Friday Dermatology is having an event, so if I overlay their calendar, I can see that now I have the dermatology event and I can see information about it.

Editing calendar events
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about editing existing calendar events. So, to do so, we'll go from our program portal here to calendar on the left nav.
And then we'll go find the event we made the other day. There it is. So, we'll go back. We'll go back a little bit and go to our event.
So, here's the morning conference that we made a little earlier. So, really easy. All the same kind of rules apply as you edit an event as when you're making it.
So, if I just click on it, you'll see all this information. Information. That was entered previously will show up, right?
And then we can change the events. So, oftentimes you might be doing something like inviting extra users or setting a new end time.
And so, all of that is really just the same as when you're creating calendar events. The one thing I'm going to point out is specifically, though, is as you are saving the edited event, you're going to be asked again, just like you were when you created the event, if you want to let people know.
This is specifically with another email that gets sent out instantly after basically saying yes to all of the users. So you might want to consider that in some cases.
That's probably pretty handy if you are changing the start time or end time of the event on the same day, or maybe next day, something like that.
So you can let people know about the time change. So keep that in mind. That's the big thing when editing events.
Otherwise, everything is pretty good. It's pretty much the same as when you're creating the event. Thank you

overlaying shift schedules from your program
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how you can overlay shift schedules onto your program admin calendar. So we're here under the internal medicine program.
We'll go to our calendar on the left nav, like so. And then here, you'll see by default what I see when I come to this page is all of my program's calendar events.
So calendar events likely means things like conferences, meetings, stuff like that. Not necessarily like your work schedule, which is something that might be contained within shift schedules, right?
And so if I go to customize calendar here and then I go to shift schedules, I can choose a shift schedule to overlay.
And if I select this one, I happen to know there's some stuff going on here. I can overlay that shift schedule onto my calendar.
And this could be useful for a lot of different cases really. And oftentimes it's useful specifically for, say, conflict checking, right?
If we're looking at a specific user's calendar or something like that and checking conflicts with events that they have and shift schedules they're on and stuff like that, all that can be done using this tool.
And then I can simply remove it to hide them again. But this will also be available in all the different views.
So this is on the timeline view. We can see it in the week view. Of course, we could see in the month view and it will overlay that shift schedule onto whatever view you choose.

overlaying an individual users schedule
Hi there. In this video we're going over how to overlay an individual user's calendar on top of your own program admin calendar.
So we're here under the internal medicine program. I'm going to go to the calendar on my left nav here. And so this individual's filter here.
Here is what we're looking for. So this is a really useful feature. Particularly when it comes to conflict checking. So if you're thinking about rescheduling someone on their shifts or something that they might be doing in metrics, it's really helpful to overlay their calendars perhaps with other people
as well. Perhaps with other things like shift schedules. Or other programs' calendars. And so basically all you need to do is search for the user, click here, and this will pull in their calendar as well.
So you can see John Dorian here is on continuity clinic AM from 8 to 12 every day. So yes, he's going to have a conflict with our morning conference here and that is obvious if we take it out.
Then we're left with only our individual program calendar events again. Add him back. And then we get his events again.
So again, this is particularly helpful for any kind of event. Kind of conflict checking across your program's calendar.

Creating/editing calendar events in a series
Hi there. In this video, we're going over creating or editing events in a series. So to do this, we'll go to Calendar on our left nav.
And so this is basically a very good function for when you're working with an event that's going to be on a pretty regular cadence, you know, every 10 a.m.
Tuesday every week for the year. Something like that, right? So instead of making those all separately, you can make a repeating event to deal with that.
So let's do exactly that. Let's say on Tuesdays at 10 a.m., we're going to have our morning conference, right? Okay, we'll invite some folks here.
About one, two, three. And then the important part for this video is down here at the bottom creating the repeating events.
So when you do this, there's basically two ways you can do it. You could specify like a weekly rule, right?
So in this case, the rule will be Tuesdays and then, our start date here would be September 19th and this would end whenever we decide it will end.
So let's just say December 30th, right? So every Tuesday between this current event that we're making and that end date is going to make another repeating event.
So if you have a pretty regular calendar when it comes to these things, it pays off to just make kind of like a skeleton, say hey, every Tuesday I know we're having morning conference, make the event, and then you can come edit the event with the specifics.
So let's just do something like that. And we'll, we'll keep that cadence. And there we go. So we've got our morning conference for that.
And then we'll see that kind of happens throughout the rest of the year now. Right? So when you're making a skeleton like this, though, it might pay off where you leave it kind of blank.
You know maybe you have different speakers coming in. Maybe you have a different venue, different descriptions. All that kind of stuff.
But you've made the general outline of what your calendar events are going to be. Now you can come in and edit it and add more information.
So, more information, right? And so I do this specifically because when you click save, you're going to get this additional option because you can make the edit to this specific event.
So if whatever I entered in that description is really only relevant for the event on that day, then hit this event.
If that's going to be something that's relevant today and it's going to be applied moving forward, maybe some change in venue, for instance, where we used one room at the beginning of the year halfway through the year we changed to a new venue, right?
This would be a good use case for that for this and future events in the series. And then lastly here, all events in the series, which is where we're basically just editing the whole series.
Whatever I changed here will be applied to all of the events, both past, present, and future. So keep that in mind when you are making edits to events, you will want to pick the appropriate option here.
Alright? And then once you click yes, you still have the option with the email, just like we do when creating and editing events normally.
Now the other thing to go over here is the other method for creating and repeating events. So if your events do repeat, but they do not repeat on a regular like weekly cadence like this, then we can use this option here, specify dates.
So basically instead of setting a rule, like a weekly repeating rule, we can just pick a number of dates from our list, whatever they happen to be, and then the events will be created on those dates.
So that's good for when you have, you do have a regular meeting. It happens every month, but the specific day and time that it happens may be different, right?
So this is a good use case for when you need to create repeating events, but not necessarily on a regular weekly kind of cadence.

Using a QR code for calendar events
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how to set up the QR code for calendar events for your program so that people from your program can sign in to events and mark themselves as attended through that QR code.
So, if we go to the left nav here and we'll click on calendar. At the very top, you'll see we have a button for calendar QR code.
And so, if we click on this, we'll have a couple different options. There's also some information here. But basically, people can scan this QR code and they'll be taken to a page.
Where they can select the event that they are signing into and can mark themselves as intended. They can do so by being signed into the system already.
In which case, it'll just pick it up and note them as intended. Or they can enter the email address of the of their user account and metrics in order to sign in.
But to make this all happen, you need to put this QR code code somewhere. So you have two options to do so.
You could print the QR code, which will basically print this PDF as shown here, and you can paste this wherever you need to on the wall pin it up to the bulletin board, all that kind of stuff.
So this will allow you to generate this PDF that already has a couple of instructions on it. If you want to do something more, you can also download the QR code, which will download the image, and then you're free to do with that as you wish and make it into your own thing if you would like.
And so the other thing to note is also identified here on the page, but basically this QR code does not need to be changed out.
This is for your program, so it will remain up to date with your program's calendar, so you do not need to print out a new QR code for every event or every month or anything like that.
It's just a, perpetual QR code and it's going to pull from data in the system. So as you change things in the system, it will also be updated.

Manually Logging attendance for events
Hi there, in this video we're going over how you can manually log attendance for your calendar events. So if we'll go to the left nav here, we'll click on calendar, and we'll go to the Log Attendance tab.
So on this page you will see all the different events that you're probably seeing. This program has that have at least started, so any future events that may exist but have not actually began yet, they will not be shown here, but they will show up as time goes on.
And so note that at the top we do have some filters that could be helpful in identifying specific events if you're looking for some.
Something quite specific, by name, by type, stuff like that. And then down here, once we've identified the particular event we want to log, we can click on log attendance.
And then here, we have a couple of different options. So each one separately represents a different person that was invited to the event, so we can mark them as attended, as needed.
We can mark people as excuse rotation. Late. You know, all these different statuses can be applied as needed to the different people invited to the event.
And then also there are some filtering options up here, so if I just want to see everyone that was absent, and then I wanted to mark them all as attended.
I can do so. Right? So now they have all become attended. I can also do that same trick by selecting a few people, and then marking the selected folks as attended.
So if you don't want to click on each one, you can just click on each person that attended. And then hit mark selected as attended.
And that will only mark those folks as attended. And you can also apply a role filter here. So, PGY1s and so on.
Oh, well none of them are absent anymore, right? There you go. So here's all the PGY1s and, You can also filter by the status as well as first name, last name here in the search field.

Signing into an event via QR Code/mobile device
Hi there! In this video we're talking about how it works to sign in to an event via a QR code or on your mobile device.
So this goes hand in hand with collecting event attendance for calendar events, so if we go to Calendar here, you can see that I've made a morning conference that we're gonna use as our example here.
An important thing to note about the QR code and, I guess, attendance in general is attendance is only gonna work for people that you've invited by role.
So, let's add, some users here by role. And now, for these folks, they're gonna be eligible to actually get records get credit for going to this conference.
So, the QR code, as you probably know from other videos, can be found here. You can basically paste this, print it out, put it wherever you need to put it.
People can scan it with their phones, and then mark themselves as attended to the event, so you don't need to take any additional action.
It'll just get saved in the system. So, there's two ways of that works. So, this tab here this is from the perspective of a user that is already logged into metrics when they scan the QR code.
You can tell easily, because I got my photo in the top right corner there. And so, in cases like this there's really nothing else they need to do besides just click the check in button.
You are checked in, and then they are it's handled, so they are marked as attended for that particular event. The other way this works is if I scan the QR code while I am not actually logged into the system, that'll look something like this instead.
And so, when that happens, it does not log me in automatically and mark the code. It doesn't mark me as intended for the event because it doesn't know who I am.
I'm not logged in. But what I can do is I can enter an email, and if that email checks out and belongs to one of the users that are part of the event, I can check into it and then I get marked as a part of the event.

Creating a Brand New Case Template 🎉
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about creating a brand new case template. So, basically, a case template is the means that a trainee of whatever kind will use to log their case logs.
And there's a lot of different things you could do with case logging and these case templates, but we're just going to cover the basics here of getting a new case.
Template made. So from your left nav you'll want to go to cases and then templates. From here you'll see a list of any templates that already exist but you can go ahead and click new case template.
You will then be shown a list of case templates that exist elsewhere in the system. So if you're an institution where there are many different programs and they have already created their cases You may be able to just pick one of these and use it In other cases, you'll just click continue and move on
and from here you can now create your own case template Now there's gonna be other videos in these series that go over all of the Things that are on here just for the basics.
Keep it a name. I'm not very creative today. So I'm just gonna give it a name. Middle number for credentialing type case log in most cases, a description that will be displayed to the user when they see it or when they select it.
So if you're there, please do so. And then we have approval needed, whether a faculty member needs to sign off on the case or whether they're just logging it to log it, and then a minimum performance level as well.
Minimum performance level is used primarily in conjunction with approvals being needed, so whoever's doing the approval will select. A mid- or performance level and that will then count towards credentialing or not depending on how it's selected.
But look for another video with more details on that. There are several default fields that we can enable that can be utilized on the case log.
There's diagnoses fields that we can enable. There's some rules that we can apply here about when certain students can do any of these case templates that we create.
At the bottom we have the ability to add some custom questions later. But just to keep it simple for now we just created a case we call it give it a name.
Click Save and that's it. We have now created a case template.

How to Deactivate or Reactivate a Case Template
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about how to deactivate or reactivate one of your program's case templates.
So there could be a variety of reasons that you want to do this. We're not going to cover all those reasons here.
We're just going to focus on the actual function. So if we go to cases on our left nav, go to templates, we'll see of all of our currently active templates.
If you want to see a list of any inactive templates, you could just take this filter by status field, set it to inactive, and then you can see a number of older inactive cases.
So if we set this back to active and we decide, hey, I want to. Take this ABG, arterial blood gas, and I want to make it inactive for whatever reason, I could hover over here, click on this Deactivate button in yellow, and that will deactivate the template.
And so you can see now I can go to the Inactive tab. I'll see you at a, somewhere here, there's arterial blood gas, and I could reactivate it if I see fit.
And so that is how you can change the status of a case template from inactive, back to active, and back again, however many times you might need to.

Creating/Removing calendar adminstrators
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about creating calendar administrators as well as how to remove them from that position.
So to do so, we'll go to calendar on our left nav. And now just a quick overview of what a calendar admin is.
Basically, it's someone that you're going to give full rights to your program's calendar too. So these folks will be able to do all the same stuff that you can as a program administrator, except they'll be doing it from the personal portal.
And this would be the only kind of administrator thing that they would have access to. So you can see we have a number.
Of different calendar admins right now. We can easily just click on delete to remove their permission and then to add calendar permissions for folks.
We can just search for their name, add the user, click the add button, and now this person will have calendar rights over your program.
And then whenever we need to, we can then remove people from having those rights. And that will go into effect pretty much immediately.
So as soon as you give them permission, they will be able to do so. As soon as you remove it, they will no longer be able to do so.

Importing Case Templates from Other Programs at Your Institution 📊
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about importing case templates from other programs at your institution. So of course if you're only using Metrics as the only program at your institution, you're not going to get too much mileage out of this video.
But if you are at an institution that uses Metrics from multiple programs, you may have the opportunity to, to pull in a case template from another program instead of creating it from scratch.
And that can have some advantages when it comes to certain institutional level reporting, as well as credentialing, to keep all the data under the one case template, as opposed to making separate ones and splitting the data and all the possible issues that can help them back.
So if you are, or in this scenario, you can go to cases on your left nav, go to templates, and so you'll click create new case template and the first screen you will be greeted by will be a list of all the other case templates at your institution.
So you can search to find different case templates. That are utilized or if you just see it in the list you can click on it, select it, and click continue and what it'll do is it will pull in whatever data might be on there as far as the name and the the basic settings on the case template.
Now what's important to note is you still have control over what fields are enabled on the case template, what your minimum number of credentialing is, doesn't require approval.
So this is all still your choice as the program. However, it's just linked up in the backend of our system.
So when you're running certain kinds of reports, We know that this kind of case exists once in the institution, and it's just that two programs have different sets of ways of doing it, but it's the same thing.
And so that helps with some of our higher level reporting. So we do encourage you to do this if the opportunity is there to import the case template from another program.

Selecting and Deselecting Fields on Case Templates 👨‍💼
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about selecting or deselecting what fields appear on your case templates when one of your trainees attempts to log a case using that template.
So to take a look at this, we'll go to cases on our left nav, we'll go to templates, and we're just going to edit one of our existing templates.
So that's an important thing. To note here that you are not locked in to what fields will appear on your case template after you created or after it's been used.
You can come in here and change it later if you decide that hey we're not really getting any useful information from having this field on there then you can just go ahead and remove it.
And that's something we actually recommend here so let's talk about this a lot more. The ABG case here, click on edit, and so you've probably already seen this section as you were creating the case template.
And so just a couple of things that we recommend about these fields. So these are all default fields that exist in the system.
There is a capability for you to make your own custom fields and over that in another video. But in general, when we're talking about logging cases, trainees tend to do a lot of these, right?
And so it can be important to limit the fields that you select here to only the absolute ones that you know you need.
Because every time you add, or you ask a trainee to add more information, it makes it kind of less likely that they're gonna, do it or less likely that they're going to do it correctly.
And that goes for everybody, right? Simplicity is always important. So keep that in mind as you select some of these fields.
And so to change it, it's just as simple as selecting it or deselecting the various fields. And so I just wanted to make a couple of notes about a few of them.
So clinical setting this is a drop-down field and basically there's a preset list of different types of settings that the case might Have taken place out that they will choose from There's a clinical site which is going to be a list of all the sites that are available metrics and they can note which
one they went to So Feedback duration is a number field where if they received feedback from a preceptor or faculty member they can say how long that took.
There's identification number which is used as a unique ID for any means for the case log. Indication and other text field note and other separate text field.
Patients age, we display both a year and month value here if you turn this on. So in some cases people don't need to use the month value of course when you're not dealing with infants and so patient gender.
You can turn that on. That's drop-down list case duration like feedback duration is basically. Saying how long did it take.
Preceptors is an interesting field so if you have approval needed set to true or on or yes this means that a faculty member will need to be selected on the case and they will have approval rights.
A preceptor is someone other than that. So some of that may have been involved in the case in some way, but doesn't actually have the approval rights over the case.
So that's what this field is for. And this v, which is another drop down summary of patient education, just another specialized text field.
And then these two at the bottom here are also important. How do you think you performed? This basically allows the trainee to select one of these fields for a minimum performance level and basically say, I think I performed at this level.
And so whoever is approving the case can see that and basically say, hey, yes, I agree or they might have a different opinion.
And then this checkbox here, which is gonna be turned on by the fault for most cases where approval is needed, they're going to be required to select a performance level so they cannot approve the case as a faculty member unless they select from one of the performance levels.
And so those are our default fields. You can of course create more, but in general we do like to recommend.
That you limit this to what you absolutely need to have on your case logs to make it a little easier on everyone to both log and review this data.

Creating Custom Questions for Case Logs
Hi there, in this video we're going to discuss creating custom questions to use on your case logs. So this is for scenarios where any of the default fields that you can enable or disable on our case templates doesn't quite get the information you're trying to get, so we have the ability for you to basically
make your own. So to do so, we'll go to cases, custom questions. And so from here, I already have one example just so that we get looked at.
So age range. In metrics, we have a field for age, which allows you to enter any number for the age.
So if someone's 17, they're 17. If they're 35. To 35. With this, this is better if you're doing your reporting more specifically on age ranges rather than looking for something with very specific age data.
So you can add your own question and you can see I've created my own answer choices here for 025. 26 to 50, you know, whatever you want to do.
And so let's talk about doing one of these from scratch. So we click Add Custom Case Question, and then we ask whatever the question is.
So I'm not feeling too creative here. So we're going to do question number one, right? And so that's our first question.
We can also provide any additional descriptions that you might use here. So description for question one. And so that'll be displayed along with the question when it's applied to a case template later.
Then we have this section which is pretty interesting, fulfilled during. And so basically what this means is we can select whether it's the trainee that is going to fill out this question or we could actually have the faculty member that's supervising and approving the case fill out this question.
This can be used for a lot of different cases. And in most cases, it is the trainee answering the questions.
However, you can ask the faculty member to fill out a specific question as they are approving a case. But we're going to leave this at the default for trainee.
And then we have the options for question type. So we have checklist, multiple choice, and text. So checklist and multiple choice are pretty similar to one another.
The difference being that on checklist, you can select multiple answers to it, whereas on multiple choice, you have to pick one.
So let's just do a quick ad here. So I'm just going to add. A couple of options here. And so when I add options like this, whether it's a checklist or multiple choice, the options are the same, right?
So no big difference there. It's just with a checklist. What I'm answering this question on the case log, I can select one, two, three, four altogether.
1, 2, and 3, it doesn't matter. I can select multiple. Whereas if I have this set to multiple choice, I can only select one of these.
And over time, it is possible that your answer choices might change, so you do have the ability to deactivate older answer choices that you don't want to keep on your case log template.
But you do probably want to keep the underlying data that was previously linked to it. So that's a good case for deactivating.
And of course, while these things are still fresh and new, you might be better off just deleting them entirely. So I'll just delete these couple here.
And then the last one we have is just text, which is pretty self-explanatory. It's going to be a text. Field that appears people can put in there whatever it is you want them to put in there and for the text display option we have text field so that's going to be shorter a little easier to work with
if it's a shorter answer and not something that they have to write a whole thing about but if they do have to write a little bit more then you probably want the text area which is going to be easier to work.
With as they could see more of their text as they write it as opposed to the text field. And then the last two sections here are hide responses or make question required.
So hide responses, if you turn that on, basically we'll hide that response from the other person here. So we have the trainee.
And then we have the supervisor or faculty member that's doing the approval. If you turn this on, the trainee will answer it, but the supervisor will not see it in this scenario, or if we flip it.
In this case, the supervisor will answer it, but the trainee will not be able to see it. So that can be utilized if you wanna collect something maybe a little more confidential in the case logs about the training or about the faculty member.
And then this one pretty self-explanatory make the question required. So anytime that we apply this question to a specific case template it will be required in order to be able to submit that case template.

How to Apply Custom Questions to Case Templates
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about how to apply any customer questions you've created to your case templates.
So a quick review here, we can allow you to enable or disable our default questions and fields on a case template or you could choose to create your own.
If you chose to create your own, you can go to cases. Custom questions and see them all here. You might have some are active, some are inactive, but now I actually want to apply one of these custom questions to one of my case templates.
So to do that, I will go to cases, templates. I'm going to pick chest to be. Click Edit. Now if we scroll down to the bottom we'll see this section for additional info and this is basically where you could build in all these custom questions that you've added.
So you can use this in conjunction with our default field so you could turn on all the default. Fields. You can have diagnoses, you can have procedures, you can do all that stuff, but you can also create your own.
So you can mix them together or keep them completely separate and do all custom questions. It's really up to you in the program.
But once you're down on add new section. So when this is displayed to the trainees volume cases, the section is shown first.
And so we'll just call it section one here. And once I create a section, I can then add questions to that section.
So I'll add my age range question to that section. I can then add additional sections if I want to break up these questions in some particular way.
Come here and then add whatever my other questions are to that section. And then the students or trainees or residents or whoever is filling out these case logs will either need to answer these questions if they've been made required.
Or can answer these questions if they are optional. And so that's all there is to it when it comes to adding these custom questions to one of your case logs.

Creating a List of Diagnoses for Case Templates
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about creating a list of diagnoses that can be used on your case templates.
So this can be useful when you have a very specific set of diagnoses that you want to keep consistent and you want to do some stats on, you know, how many, how many of this diagnosis on average do my residents see and things.
Like that. So if you want to go and set these up, you would go to cases, templates, and you'll see a tab at the top here that says manage diagnoses.
And so there's two parts to diagnoses. One is the category and the other is the diagnosis itself. So if you click on Manage Categories, if you're just starting, this will be blank.
You see I have a bunch of random data here. So basically I can create any category that I want, and then when I create a diagnosis, I can then add that diagnosis under that category.
I can also delete those categories if I want to reorganize things later. So if I go to Add Diagnosis, first step is I select the category.
So there's a lot of different ways to categorize this stuff. There's no right or wrong way, but just know that when your trainee is created on case logs, they will see the category.
So think of that as something that they might search and want to find, or in this case if we're doing it by specialty for instance, we might only include these diagnoses on our cardiology related case log templates, right, to make it easy.
So something to think about good categorization always has its benefits. Under that we might put our diagnosis, so I'm just going to do CHF for example.
And keep in mind that you do want to create diagnoses names that people will know and look for, right? So if you commonly refer to congestive heart failure as CHF, you might want to just put CHF in there, right?
Because that's what people are going to say, that's what people are going to look for. So keep that in mind that these are going to be terms that they only need to find in And keep that in mind that these are going to be terms that people are going to look instead of logging their case logs.
Here we have an ID. This is just used if you have a very particular way of doing this. If you're, say, I think of this similar to ICD-10 codes, you could do something like that in your ID, but it is not a required field.
And the same with minimum acquired. If there is some number that you want to track of, hey, I want I want you to see 10 of these before you're done with this program or whatever the number might be.
You can put that here and you can later use that in some of our reporting to see if people are meeting on that requirement.
So click save there that will create the new diagnosis and it will exist here. At this point I can come in here and edit it if I will.
I can also delete it entirely since it hasn't been used yet. It will be available for me to delete or If I want to deactivate one I can do that and click Deactivate there and then if I ever want to bring it back I can go to inactive set up active active and that will bring it back to my active tab.
So keep that in mind. And the most important thing here is to realize that people will be searching for this in drop-downs and so to categorize and name these things in

Creating Procedures for Case Log Templates 📝
Hi there. In this video, we're going to be talking about creating procedures to appear on your case log templates for your trainees to blog against.
And so now if you're watching this video, chances are you are not going to be from a GME program. And this has more uses in the UME nursing.
Allied health programs that it doesn't GME and I'll explain quickly why. And I'm under a UME program here. If I go to cases and templates, most UME programs will have just a few different case log templates.
In this case, I have one called patient log. And so on this, they'll be able to choose a variety of procedures that they may have seen during that specific encounter.
Whereas in a GME program, you will more often see the case templates actually representing the procedures themselves. And that is mostly due for credentialing purposes.
But in the UME world and nursing world and allied health world. There's a better use case for doing procedures using this function that I'm about to show you.
And so you can do this under cases and templates, which is where we are now, and then go to manage procedures.
So if you've watched our other video about managing diagnoses, it's basically the same idea, except it's just separate field. But it's the exact same concept where I can create categories to put these under.
And a good use case for these is to group them by specialty even because that allows us to do a few more interesting things when it comes to when we display the procedures and perhaps only during certain rotations are we going to display these procedures.
Which will link to certain case templates and so on. And we can make this a very curated experience for people where they're only logging very specific things during very specific rotations.
So we'll just go ahead and make a category here. So category one. And so I'm just gonna call this cardiology for the sake of making something.
Here. So I've made a category and now that I've made a category I can then add procedures underneath it. And important thing to note here is that your trainees will probably be searching for things under the procedures and diagnoses lists.
So you want to make sure that when you categorize and when you name these things, you do so in a way where people are likely to find it.
So using cardiology as an example here. So let's do cardiology and let's say we're gonna do something related to congestive heart failure, some like procedure you would do under congestive heart failure.
You probably, or you could use the term CHF. A lot of people just say CHF, they don't say the whole thing, they don't think about the whole thing, they just say CHF.
So you just want to think about how people think about certain procedures, any acronyms they might use, anything that makes it easier to find things as people are searching through these lists.
So just keep that in mind as you create these lists. Maybe don't want to get too technical. To go with some of the things, you just want to make sure that people are selecting the correct thing as they are logging through the cases.
You have an ID field here which is optional. This just helps keep things lined up. It can also be searchable.
So a good use case for these is actually ICD-10 codes. If you're using something like that, those could be entered here.
And then minimum. If you have some kind of guideline for I want each of my students to see X amount of this Diagnoses or X amount of these procedures before graduating you can enter that number here And that's something we can track against when we do reporting later on so click Save there And that's
it you've created one of your procedures. And you can repeat this process until you have all the procedures you need or if you have quite a few to make, you can also use this button here to mass import procedures using the template here and you can find another video about how to do that in our knowledge
base.

Bulk Importing Diagnoses for Case Templates 📊
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about bulk importing diagnoses to be used on your case templates. In an earlier video we already went over how you might go creating these diagnoses one by one and if you're not dealing with a particularly long list, that's probably fine.
However, you might be dealing with a particularly long list, so in cases like that you can Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about bulk importing diagnoses to be used and go to cases and then templates, go to manage diagnoses, and we've already gone over another video how to create these one
by one, and this is basically to use all the same fields and all the same concepts, except you'll be able to do it in bulk using a spreadsheet.
And so this is particularly useful when you start getting into very high volumes. And also, perhaps you've taken this list from somewhere else and you already have it in a format where you can just kind of put it in our format and upload it into the system quite easily.
So to do so, click on Import Diagnosis. Here. Click on download template. It will download a template that will look something like this.
Once my Excel actually opens it, it's coming. I promise. There it is. And so here's the template. And so if we look at it, these are all the same fields that you might, use when creating these things manually.
So we have the category ID and category name. We have the diagnosis ID and name. And then if there is a bit of a number required, you can put that here.
And so as an example, you will want to remove this row here. That just tells you more about the fields before you attempt any upload.
You'll want to get rid of that. But otherwise you could pretty much follow this kind of format. Of course you'll have to use your own categories and category IDs and such but if you take this and re-upload it into the system like so.
Bit upload. You can see it quickly made those two different diagnoses I had on there. So basically take that same concept and apply it to 2000 diagnoses or more.
However many you're trying to make you can quickly create them in metrics using this import function instead of making them one by one.

Hi there. In this video we'll be going over importing procedures to be able to use on our case templates. So in an earlier video you might have seen how you might go about creating all of these procedures one by one to be made on your templates, but there's a pretty decent chance you don't want to do
that and you actually have quite a few of these that you need to make. So in the earlier video you might have seen how you might go about creating all of these cases it might be faster to use our import function.
So if you go to cases on the left nav and then go to templates, go to manage procedures, and then instead of making these all one by one like we did in the previous video, we can use the template here on the import procedures button, click download template, and we'll open this one up.
And so this will give you a bit of instruction, but it's basically the same as what you did on creating these one by one in the previous video, except going to do this in a spreadsheet and book.
And this can be particularly helpful, especially if you're getting this list from somewhere else. And you just need to make a couple of tweaks to put it in our format here.
And you can do a quick mass upload. So if we look at all the fields that are shown here, these are all the same fields that we had when we were actually making the procedures.
So we have a category ID. We have a category name. And we have a category name. Procedure ID, procedure name, and then a minimum required if the procedure has some value that you're trying to get the students to see a minimum of.
So first thing you'll want to do is get rid of this row with the instructions. We don't need that and at that point you are free to start making all the different procedures that you need and it's the same as if you're making them, on the front end one by one, but you're just using the spreadsheet to
make it go a bit faster. And so if we come back to our template app, I can do an upload of one I had worked on previously here.
Click submit. And you can see I quickly created those two procedures using the import file. So basically take that same concept and apply it to a thousand, two thousand procedures, whatever you're trying to put in the system.
And it will save you quite a bit of time.

Limiting Diagnoses in Case Templates 📋
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about limiting what diagnoses will appear when your trainees are using a particular case template.
So there are a number of reasons why you may want to do this, among them being basically limiting what people can choose to make sure that they don't pick something that they really shouldn't, that maybe sounds similar, and that maybe sounds similar, and that maybe sounds similar.
Things like that. So if we go to cases, templates, this will be on the template itself. So in this case, we just have a generic one called patient log, though in the ways that you set this up, you might get more specific.
Let's say that there's a family medicine case template, and then you only apply family meta-simulated diagnoses to that case template.
So if we open this one up, go to Edit Log, scroll down to this section here, and we have Manage Diagnoses.
So the first thing to do is to turn on the fields. So you'll notice that there is both a primary and secondary diagnosis field.
You can deal with these separately if you wish, or you can just turn on primary, and they'll be able to pick from the same list regardless of what they're doing.
But what you can see here is all the available diagnoses appear on the left, and then whatever diagnoses, added to the specific template appear on the right.
So if under primary diagnosis I only want to display abdominal pain I can do so. So the only option that would appear at this point under the diagnosis section would be abdominal pain.
Of change and surround, add multiple as much as I need. There's also search fields here if you're dealing with much larger lists of what you need to manage.
But basically what you want to do is select the specific diagnoses that you want to appear in each of the fields.
Now note that you can also record. These fields. So if you want to require the primary diagnosis field or require the secondary diagnosis field you can also do that while you're in this section.
But our recommendation is that if possible to limit the diagnoses that appear on particular case logs because whenever you're dealing with shorter lists, you're more likely to get your trainees to log accurate data as opposed to dealing with larger lists that just kind of include everything.
That leads to greater chances of people spiking the wrong thing that maybe sounds similar but within the context are not quite the same thing.
So you can use these sections to add and remove. Which diagnoses will appear in each of the diagnoses fields. And then when you're done, simply go to the bottom and click Save, and then only those diagnoses will be available to use when your trainees are logging this specific template.

Limiting Procedures on Case Templates 📝
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about limiting what procedures that your trainees can log against on your case templates.
So there are a number of reasons why you may want to do something like this, but effectively it boils down to making sure that we're providing shorter, more accurate lists to the trainees when we're trying to ask them to log their cases.
Right? So in case there's similar sounding procedures or maybe the same procedure in different contexts, we want to track them differently.
We are showing them only the correct ones all the time so we don't have any issues of mislogged cases. So to do this you would go to cases, templates, We'll use our patient log as an example, click on edit.
We'll scroll down to this section here for managed procedures. So first you will want to turn the field on. So without enabling the field, no procedure field will be shown and thus none will be selectable.
But once you're here. You can then choose which of the procedures that you want to display on this particular template.
So let's pretend this is a family medicine template, so I probably want to display both of them, right? So I'm showing family medicine procedures on a family medicine template.
Now, Note that we could also use research functions here to make it easy to find certain cases and everything is going to be searchable here.
The name, the category, as well as any ID. In this case, there is no ID, but those are also searchable.
All here so it's very easy to find if you've already created procedures. So keep that in mind as you're adding procedures here and once you are done and you've added them to the right here of course you can remove them at any time if you wish but once you've added the procedures just scroll down to
the bottom. Click Save and this will now only allow those specific procedures that you've selected to be used when logging against this template.

Limiting Case Logging by Rotation Schedule 🔄
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about limiting who can log a certain case based on their rotation schedule.
So there's a variety of reasons you might want to do this but effectively it boils down to making sure that when someone logs a case they're they're Hi there.
In this video we're going to talk about limiting who can log a certain medicine rotation, we're not seeing a bunch of questions surrounding surgery cases, right?
And so we can do this by going to cases and templates. We'll edit this existing template. We've been using, as an example, we'll scroll down to this section here of where you can set the this up.
So the section is called settings to limit by rotation and or by roll. And so the by rotation section is a little bit special because it's got a couple rules associated with it.
So the first thing you want to do is pick the rotation that you can apply here. So if we pick medicine here, like we mentioned, you'll notice that it's been added to the field.
And so what this will do is it will only allow this specific case log template to be used by trainees that have a schedule against this rotation.
Right now that schedule can exist at any given point in time. So it could be an old schedule that already happened or it could be something in the future.
The only thing this field cares about is that they have the rotation. So there are some use cases for doing something like that.
Let's say that people really only do this rotation in their third or fourth year of training or whatever it might be.
So it might make sense to just add it on there and they'll see it once they might have the ability to actually.
Do that rotation. But in most cases, you also want to make use of this specific field below it that is now enabled, where it says only allow trainees to log cases x days after the end of the rotation.
So what this will do is if we turn this on. And let's say let's set this value to something like seven.
So now the system will actually look at the rotation schedule that the trainee is currently on. So currently means on the date that they are logging the case, it will check to see what schedules they are on and it will only display templates relevant to the specific rotation schedule there.
On. So in many use cases, this is helpful. So let's say the student is on a family medicine rotation, they will only see the family medicine template.
So there's no chance of them using the incorrect template to log a case when they should have used something else, because we're limiting their options.
And so what this will do is also allow them to log their cases against that. Template for a certain amount of days after that schedule ends.
So if your institution has some kind of policy that says, you must have all your case log templates or case logs submitted by x days after rotation ends, this is a good place to put that same number.
Because this way, once that rotation is over and they can no longer log against it. This case template will now no longer appear.
And of course you can always remove these settings if you wish, but if this kind of scenario makes sense to you, it's a good chance that you will want to enable these to limit what cases can be used and when to make your case logs as clean as they can't be in terms of data.

Limiting Template Access by Role 🚫
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about limiting who can log certain cases based on their role within metrics.
And so there are a couple of different reasons why you might do something like this. But what it boils down to is that you want to limit trainees options and by limiting their options get more accurate.
Data. So to do this you will go to cases and then templates. We're going to use our example patient log here and if we scroll down a bit we will see a section that says settings to limit by rotation and, or by a role.
So we will find another video that we provided previously for doing the by rotation and what that all means. So we'll just focus on the role here.
And it's pretty simple. If the user matches or currently matches the role that is selected here, they will be able to log against this template.
If they do not match the rules, they will not see the template. And so let's say that whatever rotation or template that this is for, they're not going to do it until they reach their fourth year training.
So let's say we're a medical school. And so we can limit this by MS4. So only users that currently match this role will be able to log against this template.
And if the user doesn't match the role, they won't even see it. They won't be able to log against it.
And if you want to use the same kind of concept against a residency role, that would be typical in the GME environment.
We could say they won't do this template until they're PGY4, PGY5. So same concept is you have to be this role to be able to actually log against this template, otherwise you won't even see it.
And this could help limit options and make sure that people are using the correct templates to log instead of accidentally picking the wrong one from a list and then messing up your data.
And so once you're done editing this, click the Save button. And that's it. Now, those users will only be able to access this template if they match the roles that we put on here.

Medtrics - 23 June 2023
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about automatic procedure or case credentialing and how the system's logic works to make that happen.
So if we look at cases and templates you'll see that in this program we have a number of different cases.
In this case we're treating the cases effectively as procedures and then we have a minimum required number and we also have supervisor approval needed.
So if we take a look at say arterial line placement this will be a good example to take a look at.
So if we click on edit we could see the settings come in. So we have this minimum number of credentialing set to five.
Approval is needed from the faculty member that oversaw the particular case or procedure. And then we have a minimum performance level.
And so it's these three things that work together to automatically determine at what point a resident, or whoever has become credentialed on a particular procedure or case type.
So the way this works is it interacts very heavily with the minimum performance level. So in order to meet the minimum for credentialing, they must get their case logged and approved five times.
While meeting the minimum performance level, which right now is set pretty high, which is performed with minimal assistance, right? Whatever that means, the person doing the approval.
And so if they log the case and they get something at a lower, level like say observed or performed with significant assistance then it will not count towards their minimum number for credentialing.
It will only count if it meets that minimum or above. It does not count if it doesn't meet the minimum.
So that's an important thing to notice if you have a trainee that has logged 20 of the case but is still not credentialed in it, there's a decent chance that perhaps they only observed a good number of them and they have not actually performed enough at the level to be considered credentialed.
So the way this works is the system checks when each case is submitted if this trainee or user now meets the criteria where they have had the minimum number of five approved cases where this minimum performance level is met.
And if that is true, they will be considered a credentialed in the case. And one quick place to just find this out is if we go to credentials in the top right and we can see, searches by a trainee or by a procedure.
So if I just select one of my trainees here, I can see all the cases they were credentialed in, how many times they performed it in total, which status they fell into, whether it's without any assistance, with minimal assistance, with significant, assistance or only observed and the date that they were
credentialed. So one of the ways that they could be credentialed is that this automatic process considers them credentialed based on that criteria.

Manual Procedure or Case Credentialing 📝
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss manual procedure or case credentialing. So in a previous video you might have seen us discuss how the automatic case credentialing works.
So we'll do a quick review of that. So if we go to cases and templates. And we'll use arterial line placement as an example here.
Click on Edit. We have a minimum number for credentialing, we have approval needed, and we have a minimum performance level.
So this means for a trainee or a user to become credentialed in this procedure, they must complete it. At least five times, it must be approved by a faculty member each time, and they must meet the minimum performance level for each of those cases.
If one of those cases is then observed, they will not have met the minimum performance level and they will not be credentialed by the administrator metrics you have the ability to manually credential a user and this can be done from the users page.
So I'll find a user I want to manual credential procedure for we'll use John Dorian expand click view profile And then once this loads, we'll have a tab on this page for cases.
So if we click cases here, we will see a list of his current cases. And those that he's credentialed for, we could see there's a date, we could see there's a green check mark.
But for any of these other ones, if I. Choose as an administrator to mark him as credentialed. I can do so just by clicking the status.
It will then go green here, green arrow, and we'll display today's date. Now this is not something that should be done lightly, right, as this data can be used in actual patient related situations where someone is going to be notarized.
So only do this if you absolutely must and you have the proper paperwork to back up that yes, this person should be credentialed in this procedure.
One use case that you might have, actually use this for, is in a case where you have a transfer resident or a transfer trainee, where you do have the backing information that says yes, they are prevention to do this.
Procedure, here's who credentialed him, here's when, all that kind of stuff, but you just don't have that data in metrics, but you want to mark it off with their credential.
So if you have all that information backing up this decision, you can manually credential a user, and that is how you up, you can manually credential a user, if you did do this, and that is how you can manually by accident, just click the green arrow again and now they are no longer considered credentialed
in that procedural case.

Approving Case Logs and Procedure Logs as a Faculty Member 👍
Hi there. In this video we'll be discussing how faculty or otherwise a supervisor of a procedure log or a case log is able to approve that case log or procedure log.
So I'm currently logged in as a faculty member and I'm on my personal portal. So the personal portal is a faculty member.
Most users will spend their time in metrics. This basically applies to everyone that is not an administrator of some kind or has administrative rights over something.
They're only interested in their own kind of case logs or evaluations or other things that are linked directly to them or are about them in some way.
So we're talking about case logs here. And so when a user first logs in, they will see a list of about five or so of the latest case logs that they may still need to approve.
So this list can be empty and may not show up at all if they have completed all of those, but they will be front and center here so they could click on any of these to be taken to the case logs page.
They can also click the view all button here or just click on cases and then logs from the left nav.
All of them will take them ultimately to the same place. So let's go ahead and do that. And then from here, they will see a list of all of their currently pending case logs that they still need to approve.
And so there's a couple of methods they can use here. They can click on review, in which case they will see the case log and whatever information may be linked to it.
And then at the bottom here, they may or may not have the ability to select a level of performance. In some cases, you can hide this and they can only just approve.
And then in other cases, you can have them actually select this level of performance. So let's say in this case perform without any assistance.
And then any comments that they wish to share with the person who logged the case can go here. So I'll just type in something real quick.
And then they can choose to either approve or reject the case. If they approve the case. There's basically no other actions to be taken by them or the person who logged the case.
If they rejected the case, they will be able to see those comments or the user who submitted the case will be able to see the comments left by the faculty member and then can make whatever changes need to be made in order to get the case approved.
But we'll go ahead and approve that. So, if you have one case and that's if you're doing it on a one by one basis.
If a user has a lot of cases to approve and they know, hey, I don't really need to look at these as deeply as I might with some other cases.
There is also the ability to select and bulk. You could see here, so I could select. Multiple cases or I could select all the cases on the page if I wish.
And if I do that, I can then, in this case, I'm expected to set a performance level. So, it does show up in other cases.
It's just to approve or not. And I can mass approve these logs with that. Performance level. And so, this is just helpful if they have a lot of old cases.
They know nothing happened. That's really a merit. We don't have to look at it all that closely. And they can just approve the log.
And so, that is the basic methodology. There is also a method through emails. But if they click on the link in the email, it will, Basically take them to this page and they can perform the same kinds of actions.
So, no real differences. Just a little easier to access through the email. Because you don't have to remember your login info.

Creating Academic Periods 📚
Hi there, in this video we're going over creating academic periods. So, academic periods is a pretty simple concept, in many cases it represents either a full academic calendar year, it could represent semesters, things like that, that you're gonna link various other things in memory.
metrics to, just kind of like a big box that'll hold a lot of data and is used in various kinds of filtering and reports.
So academic periods will be used throughout the system, but to create them you must be on the institution portal, so we're already here.
So, once you are here, you'll want to go to System Setup and it's here. It's so special, it even has its own left nav here, Academic Periods.
And you can see in this example we are a GME, a Graduate Medical Education type organization, so I actually have full kind of academic years, so you can see that July 1st to June 30th the following year.
And so, Making new academic periods is very simple. Click on Add Academic Period. In this case let's say, well I might already have one for this next year, so let's do another one.
So let's do July 1st, 2025, and then this would be if I'm doing a full academic year, June 30th, 2026.
Click Save, right? And so since I just made that, I'm still able to delete it, but once data is linked back to an academic period, it will no longer be deletable, uh so you can make things like overlapping academic periods.
It is allowed, but however, in most cases, you do not want academic periods to overlap, and if you're a GME organization, uh, you just don't need that at all.
There are cases for when it can be useful, but uh GMB is not one of those. You'll just have your full academic year, and then once you've done this, it is usable by a program.
in your institution, so they can create block schedules and link you to that academic period, and then that'll be the block schedule for that year, uh, so, and you can make as many academic periods as you want, so if you want to make 20 academic years ahead of time, you are welcome to, uh, some clients
choose to kind of make the next one at a uh, kind of a later date at the end of the previous academic year, so people don't maybe get too ahead of themselves, uh, but it's up to you to decide that, so making academic periods quite simple under system setup and academic period.

Edit user demographics
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about editing user demographics. So demographics are pretty much what you'd expect, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and other various information about your user in metrics.
So to do so, you'll want to go to the user's page, page. And we can select any of our users here.
We'll use Cole Aarons for our example, expand their row here, then go to edit demographics. And so once you're here, you can start editing their demographics, and we're going to do that.
We're going to have a number of, um, default fields that you could see here. So, you know, on the simple side, first name, middle name, last name, title, credentials email, secondary email, all this kind of stuff.
We can also get into more unique identifiers like social security numbers, social insurance numbers, if they're a Canadian citizen, as well as what we call the employee trainee ID, which is just a unique ID that is given by your institution if you use something like that internally.
And we have the account activation date, the class of, which is when they're expected to graduate, if they're a trainee type of profile.
And these are your very basic demographics. If you want to store more information about each user and metrics you can, and you can access the other bits of information by going to the right nav here.
So we're in account info, which is all of our basics, right? Basically what you would need to make a user.
Then we have personal info where we have default fields for more things, birthday, birthplace, ethnicity, marital status addresses, and a big old notes field here called additional info where you could store anything else that might be helpful.
Then if we look at emergency info here, we can also capture that information and this will appear in various places throughout the system.
So you can add contact names, phone numbers, emails, and then their relationships. So spouse, brother, sister, sibling what have you.
And then at the end here we have additional info and we call it additional info because this is where you will find our custom demographic.
So basically, within metrics, and we'll have another video on this that you can look through in our knowledge base, you can make custom demographic fields.
So if you're tracking anything else that our default demographics don't capture, you can have them entered here. And as you can see, this is all custom stuff.
So you can have t-shirts size, large, medium. Medium, small, just a plain old text field. You can have a multiple select field where you can select multiple options with the options being customizable.
Select one where you can select one option from multiple custom options. So utilizing this page, you can go through and basically update whatever demographic you want, whether they are our default demographics that are available or they're available to you under additional info for any custom demographics
that your institution has set up. There is one other place you can just get to this page really quick. And you can have a swap between these pages.
So you'll see on the first page, the account info page, you can click here for going to Cole Aronson's profile.
And then if you go to edit profile here, it brings you back to the to the account info page.

View user profiles
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about viewing user profiles. So in earlier videos you may have seen us talking about creating users and editing those users' demographics.
Users' profile is a little different. It basically brings together a lot of different information about a user into a single place.
So to access user profiles you'll want to go to the users' page and then we can select we'll go with John Dorian here.
So we'll go to John Dorian, expand his user, and then we click on view profile here. And so, once their profile opens, what we're gonna see is basically all kinds of different information tied to this user and metrics brought into one place.
So you can see on this about tab, which is the default tab, I get a lot of demographic information, documents and certifications, emergency contacts, the custom fields that we've made in the system.
So this is really kind of like a one-stop shop for all of you are, you know, important to have that hand stuff.
So that's the about tab. We then have the education tab. In this case, we're looking at a resident. So this resident, we're going to have their entire education history going from undergrad to med school to the various GME programs that they've part of over time.
And then as well as post-training assignments so you can also keep track of you know, where they went after they graduated from your program if you're a GME program.
Attendance records for events, exam scores that they've received over time, evaluations from our evaluations module can also show up here and be reviewed.
Workout or violations and logs, cases and whether they're credentialed in those cases or not. Various documents and certifications that they may need to upload or you may need to upload on their behalf.
And then lastly, scholarly activity. So as you can see, it's pulling from multiple modules. In metrics and bringing it into one place for you so you can basically very easily peruse their data if you're just trying to look something up real quick.
All in the context of a single user.

Creating Custom Site Fields Tutorial
Hi there, in this video we're going over creating custom site fields for your sites. Uh, so custom site fields are helpful, basically it's more information that you can link to a site.
So we have our standard fields, but maybe you're tracking something else. So with this tool you'll be able to make.
Uh, those custom fields and attach those to sites and answer it, and then this will allow you to filter that later on.
Uh, so to make custom site fields, you'll want to be on the institution portal. Uh, you can access and filter custom site fields elsewhere too, but to actually make them.
You must be on the institution portal. So once you're here, you'll want to go to the left nav, system setup, custom fields.
This first tab is for custom user fields, basically the same concept, but for users, but we'll want to go to site fields.
So right now, you can see we have none, so let's make a few, so I'll just make a category, so you need to categorize these things, makes it easier to track, and also makes it show up a little nicer on the various views, you can add a description If you please, there we go, so here's a site category,
and then now, when we make new site fields, we have a couple different things we can do, uh, so we have our different types, so there's long text and short text, basically they're both text fields, that just depends how long it is and how it's shown, uh, then we have select one, which is basically a
drop-down that allows you to select a single, uh, response or answer, and then select multiple, which is kind of like a checklist.
So, sites can have multiple of these things, so let's, let's do something simple, let's call it like, uh, site type, right, and so that's going to be our field, we can add some description, and we're going to say that sites can only have a single type, and well, that's kind of confusing because we have
internal and external, so let's do, uh, something else, let's do, uh, site region, there's an interesting one, uh, so site region, select one, we're going to apply this to internal and external sites, so it'll be available to use in both, we have this field here for allow all.
all users to view this field, so basically if we don't check this box, this will be for administrative purposes, so we can see it as administrators, but users on the personal portal, if they're searching for something about a site, they will not be able to see or use this specific field, but in most
cases you probably want to turn that on. And then for options, we can do things like, you know, northeast, southwest, northwest, et cetera, right, and so these will act now as options, and these can be applied to sites.
So there we go. So we have regions, and so if I go to a site now, and I view the site, I can see here we have this category, so this is how it's organized, and we have our region, so if I go to edit the site profile, I can now select one of those options, so we can see I've set this site to have northeast
as its region, and so if I do filtering, I can say show me only the sites that are in the northeast, and now it will return that site.

Creation of custom user demographics
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how to create, or I guess you could say manage, custom user demo graphic fields.
So you may have seen in an earlier video already that if we go to the users page, if we open up one of our users and go to the edit demo Graphics page and then navigate to additional info, this additional info page will contain these custom user demographics.
So these are all things that can be defined by your institution. And basically these are things that we may not have in system as defaults, but you could make as many as you need to capture whatever information you might need.
And so those appear here. But in this video, we're going to go over how to actually make them. So user custom demographics are handled from the institution portal.
So if you're a program level admin, and you need some new custom demographic fields, you will want to contact your GME office or institutional coordinator or whoever to get these made.
So you can use them. But if you go to the institution tab here, assuming you have that permission, then go to system setup and custom fields, you will get to the page where you can create all of these custom fields.
So first step in creating custom fields is we usually recommend categorizing. Right. Unless you're just going to have the one category and maybe throw a couple fields in there.
Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but generally it's good to have a little bit of organization. So you can make a different categories here.
So I just have one called category. Add a category here and just, you know, new category. Pretty simple. You can also add a description if you want to be more precise with what you got there.
We've got our new category and now we can add custom fields under that category. So I'll just click add custom user field and then we've got a number of options.
So we'll just call this let's see, what are we going to do? We're going to do a. Text field, right?
So we're going to do a text field first custom type. And then with text fields, we have two options, long and short text.
So this doesn't really have a big impact on the data itself. It's more about how it's seen. So if you're doing long texts, you're trying to type in, you know, a bit of a paragraph, some kind of information.
If you're doing short text, that's good for, you know, something that's just going to be immediate, one word, a couple words, not a lot of information.
So let's make a short text field. And then we can define what kinds of users might need this field. So you might have different needs for faculty members or staff members, then you do residents or students.
Right? So let's say this is going to be a resident type custom field. And then you have this option here, allowing users to fill out their own answer for this field.
So this can have a number of applications depending on what you're using metrics for or what you're trying to capture here.
But if you turn that option on, users will have the ability to just fill it out themselves from their user profile.
Which can be pretty handy if you're just collecting little bits of information and you don't want to play, you know, email tag or anything like that with them.
You can just have them fill it out in the system, run some reports to make sure they did it. So that can be pretty handy.
In this case we're not going to turn them. So I've made my text field there and then we've got a couple of other types that are useful.
So select one. Basically, we're going to give the user a number of different options. And they're going to have to pick one.
So we'll just call this one a select one field. Again, we'll apply it to resident user type and then we'll add our options.
So our options under this field is going to be one, two, three, four. So they'll be able to pick one.
They're not able to pick any one of these options, but they can only pick one because we've got the select one custom field type. And then lastly here we have the select multiple.
So this basically acts like a checkbox. So if we need them to select multiple items under this field, this is the best thing to do.
And we'll do the same thing here. We'll select resident type and then we'll add, because I'm feeling very creative. Today one, two, three, four as our options.
All right, cool. And so now, now that we've done that, if I go back to the users page on my program portal.
Pull up John Dorian. He's a resident in our little program here. Go to Edit Demographics, Additional Info, and if I go to the bottom here, I've got my new category and I've got the different fields that I've created.

Understanding Excused Rotations 🔄
Hi there, in this video we're going over a very specific setting in rotations called excused So excused is a setting that you could turn on for a rotation that allows Anyone who's scheduled on that rotation for whatever time period during that time?
Period they will be by default excused from any calendar events that they are part of With the one caveat being you can set a calendar event to be mandatory for everyone Regardless of rotation, and then they will not be excused from that event.
But, to set this up, you'll want to be on the admin portal, go to schedules, and then rotations And so from here, let's say we have an example where if you're on clinic duty, right, let's say you're on the clinic rotation for whatever reason, that means you're going to be excused from calendar events
while you're on that rotation. So to set that up, select the clinic rotation here, go to edit, and then this is the setting right here, excuse this individual from conferences and other events.
So if I turn this on, for whatever time period a user is scheduled to this rotation, they will be considered excused from calendar events during that period.
So if that period is one week, four weeks, whatever it happens to be, with the exception of that mandatory setting that I showed earlier.
So this is useful for some cases, there are some rotations that you're just not expected to attend regular events on, perhaps they're doing an away rotation at a different site where they're not going to be able to come to your regular weekly events and so on.
So this is a very useful tool in those cases, so you can just set them to excuse. So that means that during that time period they're on the rotation, if you create an event, they will be excused from it, even if they're invited to it, most likely you're inviting people by their role, so say p2y1, 2,
and 3, so all users that meet that role are invited to the event, but those that are on excuse rotations will be considered excused, so that means, uh well, wrong tab, if we go to log attendance and we look at one of these events, we can see we have an option here for excused rotation, so the system
will automatically set that. uh, set that attendance record to excused rotation instead of absent, and if for whatever reason they do come by and actually attend, they can still be marked as attended and that be overwritten.

Reporting on user demographics
Hi there. In this video we're gonna talk about reporting on our user demographics, so that is going to include both our default demographics that are just part of metrics, as well as any other custom demographics that you might have made that you guys are collecting.
So So if we go to a reports. From our left nav and then we'll go to demographics across the top.
There are a couple of other options here, but we're looking for in this video is user information right so this is demographics about our users addresses emails contact information emergency contact their education history.
All kinds of different stuff and we can get it all and one report as long as we filter it the way that we want.
So going through the filters here, user statuses to include. So this is basically whether they're active in the system or not.
So if you include all active users, then that's probably going to include all of your current. Trainees, as well as current faculty, etc.
If you select them from the remaining filters, if you hit include all users, that's going to include all users, meaning historical users that are no longer active in the system will still be included in the report that we pull here.
Next, we select the program. So this is checking the user. This is the user's primary program affiliation. So on my account, I have access to many programs.
So I can select all or just one. Depending on the data I'm going to pull, I'm just going to select all here for simplicity.
Then I select the roles of the users I'm trying to pull and the important thing to note here is this is talking about their current role.
So with faculty, their roles probably don't change all that often, but with trainees, they probably will. You know, year over year, people will have different roles.
So this is going to use their current role to determine what, what users you pull here. So I'm just going to pick my feature I want.
One, two, and three residents here. Rotator programs is not in use by many programs. So we're just going to skip that.
Down here we're going to look at basically scheduling and training history criteria. So this is good if you are looking for people that came to your program during a very specific point in time.
So this is particularly handy if you have a lot of, like, visiting residents or visiting students and you don't know a lot about them.
But you do know that they rotated through your program between date X and date Y, right? So you can set these dates and it will check schedule information and training history information to try to identify the correct set of users.
Just to get a lot of information on the page here, we're going to leave this blank. And then below that we start to get our default fields and more custom fields.
So you can see profile information. This is like your, your basic default demographic field. So I can include all of those additional info here.
These are the custom demographic fields. So the, the answer is still whatever custom demographics we've made will appear here. So if you have documents and certifications, this is pretty handy. So if you have things like ACLS certifications or other kinds of documents that have expiration dates or perhaps
useful ID numbers attached to them, you can just pull that from this report here. The ID on the user's education tab in the profile can be pulled out of the IDEMF graphics report here.
Emergency info, so primary and secondary contact, contact information and relationships can be shown here. Undergrad medical education. So they're med school, citizenship status, pre-med school education and post-training assignments.
They're all available here. Now I'm gonna go ahead and select them all and run this report this way. Though I would say generally I wouldn't recommend doing this because depending on how many custom fields you have and how many different document types you're tracking, you could end up with a very big
file here. So generally I don't recommend doing this but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it for the sake of this video.
But usually I would have you ask the question to yourself of well what do I need here? And let me just pull that information so this way it's easier to keep on track with whatever you're doing.
And then when you pull the data out we'll just pull it up here in excel. And so pretty basic right?
You've got all the users so you got kind of default information here that's going to be included with all of these demographic reports regardless of what you select.
And then after that we started listing all of the lovely custom demographic default demographic documents and other kinds of information.
So you can see this is why I recommend you don't really run it for all as on our demo system here we have quite a few document types and custom demographics.
So it's probably going to include a lot more information than we need so I do recommend that you filter it down to exactly what you're looking for with that particular run unless you have a need to just kind of pull a lot of information out of the system all at once.

Emails/SSN/Employee must be unique and why
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk a little bit about the concept of a unique identifier and that really comes down to things like email addresses, social security numbers, and then employee numbers and metrics.
Basically, you can't have two users that have the same e-mail address, social security. Employee number or employee number and that's just good data management because if you have two people with the same number, something is wrong, right?
Something is incorrect because those should be unique to everybody. So there are basically tools in place that allow you to identify that and deal with it if you come across it.
So we're going to use the users page here to do a quick demonstration of this. So if we go to John Boring, we'll go to edit demographics, we're going to grab his social security number here so no worries.
Not a real social security number, or low I suppose. It's someone's social security number, I guess. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, who knows.
Ah, but anyway, if I try to make this number the social security number for another user in my program, so I just so happen to have it. I have wannabe here, and if I enter this social security number for this user and try to save, the system is going to stop me.
And it'll tell me, hey, John Dory and PJ Wyatt 2, whose primary program is internal medicine, has the same social security number.
So obviously this is telling me that, hey, I've done something incorrectly, two people can't have the same one. So I must have made an error in creating the original one or something along those lines, and I need to go fix it.
But this is an important concept throughout the system because things like email addresses, social security, etc., etc., etc. Social security numbers and employee numbers down here, this identification section on the Add a Demographics page, this is how we update data and how we make sure we send data
to the correct people. So something like an email, pretty obvious, right? We need to have the correct email on the system for the person so they get the communication from us.
But in cases where perhaps we're trying to mass update information about our users, we need to have a unique identifier so that we can match the correct user account in metrics.
And that's what this does. So for example, if I'm doing a import of demographic information to the system, I need to match on something so I update the correct user so I'll match on something like an email.
So I can change the email address or social security number or employee or trainee ID. And that allows me to make sure that when you upload a file or something to that effect in metrics and you want to update a bunch of data for a user that we find the correct user and update the correct one.
Because only this user will have this email address, social security number, or employee number. Thank you.

Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about inviting new users to log into Metrex. So an important thing to note is that when you first create a user in the system through the users page, that user will not be invited automatically to the system.
And the reason Reason for that is simple, often times when our clients are creating users in the platform they're probably setting up other things.
And so you don't want people logging in while the environment is not complete, right? You're probably looking to have their schedules already loaded.
You may be uploading some kind of resources that they'll need to access during the early part of their onboarding. So you don't necessarily want to invite people as soon as you create the account.
So in order to invite these users to the system quickly, we can go to the users page, invite tab, and from here we'll have a search capability and some filters that allow us to find the new users we've created and have it invited yet.
And then simply invite them to the system. So if I do a quick scroll here, you'll see I have a number of users that don't have the last logged in or invited tag already.
So these are the folks that still need invitations to the system. So I can simply go to the top of the page here, click select uninvited only, right, that will select all these users and then I have two options.
I can either invite them and send them an email and so that email will send well the email will contain a temporary log into the system and then when they actually log into the system they will be able to change their passwords, set their own, and do all that kind of stuff.
The other option here is mark as invited. So that's a unique workflow that is used by our clients that have single sign-on functions.
They can have functionality enabled within metrics meaning that their users will log into their own local internet effectively and then using that same login they can log into metrics because the two platforms are linked together.
So if that's what you're doing at your institution, the mark as invited button is encouraged because this way the user will not even know what to do. You can receive like a separate password or anything like that, they'll just be able to log in automatically with their credentials from your internet
. So both options are viable but we do recommend the mark as invited option if you are using the single sign on function just so users don't get confused about having multiple passwords because in that case, they don't need them.
They only need the password to their account on your intranet and the other thing to note here is that if you have users that you have previously invited but they haven't logged in like Carmen here, you can still select them and then invite and send an email which will just repeat the process
. It will send them another email with more temporary login information and they can use that to get into the system and then set their own passwords.

Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about creating user groups. So there's a couple of ways to do that in this system.
In this case, we're going to talk specifically about how to do it through the front end or through the interface.
There's another video you can find here that talks about doing it via an import specifically a CSV import. But we're going to talk about that.
The front end interface here. So in order to create groups of metrics, you will go to users, groups, and then you can see here a list of groups that already exist, right?
And so to create a new group, click on the new group button here. And we'll keep this simple. We'll call this group group one.
We can enter a description. There's an option here for users with site permissions will have only view access to this group.
So this is a very specific use case. Most likely you will not need to touch it, but if you do, you probably already know that you do.
This is if you have a very specific set of users that have very specific permission. So for the purpose of this video, we will ignore it.
And then we have group expiration. So basically, is this a permanent group that will always exist or is this a group tied to an academic period?
And the important distinction here is basically how important is your historical data versus how important is it to just keep kind of a clean thing.
We don't want a lot of the same groups existing in different time periods. So that's up to you to decide.
I would say generally for our medical school clients, there's a lot of use cases for linking into an academic period.
And if you're one of our graduate medical education clients there's probably a good reason to maybe just look at permanent because things don't operate the same way between the two.
So pick whatever is the best use case for your scenario. So we're going to say Hey, I'm going to actually make it tied to an academic period.
And then lastly, things we have here are group tags. So again, this is a little more specific. You can think of it as a way to actually group your groups together, different types of groups, but you don't necessarily need it.
And it's an optional field. So if I click save, we have created our group, group one. And we can see that this one is tied to this particular academic period.
Right? So if I were to go look at a different academic period, I don't see it. I see only permitting groups and also groups tied to that particular academic period.
But in order to see the group I just made, I need to be in this academic period here.

Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss adding users to user groups. So in a previous video on Knowledgebase we created the groups and now that we have a group created we can add users to it.
So to do so we'll go to users on the left nav here, we will go to the groups tab, and then here's the group that I made earlier in the previous video group 1.
So go ahead and just search for them and isolate them here. There we go. And so now if I want to add additional users to this group I can just click on it to expand and you'll see that this group already has four members, right?
So if I go ahead and hit the add members button, I will then be able to add other users that have an affiliation to my program from here.
I could do a role search. So let's say I'm not quite sure who to add, but I know they have a role of MSR.
One. And let's say it's John Smith, right? Just so happens to be John Smith. And so I just click the add button here and they will now be added to my group.
And that is how you add users groups and metrics.

Remove users from groups
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about removing users from groups. So in previous videos we have made groups, we've added users to the groups, and now we are removing users from those same groups.
So to do so, go to users on your left nav, go to the groups tab. We'll isolate the group we made earlier, so here is group one, we see that it has five members, and now there are two ways to remove people from groups.
And basically it's user preference here, but oftentimes I will recommend this method if you only have a few people in the group.
So if you look at this, we only have five members, and let's say I know I want to remove John Smith from the group.
So, not too much data to deal with, there's John Smith. Just hit the X button, and they are removed. So if you just look in and remove one or two people, that's a pretty easy way to do it.
Now, if the group is larger, you might find it more advantageous to actually click on the add members button, which will bring up this view here, which allows you to see basically all users including those.
Users that are added to your group, and then you're able to remove them from this interface. So this is particularly helpful because of the search functionality if you have very large groups, right?
But if you do not, then the other method is also pretty effective where you can just find and remove them from the group without needing to go into that pop-up menu.

Giving users a group role (Mentor feature)
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about giving users a group role, which often refers to giving them the mentor role in metrics and providing them that kind of permission.
So to do so, we will go to the users page. Go to the groups tab and we'll have our group that we made earlier, group one.
And so a really brief overview of the mentor role is that within a group, there are members of the group and then there are people that could be given an additional role within the group with a default role there being mentor.
And so let's say we have an example here of a group where we have one supervising physician, so we could consider this like say the faculty member, and then we have two trainees that are attached to this group.
So basically you can have a scenario here like mentor, mentees, right? And so if we give this person a group role within the group, this person being called the supervising physician, then they can receive access and permission to view evaluations that are about these two trainees or if you want to
say mentees, right? And so to give Cole that kind of access, we open the group up like we did earlier by clicking on it.
We go to manage group roles. We enable a group role for the program. So we have a few different ones available in this system.
But we'll go with mentor here. And now that that group role has been enabled, we can add any of the users to that group role.
In this case, it's going to be Cole. So when Cole logs in after I make this change, they will be able to view evaluations about, well, so happens to be another Cole and Carmen without having additional specific program administration permissions.
They would only have access to the evals from these two specific trainees. So this is a very handy thing to do.
For people in that position that do not need full administrative rights, but should be able to see evaluations about a very specific set of people, most likely a set of trainees.

Create user groups via CSV Import
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how to create user groups using our CSV import tool on that page.
So to get there, we're going to go to the groups page, which is under users on our left map, and we'll go to the groups tab.
And creating users via the transcript. This CSV import is not a whole lot different than creating a user against a group individually.
It's the same concept. We're going to make a group. We're going to have people to it, except we're going to do it in a spreadsheet instead of doing it in the interface.
And if you have a lot of groups to make or a lot of people to add to the group and you have that information coming from somewhere else, this can save you.
Loads of time. So this works a lot like other CSV imports in our system. There's an upload groups button in the top left, pull that, and then I get this button where I can download a template.
So this is going to teach me exactly what I need to do to make my groups. There we go. If Excel decides to open.
So a couple of different things going on here. Just like we make groups and metrics in the interface of the system, we do that here in a spreadsheet, but we've got a couple of other special things we can do.
So let's say I'm just going to make a group. I'm not going to be very creative. I'm just going to say the group name is group one.
We have an academic year here. So again, just like when creating groups in the interface, there's an option where you can select an academic year.
If it doesn't matter whether that group is tied to an academic year or we would consider it a permanent group, you can just leave this blank.
Then we go to group members. And so you identify people here by their email address, right? So let's say JB at metricslab.com is going to be a user in group one here.
And then there are optional things here for adding a group tag to the group, as well as identifying a site that this group belongs to.
These are optional, you do not need to do anything with those, if you're not using them you can skip them, otherwise you can enter the appropriate information.
But the most important bits are here, group name, academic here, let's make that a little smaller, and then group members.
So the important thing to think about here, Is making the group numbers efficiently. So if you're adding a couple of group members, you do have the option of adding multiple people in this row.
Whoops, I kind of undid my work there. So adding multiple people to this row, like so, semicolon separated. So basically, add an email, semicolon, add an email, semicolon, and I can repeat this as many times as I need to.
So this will work, it'll get uploaded in the system, but there's actually a better way to do this, because most like, likely if you're getting a list of people together, you're probably going to have that list of people in a spreadsheet already with their emails somewhere.
And so instead of adding them semicolon separated to the same row, what you can do is repeat the row, right?
And so if I do this and I just add people individually, and instead of typing you would probably just copy paste from whatever file you're already looking at, and so this will accomplish the same thing as if I, added all these users in the same row, semicolon separated.
So if I do this, it's not going to make multiple groups named group one. It's going to just use group one multiple times to add these users to it.
And so using this to create my group, groups and users can make the whole process a lot faster, especially if you have a lot of groups or a lot of different combinations of things that you're trying to do with those groups.
So this is a very quick way to do that. And then like with all these imports, make sure to clear that basically that All right.
Demo row, where we give you some information about how you might want to set this up. And so now that I do that, I can upload this file here to CSV file, user groups, submit, upload user group.
There's group one and it's got people in it. So that's all there is to using the CSV import for creating groups and adding users to those groups.
And that's all

Delete User Groups
Hi there. In this video, we're going to discuss deleting user groups. So in previous videos, we have made groups, added people to them, removed people from them.
But let's say, hey, oh, we just need to get rid of this group entirely. So we're going to delete them.
So in order to do that, you will go to Users on your left nav. Go to the Groups tab. And so here's our group that we made in our earlier videos, Group 1.
And so all we got to do here, check the box, go to Actions, and I have a couple options here.
I can't empty the group entirely which would just keep the group, but remove everyone from it. Or in this case, I want to delete the group, which I can also do.
So delete group. So I don't need to go through and delete users individually or in bulk from the group to do this.
I can just delete the group outright, which will delete the group outright, remove all members from the group, and then remove the group itself.
And there you go. No more group one. And that is how you delete users from user groups. Or actually, no, that's how you delete groups entirely.

Exporting user groups and group members
Hi there. In this video, we're going to go over exporting user groups and the group members in them. So, most often you'll probably be working with groups within the system, but sometimes it's good to be able to just pull that data out of the system quickly and you might use that for a number of different
purposes. Is maybe. Trying to make, say, a mailing list or something like that. So whatever the reason may be, the actual process is quite simple.
So you go to users on the left nav, go to the groups tab. Once you're here, you can see a number of groups.
So we've got our, say, cardiology faculty and staff and our CCC group. So I can just select them with the check boxes there, go to the actions button, and then I just click download.
And what that will do is that will pull an excel file here and it will show me the group, the group name, any description tied to it, whether it's a permanent group or it's attached to an academic period when it was created.
And then here we are, all the different users that are part of that group and their email address as well as employee number if they have one.
And then finally if they have any particular roles within that group, that will also show up here. So quite easy to pull this information out of the site.
In case you need to keep it somewhere else or import it into a different system.

Creating users in bulk using a csv import
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about creating users in bulk using our CSV import in metrics. And so to do this, you'll be under the users page.
And if you look closely in the top left corner, there's a button here that says import user. And usually if there is a CSV import option on the page, you'll find it in about this location on the page.
So if I click on this and this is also pretty standard with the different CSV imports that we have we got some instructions that might be helpful.
Here's the primary program value you should use. Here's the home institutions that are associated with your program. Here are the roles that are available for your program.
So if you use all this information when creating the import file then you should be good and it should work just fine.
You can also download a sample CSV so this will be very helpful. Basically this is the format you need to follow.
So let's go ahead and do that. I'll pull that down and so that's it. So that'll open like this. And so this is again very similar to all the different CSV formats that we will have.
So if you look at the different fields. First name, if the field is required, it'll be denoted with that little asterisk there, and under each of the fields we have information that might be helpful in entering this data.
So, you know, for things like first name and last name, that's not going to matter very much, of course. It's just going to be text, but when it comes to things like work, mobile, phone, you'll see that it requires you to use a format like so.
And you'll see that again with other things like dates or things like that. A couple things to note about this field.
You'll see that I have some other fields here that are included. Included. Including some, some weird ones like what is your shirt size?
Right? So these are custom fields. So something that we do at Metrix and is explained in other videos is we can make custom fields.
So if we don't have a demographic field that fits your needs, we can just make one. And they can be things like this, which is just a free text field.
Or they could be like this where this is a, like a select one field, like a multiple choice. And then you'll have various choices to choose from.
You know, this is a simple example. It's just numbers to pick from, but they might be other text. It's how the system will understand what data to create.
So keep an eye out these different sections, especially for custom fields, because we'll tell you in the file format what the different options are that you can enter in those fields.
The rest of this should be fairly self-explanatory. And you can always rely on the explanations if you need a little help in creating the information.
One thing to note is that you do not want to say, you know, oh, well, I'm not really using these fields.
Let me just delete them. Right. You do not want to do that because the system is going to do a check on the format.
And if you just delete column headings like that, it's going to fail that check and you'll have to add them back anyway.
So whatever you download from this download sample CSV option, even if you're not adding anything to that field. Don't worry about it.
Just leave it there. Leave it alone and upload the file as is. This way you won't run into any formatting errors when you upload it.
And so after that, you can just choose the file that you've created once you've added all the information of what you need.
Submit the file and what will happen at that point. Is the system will begin processing that behind the scenes. You'll get a message about that and then when it's completed, the system will email you.
And hopefully that email only contains one attachment of all the users that were successfully created. But if there are errors with the data that you uploaded, something that we couldn't match up, you will also get an errors file that will tell you, hey, this row did not work, this row of data, we couldn't
import it, and it will also try to give you a reason why. Obvious ones would be like, perhaps the formatting of the email address is off, we couldn't create the user because it's not a valid email.
Things things like that. So in general, that is how you want to utilize the user to import VSCS-V. Thank you.

Updating user demographics and custom fields via user import csv
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how you can update your user's demographic fields information as well as custom field information using the CSV import tool in Metrics.
So for this, we'll go to users on our left nav and then just like you can see used when you, well, if you watched the earlier video when we created a file to upload our users initially using this tool, we can use the same exact tool to then update those users information in bulk if we need to.
Now hopefully you can take care of most of that when you're uploading them. Sorry, you're just kidding. That information in advance and this way you don't need to do it twice, but you can use this feature to update this information to once it already exists.
So just like we did there, hit the import users with CSV button. Pull the CSV sample or even better if you still have the original user import file that you use to create users, you can just turn that right around, add more information and use that to upload.
So that's kind of what I have here. I just have a simple version of that that I've done. For my user John Dorian here.
So here's all the basic information that I've added. This is more or less what you need to create a user.
So that's really all I added. And the rest here is optional. One thing that you do want to do is if you're reusing this row that contains these kind of helpful tips about what kind of data needs to go in there, if you didn't delete the row outright, you want to make sure you clear all these fields.
Before you do an import, you don't want to accidentally add some stuff here that doesn't really need to go there so we'll clear contents on that.
So now that I'm all clear, I can add whatever info it is that I need to add. So for example, at the time I didn't enter their address info.
Well, let's say I know the city there in Philadelphia, just like my tricks, right? Let's say that so I can save this file, and now I can just import this.
So choose file. Submit file, and it's going to give me this message here that hey, you're going to do this.
It's going to do this in the background, same as the user import initially. So hit confirm import, and if all goes well, you'll get an email in a minute or two that gives you the results of that.
And since these users already exist, you're less likely to run into problems. It's just updating existing information, so it should be a fairly smooth process.

Deleting Affiliations
Hi there. In this video, we're going to discuss deleting affiliations, deleting program affiliations to be more specific. And that's not usually something that you would do unless the user was affiliated with your program purely by mistake, right?
Maybe someone picked the wrong user, affiliated the wrong person to your program. But typically we don't recommend doing this because it's going to basically get rid of a record that identifies that this user was part of your program at one time.
And if the users just moved on, but they were correctly affiliated with your program in the past, we recommend deactivating the user.
And you'll find another video in our Knowledge Base all about that kind of. In this case we're talking about deleting the affiliation because the user never should have been affiliated in the first place, it was a mistake, right?
And so to do that we'll go to the Users page, and we're going to find our user here, wannabe. Go to their Edit demographics page.
And so this is where it's going to be. So we can see we're in the internal medicine program at Metrix Medical Center right now.
This person's primary affiliation is School of Medicine, right? So it's not our program, but they have a secondary program affiliation.
To our program internal medicine, which is why they show up in our users page. But let's say that well, that's not actually correct.
They're not affiliated with our program in any capacity, really. So in order to delete this, you want to uncheck the box here under secondary affiliations and then hit save and close.
You're saved and continue. And so what that does is that deletes the affiliation. So that's why it's kind of done in a different way there.
We don't really recommend doing this often. And the only reason to really do it is because it never should have existed in the first place, but that is how you would go about it.
So now if I go look, and find wannabe, I can no longer find them because they have no affiliation with our program active or otherwise.
So you can see here, I have the affiliation status which would normally be only looking for active users. But if I search for inactive users, they also do not appear here because now they have no affiliation with our program at all because we deleted it.

Viewing Program Administrators for the program
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss viewing the users that have program administrator rights on your program. So if you're an institution where it's fairly small and maybe you're the only coordinator or only director of the program, this is probably not something you're going need to do very
often, but if you're working at a larger institution and perhaps a lot of different people are helping out with different programs, this gets more useful and just understanding who actually has access to perform these kind of different administrative functions.
So to check this out you want to go to the users page and right from the users page there's going to be a button here that says program administrators.
And so if you click this button you will get a list of all the users in metrics that have program administration rights over the current program that you are in.
Right, so I'm in internal medicine right now, these are all the users in the system that have access to. I have rights over the internal medicine program.
If I switch to a different program like say dermatology here, click the same button. I'm now going to get a different list because this is a list of people that have program admin rights over dermatology.
So this is just a really quick way to understand who actually has these rights. And if you notice someone that shouldn't have these rights, you can get them removed.
Or if you notice someone that should have rights but isn't on the list, then you probably want to contact someone to make sure.
That they do have the appropriate access.

Changing user Roles and its impacts
Hi there. In this video, we're talking about changing user roles and some of the impacts that it could have. So, well, there's a couple of different ways to change roles and metrics.
There is system setup and advancement, which is used for changing roles, kind of as you might expect. In advance, we know that this PTOI 2 trainees are going to be PTOI 3 starting July next year, so we can just set that up in advance.
So there's another video that talks all about that. So we're going to look at this from the users page perspective, and we're going to use Cole Aronson as our example here.
So I'm going to open Cole's profile here and go to edit demographics. This is where I can change his role.
And we do that here under this section. This section is locked down just for the sake of not doing anything accidentally.
So if you do want to change the user 's role, you have to hit this checkbox and confirm, and that will open this up for you to allow you to change things.
And so now, let's talk about some of the impacts that can happen if you change a user's role. And generally speaking, they should be pretty minimal.
As long as that role is changed, they're changing within the type. So the experience for a user that is going from an MS3 role to an MS4 role on their end is basically nothing.
Unless you have configured things very particularly where perhaps MS4 users do not get access to the same resources That MS3 users do.
Although that would be pretty atypical and the answer would be MS3 and MS4 users can have access because people will just be promoted to the next role afterward.
They used to have access, there's no harm in continuing to have access, right? Things like that. So generally when you are moving people between roles under the same user type, so like student, any of these student roles are basically going to function the same, the same can be set for resident.
Where you do get some differences is in a case where, let's say you're promoting someone from a trainee type role, so like student or resident, and you're giving them a role under faculty.
So in that case some things are going to change on their end. You know, an easy example would be case logs.
So they are now no longer creating case logs. Now they are approving case logs, so their interface is going to be different.
Same thing with work hours. As a trainee they might be logging work hours. As a faculty, no, they're not logging work hours, or at least typically they're not logging work hours.
I'll not say never. But those are the kinds of changes you can expect when switching someone between one of the trainee user types, so student and resident and all the roles that are under that, to a faculty or staff.
Staff is typically separate, but in terms of metrics it's not that different. It's more about what you've assigned to the roles.
And that's, that's the thing to remember here is there's a lot of things in metrics based on roles. So I use resources as an earlier example.
You can see I have, I have a folder here that I just called for pgy1 eyes only, right? So I might have this folder set up to only be available to people that are currently a pgy1 role for whatever reason.
So if I promote someone from pgy1 to pgy2, they're not going to have access to that folder anymore. Same kind of concept with evaluations in terms of who gets assigned what.
Let's see if I have a good example here here. So this is an evaluation where it's a cardiology rotation eval, but it's only for pgy1.
So, of course, if I move someone from pgy1 role to pgy2 role, this is not going to get assigned for them, even if they're on the same rotation that is on the rule for the evaluation form because they're not pgy1, they're pgy2 now.
So, in terms of the interface and using metrics, not a whole lot is going to change for them as they move between roles, with the exception of some things will change if they move from the trainee roles to the faculty roles.
But mostly the difference is going to involve all the setup that you've done in other areas of metrics. So things might be hidden from them that weren't previously, if you've set it up that way, things that apply to them before may no longer apply to them if you've set it up that way.
So those are the things to consider when you're changing a user's role, but generally speaking, it's good practice to give them the role that reflects reality.
So if they're an MS4, they should be an MS4 metrics. There's few cases where something like that would not be true.

Deactivating a program affiliation for a user
Hi there. In this video, we're going over how to deactivate a user's program affiliation to your program. And so the use case for something like this is let's say that you're in a institution with multiple programs.
Maybe you run a transitional year program and eventually that student will move on to either a another institution for their specialty or maybe within your same institution for another specialty, right?
Or various other scenarios where they were part of our program. They are no longer part of our program. People want to keep the record that they were here, right?
And so that's why we have things like a program affiliation that you can activate or deactivate. And so to do that, we'll go to the users page and we're going to use our friend Cole Aronson as our example here.
So all you got to do is click on their rope, go to deactivate program affiliation and you'll see. You'll get a couple of things to do here and this is basically a bit of housekeeping when you're deactivating a program affiliation.
So things like pending evaluations. So you can see Cole, he didn't really do these. He's got 133 of them still sitting as pending.
So he's probably not going to be back to our program. So it makes sense to likely cancel. And the same can be said for documents attached to his user account and whether he's included in groups.
So a little note about groups. When you create groups you have the ability to link them to an academic period or an academic year depending on your nomenclature.
And if you do that you probably don't. You don't need to remove them from the groups and can keep them in the groups because that's basically a historical record.
But if you reuse the same groups year over year then it probably makes sense to remove users from groups when you deactivate them just to keep those things clean.
So keep that in mind. Then we have another option here. Updating their role. So oftentimes when you're updating or deactivating a program affiliation it's oftentimes a trainee that has graduated, right?
They're no longer with the program so this is also a good opportunity to update their role. Something like alumni, in this case alumni medical student.
But in other cases something else, right? So it's a good opportunity to just kind of do two birds of one stone here and then at the bottom you can also use this opportunity to document where they're going which could be useful reporting down the line and it's something we can pull right out of the system
for you. So basically, hey, we know that graduated. Then they went on to this other position or they further their trading.
They further specialize something like that. And so all of that can be captured here. So we can add all that information, click save and then it would deactivate the user's program for later.
I actually want to keep Cole Aronson because I use him for all of these videos. So in this case I'm just going to deactivate someone else like wannabe here.
No one likes wannabe, he's a wannabe. So, same idea here, he's got a couple of emails, let's go ahead and cancel them.
We'll change their role to alumni, or, yeah, he's a medical student so we'll stick with alumni, medical student, and then we can fill in this information here.
So let's say Bye! He's been starting fellowship at an external institution, why not? And just some information here, we don't really have real information but you can imagine it might be helpful to know these things, and then at the end we click save, he's been deactivated, and if we refresh the
page, and this is the payoff, right, we're not going to see them anymore show up in our usual reporting and searches and stuff like that because they're currently inactive, and we have this affiliated.
We have this program affiliation status active by default filter on the page and in many places metrics because you usually don't have to deal with the historical information all that often, but if you want to bring them back or reactivate their program affiliation, go ahead and just take this filter
off, search for wannabe, there he is. And we can reactivate this program affiliation and now we're back to where we were and we can do it again if we need to, right?
Sometimes people come back and yeah, that's how you deal with program affiliations in metrics.

Advancement of trainees through advancement function
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about using the advancement function in metrics to change the roles of our various users in bulk, probably at the start of an academic year.
So what this means is, at the beginning of an academic year or an academic period, you probably have a bunch of students or trainees that are advancing, right?
They're going from a first year medical student to a second year medical student, first year resident to a second year resident.
And there are various roles that you'll have in metrics that represent that advancement. So there's two ways to change roles, right?
You can go to each user, you can edit the demographics. I can change their role here, but that's going to take a while, especially if I have a big program, right?
So we don't want to do that. So what we want to do is we want to go under system setup and then advancement.
And so what this allows us to do is it allows us to take that action, but in bulk, right? So likely I'm going to have let's, let's actually do an example.
So let's do a filter here. So let's say I have a number of PGY1 residents here, right? So here's my list of PGY1 residents on the advancement page.
So I filter. For them using this role filter here. So now I'm only dealing with PGY1 residents. And of course, this means their current role.
So their role right now. So at the start of the next academic year, they are most likely going to be PGY2 residents.
So what I could do is I could go to each of these users and I could click and I could pick their next role, PGY2, and I can set the date that that role becomes active.
But even better than that, I can select all of the users that want. Hit select advancement and then here I have the option to either move them all to PGY2 right now or I can select a featured date where this will occur.
So what this means is that most likely you're on a pretty regular schedule and this advancement will happen probably around the same time every year.
So if we're talking a residency type schedule they will probably advance to their next role on July 1st the following year.
Click save on this, right? You'll see that the system has saved an entry here with our next role as PGY2 and that next role will occur on July 1st 2024 here.
And so at this point I am done. Anything else? And on July 1st and early in the morning on July 1st 2024, the system will take care of this and will change all of these PGY1 users to PGY2 users without me having to do anything else.
As you can see as I'm recording in September here, this is many months away, so you are more than happy. Welcome to set this up ahead of time.
And if something changes, then you can just make changes, but this way if you just take care of this pretty much right after the start of the next academic year, then you'll know you're good for the following one, right?
It can just be part of your normal activities and setting up a new academic year.

Deleting a User account
Hi there. In this video, we're going to discuss deleting a user account and how to do that. So typically we do not recommend deleting a user account unless the user really just exists and they haven't really done anything in metrics, they haven't been scheduled to anything, they just haven't been
used for anything. So in those cases, yes. And if they're not going to be used in the future, you might as well delete the account.
But more often than not, we recommend deactivating a account because that way any data that is linked to that account will be preserved and basically you don't have to worry about losing data and they'll still be out of your way.
But if you do run into a scenario where, well, hey, we made this user account. But they never really did anything and we're not going to do anything with them.
So why are they here? So that's a good use case for actually deleting an account. And so to do that, we can go to the users page and I've happened to make a user for this spectacular occasion.
It's delete me. So that's exactly what we're going to do. We're just going to click on the user here, click the delete account button.
So I'm just going to get a little confirmation here and to confirm, I will type the word delete and then there he goes.
The account is gone. But there's one other thing I want to show you here. And so if you attempt to delete an account, that contains something that we would consider to be let's say protected data.
So that's something like the user has completed evaluations, evaluations have been completed on them, they have schedules in the system, something like that.
If you attempt to delete a user that has something like that, so for example, Cole Aronson here, he would be one such user.
Oh no, I can't do that. So, if there's someone you want to get rid of, but there's information tied to their account that should be preserved, that's a good use case for actually just deactivating them using this deactivate program affiliation button instead of deleting them.
And you can find information on our knowledge base here about deactivating program affiliations.

Why can't I delete a user account?
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about deleting a user and why the system actually may not let you do that.
So if you watch our other video on deleting a user account, you'll see all the reasons why it may not be a good idea and should really only be done if the user was made mistakenly or maybe they were made and then really no actions were taken.
But we'll just do a quick recap here. For example, I have my user Cole Aronson. They're going to have a bunch of data in the system.
So if I attempt to do a delete here, it's going to stop me. It's going to tell me there's important data linked to this user.
So when it says that, Yeah. That means if I go view Cole Aronson's profile, it's mostly talking about three things.
It's talking about their schedules, which Cole Aronson as a student, you can see them clearly here. So you can see Cole has a lot of schedules over time here.
And so we don't want to lose this information because it could be useful for a variety of reporting. So we won't let you delete the account outright.
The other thing that's important are evaluations. So evaluations of the student are another piece of protected data that will prevent you from actually deleting the user.
And then finally, lastly, another thing are documents. So if the user has any documents attached to them, this will also prevent deletion of the user.
And so it's important to keep this information preserved. So that is why we do not allow you to delete the user if they have these things.
If for some reason they have these things and you still want to delete them, maybe it's just, it's just not useful data to you anymore for whatever reason, then you will have to go through and delete each of these things, each of the schedules, documents, and evaluations.
And if you do so, you will then be able to delete the user. But honestly at that point you're probably better off just deactivating them anyway.
They'll stay out of your way much like they would if they were deleted and you don't have to spend the time deleting them and deleting all these different items you might have to delete.
So you're usually better off just deactivating the user account.

Creating Sites in Medtrics
Hi there, in this video we're going over creating sites in Metrix. So first things first, to be able to create a site, you must be in the institution portal.
There is an opportunity to view sites and their information from other portals, but to create them, you must be in the institution portal.
Once you're here, you'll go to Sites on the left nav, and you'll see we already got a couple in here.
So, what exactly is a site? Uh, most simply, it's a location, right? Uh, so there could be different ways that you set up sites based on your particular use cases.
Bye. But in almost every implementation of Metrix, you will need at least one site, uh usually at least to represent your actual institution.
So you can see here, we have that. We have the MetrixLab site. So, to create new sites, you will go to Create Site, and the first thing you need to do is pick whether the site should be internal or external.
So we'll pick an internal site here. And so once we've done that, we name it. So let's say we're gonna have an additional, additional Metrix site.
If you've watched these video series, you'll know I'm very creative with my names. And then after that, uh basically put in the information.
So if you have address information about that site, you could add it here. As well as contact information for whoever should be contacted if there's some, some issue with the site or you need to get a hold of someone.
This is a good place to put it. And then we have your employer. So this is one of the more unique aspects of creating a site.
Employers are really only necessary to set up if you are using our iris module for reporting to CMS. In that case, these are basically like the business entities that the site is reporting under.
So there might be, you know, we might have an entity called Metrics Lab. That's the entity that submits the reports to CMS.
But whatever happens at this site, whoever's scheduled to come through here, that counts under this employer. So yeah. You might have a setup where each site has its own employer, you might have a setup where all your sites are linked to the same employer, and anywhere in between, or if you're not using
IRIS, you won't care about this at all. And then lastly here, we have your code. So this is optional, it's just a unique identifier, you don't need to have one, but it can be very helpful if you're say, integrating metrics with other platforms, other kinds of databases, uh it's just very helpful to have
a single unique ID that you can use throughout those databases and platforms. So if you don't have one, it's also never too late to start, it's helpful to have one, so even if it's as simple as one, it's still something, and so we've created the site, uh so that was additional metrics site up here, and
now I could click on this to view information about the site, or I could click on edit to change anything about what we just did.

Creating Exam Types 📝
Hi there. In this video we're going over creating exam types. So exam types are what you link exam scores to in metrics.
So you can add exam scores to various users to keep track of how they're performed on exams. In order to create that exam score you need a type to link it to.
So to create exam types you need to be on the institution portal. So you could see exam scores elsewhere throughout the different portals and views, but to actually make the exam types that those scores will be linked to you need to be in the institution portal.
So once you're there you'll go to system setup and then custom. And so we'll see we'll have a couple of things up here and what you're looking for is exam types.
Click on that you can see we already have a few in here And it's very likely that when you even first log into the system there will probably be a few by default here things like comlex and USMLE that are pretty standard.
For many organizations as well as things like in training exams likely already to be here But you can always make new ones for your own purposes So if you click on new exam type very simple you just create the new exam type whatever it is you want want to name it and then you select the programs that
it applies to so what that does is if I am a coordinator or some kind of manager for one of these programs I will be able to use the exam type for my users however if it's not applied to my program then it won't be shown to me so this is good in cases there's something very specific to a program and
you don't want to clutter it up for other programs, right? So things like USMLE and COMLEX, those are going to be standard pretty much throughout the organization but some programs might do things a little differently for specific things for the way they handle in training exams or what-have-you Maybe
you don't want that data combined with other programs for whatever reason. And so that's why you can just select the number of programs that you want it to apply to here and click save.
And that's all there is to it. And once you've done that, now when you go enter exam scores for users, for example if I go to USMLE users here, I'll pick up one of my usual guys, so John Dorian, go to view their profile, and then there's going to be a tab here for exam scores.
So there it is, exams. And so now here, I'll be able to add exam scores using the type I just created represented here under the exam column.

Creating Custom Event Types in Metrix 📅
Hi there. In this video, we're going over creating event types, and so those event types will be used in conjunction with the calendar module in Metrix, so when we create a new calendar event, we have this thing here for event type, and that's just a good way to categorize things when you're running
reports, it'll be easier to consolidate, and so on. Metrix will come preloaded with a number of event types, things like conference, lecture, meeting, things like that, standard stuff, but different organizations have different needs when it comes to that, especially if you have any specific reporting
that you might do. So, what you can do is create custom ones on the institution portal, so event types can be used on the institution and admin portals, and well actually even the personal portal, if you have permissions over the calendar, but to actually make them you must be in the institution portal
, so once you are in here on the institution portal, uh go to the left nav, system setup, and then we're going to be under customize, and then click here on event types, uh so unlike other things in the system that might be more specific to like uh programs, these are just made generically, so event
types, if you make it here, it's available for all of your programs to use for whatever purposes they, they wish.
Uh, so creating a new one is very easy, click on new event type, and really all you gotta do is give it a name.
So this is a uh new conference event. You know, whatever that means. Uh, click save, and that's it. And so once you have done that, uh, you can see that you are able to delete event types that have gone unused, uh, so that could be a useful thing there, if you have a number of these that you created
over time, but don't actually need them. Uh, that's a quick way to identify that. If you can delete it, it means it's never been used.
Uh, you can also deactivate them if they have been used, but you don't actually want to continue using them. Uh, but once I've done this, I can now go to the calendar and click on event, and here it is, new conference event.
So with that, I can, I can do whatever I wish with these and use it to filter in various reports.
So, good way to get things more customized for your organization.

Changing who can view resource folders and their contents
Hi there. In this video, we're going over changing who can view resource folders and their content. So in order to do so, we're going to go to resources on our left nav here.
This will take us to our set of folders for this program. And if we click on the edit icon on any of these folders, for example, handbooks here, we'll have this section that says share contents of the resource folder.
So these are effectively the permissions of who can view this folder. So these people will need to be associated with your program, either through a primary affiliation or a secondary affiliation, and then must meet your needs. Either they match one of the selected roles, or they are part of one of
the selected groups that get access to this particular resource folder. And all you need to do to change that would be to hit these checkboxes right here.
So if we decide that for whatever reason, administrator administrators no longer need to have access to this folder, you can just turn that off, click save, and then viewing rights will be removed from administrators in your program from viewing that folder.
If we want to add it back, of course, same process, add them back, click save. And there we go. That is how we handle permissions of who can and cannot see various items in our resources module.

Sending notifications about new resources
Hi there. In this video, we'll be going over how to send notifications about new resource items being created in your resources section.
So, we go to Resources on the web tab, and then we'll take a look at one of these folders that you've created.
Let's say we can put folder. Go to Edit here. At the bottom of the handbooks folder, you can select who should be notified.
So, this means that when new items are created in this folder, either by you, other program administrators, or users that are given rights over the specific folder to create new items, these selected people can be notified that that new item was added, and they can be notified via email, basically right
after the item was added. So, in order to do so, you can just select the users here, whoever it may be, that should have notifications about new items in the folder.
Check this box, and this will enable the system to send emails out to those users when new items are added to that resource folder.
So, the one note here is that you probably only want to turn this on once, ah, let's say that resource folder is kind of finished, you know, these are the items that are going to be added. It's going to be in here, same items are going to be here in a while, then you might want to turn that on so as
you're building out the folder and adding all that stuff to it, ah, you probably don't want to have that on as people might get spammed by the system as you consistently add new items.
So, once you've kind of set your baseline, that is a good time to then enable this and allow people to get notifications about any new items added.
So, that's what I'm excited about.

Setting administrators for specific resource folders
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about setting administrators for specific resource folders. So what this means is under the resources module that we'll go here under the web map, the resources.
So for each of these folders we can set specific users within our program and allow them to actually have edit rights over that particular folder.
So this is particularly useful if you have say, like, chief residents that are in charge of keeping certain items up to date, adding new stuff as it comes in to resource folders or perhaps you just have some folks that are helping you out with this that do not necessarily need full admin rights
over the programs but they can help out with this specific piece. And so in order to do that let's use our handbooks folder as an example.
We'll go to the edit button here and then right here where it says admin users I can select any of the different users that are available in my program and I can give them specific rights over this resource folder.
And this is per folder as well so if they should have rights over two of the folders but not the other ones then you can handle that here.
And what this will do is on the personal portal when they go to their resources section in much the same way that other users might view, go to just view the resources they will be able to actually take all the same actions that you would as an administrator of the program but only for that specific
folder that they've been given admin rights over.

Sharing link to a specific resource file
Hi there. In this video, we're going over sharing links to specific resource files, and so you're going to find this under the resources section.
We'll go to handbooks here and we'll pick one of the files, let's say the attendance policy. If we look at the attendance policy, we'll see we have this little right arrow kind of button, and if we click on that, we will get this link to share.
So what this is, is basically a direct link to this. This is a particular file that can be shared basically wherever we want to put it.
We could send it out with an announcement in metrics. We can put it in an email and send it to people.
We could place it somewhere else, put it on a spreadsheet for other people. It doesn't really matter. It's basically up to your imagination.
But if we copy this link and then wherever we paste this, we will be able to share this file with people.
So you can use that in a variety of ways. As I mentioned, one thing that we see often is within the announcement section, we'll actually just post the URL, and this will allow people to download a particular file if they wish directly from the announcement itself and metrics.
Or if you need to distribute this through some other means, send it to people that don't even have necessarily a account with metrics.
That will also work and anyone can download it.

Sending a link via email to a specific resource file
Hi there. In this video, we're going over sending a link via email to a specific resource file. So to do this, we'll go to resources on our left map here.
Let's pick one of the resources in our program. So we'll go to the handbooks folder and let's say I want to share my attendance policy with someone specifically.
So of course, you can always direct them to the appropriate place and metrics to go look at that policy, but some folks need a little more direction and it's a little easier just to send them the thing, right?
So if we go to the attendance policy and click this button here with the logo, right arrow, this will bring up this section.
So in another video, we talked about this link, which you can copy, put an email or whatever, and you can share that, but you can also send it to specific people or people that match certain roles or groups directly in metrics.
So you don't have to go into your email, select who whatever it is you're trying to send it to, and then send it to them.
You can actually just do that through metrics. So let's just say I want to tell all my PGY1 users that hey, you gotta look at this, right?
Take a look at this resource item. So what I can do is I can just select that, click send invitation, and that will send them an email to go look at that resource item directly.
So you could have done that as well by copying the link, putting in an email, and then sending it out, but you might as well just have metrics do it for you.

Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss moving resources around between your resources folders. So if we go to resources on our left map, let's go to the handbooks folder and let's Oops.
I didn't. Actually mean to put the attendance policy in the handbooks folder, right? I actually meant to put it somewhere else.
So if we want to move it, all we have to do is click this little blue right arrow here. And this will open up a little interface that allows select the various other folders that exists within our program.
And so let's say I didn't actually Thank you. I wanted in the handbooks folder. I wanted it in the for PGY one eyes only folder.
So go ahead and select that click save. It's going to ask me to confirm that I guess I actually do want to move this resource.
As you can see, it has now disappeared from the handbooks. Resource folder. And if we go to for PGY one eyes only, we see that the tent policy has now been moved here.

Block schedules organized by academic year
Hi there, in this video we're going to be talking about block schedules and specifically how they are organized under academic years or for some folks academic periods.
So I'm here on the dashboard but we're going to go to schedules and the default tab here will just be block schedules.
So this is where we want to be. What we want to focus on here is how each of these block schedules are always going to be tied to what we call here an academic period.
For some people this is going to be like a full year, for others this might be like quarterly or semesters or something like that.
But ultimately the date ranges don't matter it's just that it is linked to a period. So you'll see by default I'm always going to be looking at whatever the current day falls into in terms of academic periods.
So that's why it is defaulted to this. So if you see that perhaps you're seeing new schedules today versus what you saw yesterday, chances are the academic period that's being defaulted has changed.
But we can always go back and find older schedules. And you can do that by clicking on the academic period dropdown and selecting an older academic period.
And you'll see the page will refresh and pull in whatever block schedules were linked to that period. Switch back. And I'm back to where I was.
And as far as moving the academic period, I'm going to go back to the academic period. These things around. If, for example, you've already created a number of future academic periods and you linked your current block schedule for the wrong one, you can fix that pretty easily by editing the block schedule
and just changing this reference to academic year here. So select the proper one and save and that will have it under the correct.
Ah, blocks, ah, academic period. And so that's all we have on this video. Thanks for watching.

Organizing Shift Schedules by Academic Year 📅
Hi there. In this video we're going to be talking about shift schedules and specifically how they are organized by academic year or academic period.
So we're on the administrative portal here. We're going to go to schedules on the left nav. And then this is very similar to block schedules.
We've seen our previous video about that where each of them are organized under that academic year or academic period. This is basically done exactly the same way with shift schedules.
The only difference being that with shift schedules some of our clients choose to move these forward over time instead of recreating them each year.
And that works pretty well with shift schedules as opposed to block schedules. So if we go under the shift schedules tab you will see that currently under this new and current academic period I do not have any shift schedules available.
But if I go back one academic year or academic period I will see that. I will then have my clinic schedule from last year shown here.
And as I mentioned some of our clients choose not to recreate these every year. Sometimes the shifts basically stay the same year to year so there's no real good reason to not just reuse them.
And in those cases they can click on edit. And then there's an academic year field on the shift schedule so quickly just change that to the year you desire.
So in this case we're just going to move this to the current and new academic year. Scroll down to the bottom and click save.
You'll now notice there is no more shift schedules in the past academic year but if we go to the newest one we now have that same clinic schedule.

How to Create a Shift Schedule 📅
Hi there, in this video we'll be going over how to create a shift schedule. So do so from your admin portal, go to schedules on the left nav, then go to the shift schedule and go to the schedules tab, and you'll see that I already have one here for this academic period, but I'll go ahead and make a new
one. So I'll click on new shift schedule in the top right corner. So we'll give it a name, we'll just call this one continuity click.
We assign it to an academic period, so in this case we'll say it's for the current period, so I'll just pick that.
Then we can select who is going to be shown on it, and also who is going to be schedulable using this shift schedule, so that's important to get right.
So we're going to, select all users that have the roles p2, y1, 2, or 3. In addition to that, we have the option of selecting groups, so the same way that users that match this specific role are schedulable on the schedulable, you could do the same thing with groups.
So any. Users that are part of these selected groups can also be scheduled on the shift schedule, so we won't use that here.
We're not really set up for it, but you can use that in cases if you need to be more specific than hey, the user has this role.
You could say it's users that are part of this group and you can make any group you wish basically. Admin users, so any user that you select here, so let's say Perry Cox, for instance, will have admin rights over this specific shift schedule.
So this is good for chief residents or anyone else that might need edit access over this specific schedule, but they don't need to have full admin rights over the entire program.
We have the site value here, and this comes into play a lot for iris reimbursement. If you're not using metrics for iris reimbursement, honestly, it does not matter all that much what you put here, but it's still good to pick the right site just to make sure people don't get confused and go to
the wrong place. So we'll say this is for metrics hospital north, and at the bottom here view only access. So anyone that is scheduled to a shift schedule will be able to see their shifts on their calendar automatically, right?
Because it's their calendar. But what we could do here is we can allow other people that are part of the program.
To be able to view this whole shift schedule just on their personal portals, if that is useful. So this way if they got to see, oh, who's doing this shift today?
I'm not sure. They could go look it up without having to contact someone to get in touch and figure it out.
So oftentimes, unless there's any reason to not share it, we do recommend sharing this information with people that are in your program.
So you can grant that view access through their role, or if only very specific people need to be able to view this, you can also pick them as individuals.
And those are all the different elements to doing this. So if you click save, that will create your shift schedule.

Understanding User Criteria and Custom Groups on Shift Schedules 👥
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss who is shown and who is schedulable on a shift schedule. So to look at that we'll go on the left nav or admin portal.
We'll click on schedules. Then we'll go to the shift schedules tab and long story short it's basically going to be users that match these criteria here.
So you can see both of these shift schedules have the criteria of users that have the role of pgy1, pgy2, or pgy3.
And so that is if you are using roles in the system. If we click on edit next to any of these, this is the section where you can change this.
So if you'd like to add or remove certain people as being part of these schedules or being possible to add to these schedules, you can turn these on or off to do a by role.
You also have the ability to do it by group. So in case role is a little too broad and you want to be more specific with who gets shown on these schedules, you can always put people into whatever custom groups you like and then attach them to the shift schedule.
So let's just say it doesn't really make sense, but we'll do the cardiology faculty and staff, click save. And now if we look at the shift schedule, it's any user that has the role p2p1, p2p2, or p2p3, or has a few h.
With this group that is cardiology faculty and staff. So if either of those things are true, the user will show up and be able to be scheduled on the shift schedule.
But this is not an and statements. So they don't need to be a p2p1 user. That is also part. Of the cardiology faculty and staff group, they can be one or the other.

Who Can See Content Within a Shift Schedule? 🤔
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about who can actually see content within a shift schedule and a bit of a spoiler alert.
It's pretty much whoever you want to. So we're going to talk about who can actually see content within a shift schedule and a bit of a spoiler alert.
So we'll go to schedules on the left nav. We'll go to shift schedules. And so by default, if you don't use any of the different permissions that we're about to talk about, these shift schedules in their totality will be limited only for you.
Over here are the sections of the events numbered on YouTube which areirk that you can actually compare to updates looked at.
And so that's with the kind of information schedules. And if we look down here, we have admin users. So this is for viewing rights, but it's also for edit rights.
So if we want to grant, grant edit rights to a user without giving them edit rights over the whole program or like full administrative rights, we can add them here.
And then they will be able to view and edit whatever is on the shift schedule. Otherwise, we have this view only access at the bottom here.
And so users that match these roles that have some affiliation with your program, we'll be able to see the entire shift schedule from their personal portal.
And you can also do this by individual. So if you don't want to give it to everyone that's part of the program or people that match certain roles, but really just very specific people, you can use this by individual section, this field to do that.
And if we go to my personal portal here. And as this user, because we have made that schedule available for pretty much everyone in the program to see, when I click on schedules on my left nav, I get to see here's a block schedule that has also been made available to be in a similar way.
And then also the shift schedules, I will be able to view this. In this case, I'm also an admin of these schedules.
So I get the little tag here that lets me know that. But basically, if I'm not an admin, it's the same that tag isn't there.
I just don't have the ability to edit the thing, right? And so if we go back to the admin portal, there's one other way.
You can grant view rights over these schedules. And this one is a little more unique. If you go to schedules, shift schedules, and then click this get public link button, this will grant you a URL here that you can.
And basically paste into anywhere and without needing to log into the system, you will be able to view the content within a shift schedule.
And so that is particularly useful if you have, say, like, nursing staff or other folks that are around you know, the clinical practice of whatever kind it might be.
But maybe they don't have metrics. The counts are not really involved with the program in that way. But they still might need to see that, that information, that shift schedule.
So it's good to distribute that link to folks that might need that kind of access. So you can always get that from the get public link button here.

Creating Shift Templates for a Shift Schedule 📅
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss how to create shift templates as part of a shift schedule. So the shift templates are really the actual shifts within a shift schedule, and so this will start to make sense in a moment.
If we go to schedules on the left nav, then we go to the shift schedules. And in this tab we'll use this continuity clinic schedule to take a look.
So at this point it's pretty bare. I have not made any shifts, so you'll see I just see basically a blank calendar on here.
And so now what I could do is I could go to manage shift templates and I can actually put in a shift.
So if I go here, so this is a continuity clinic schedule. So you might have like an AM and PM shift, a morning and afternoon shift here.
So let's kind of run that scenario. So continuity clinic AM and we'll say the AM schedule. Let's say that's a 8 AM.
To noon kind of deal. Right? There we go. So 8 AM to noon. And we get to select how long this shift runs.
So if you have a shift that never changes, it's available every day. There's always a continuity clinic shift in the morning, something like that.
But you can pretty much let this run as long as you want. But if things are maybe a little more fluid than that, we usually don't recommend selecting like more than about a year here.
So we'll go ahead and go through the whole academic year here. So for the academic year, we're going to make the continuity plan a.m.
Shift from 8 a.m. To 12 p.m. And then we have our repeat and weekly pattern functions here. So the most common scenario you have here is basically every day of the.
Normal work week. The shift is available. There's always going to be someone on continuity like in the morning or something like that.
Right. You can also include Saturday and Sunday if need be. And so if I create this, I will have on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
Friday from July 1st to June 30th of next year, a continuity clinic a.m. Shift to utilize. And I can also grant it some kind of color.
Let's just make it red. So it'll pop on my dark background here. And if I want to add any specific notes that people can.
See when they're scheduled to the shift, I could put those here directions, contact information of certain important people that are part of the shift or something like that is always helpful.
So it'd go ahead and click save. And now I have created. I shifts and now I have a morning continuity clinic shift available.
For me to use throughout the academic year. And of course, I could basically repeat the same thing and do it with an afternoon shift, right?
So I also have to spell right continuity. And let's say that's a one PM. To 5pm type of shift. We'll do the same dates here.
To 30. But let's say just for the sake of doing something different. Let's repeat a different pattern. So let's say that in this case, instead of it just repeating every day of the week, the afternoon clinic in fact repeats every two weeks.
And it's the first Monday and second Wednesday and second fr- Friday. And this will repeat every two weeks over the given time period.
And let's make that yellow. So you can get a little more creative if you have a very specific way that the shifts are done.
The other option is just to always basically make it available at any time. And so this way- even if people aren't scheduled to it, it'll be there.
And in case something changes, you'll have the option to just put someone on the shift. But if it's really strict and you know exactly how it's going to be, you can use this to do this.
And this can also be more helpful if you're using our automation tools that will- we'll discuss in a later video where that might fit better with a weekly pattern like this.
So we can get into that later on, but we'll go ahead and click save. And you'll see what happens here is that the pattern is repeated, but differently, right?
Now it's a two week- pattern instead of an every week pattern. So first week is here and second week is here.
So first week, Monday, second week Wednesday, Friday. And it'll repeat that pattern throughout the period instead of just being available every day.
And so that is how you make shift templates and metrics.

Adding Users to Individual Shifts on a Shift Schedule 👥
Hi there, in this video we're going to talk about adding users to individual shifts on a shift schedule. So to do so, we'll go to schedules on the lab map, we'll then go to the shift schedules tab, and we'll click into one of the previously created shift schedules here.
And we'll pick this one because in a previous video we have already created some shifts to add people to. And so if you've been watching this series, there's basically two things that go into this.
There's the list of users that are able to be added to this shift schedule, so, ... ... ... ... Typically it's going to be users that are p2 by 1, p2 by 2, p2 by 3 roles or are part of this cardiology faculty and staff group in this case.
But that may change based on your different needs and staffs. But basically what we're doing here is we're going to be adding a person to.
The shift schedule and so to do so, we'll just find the shift that I want to add to. So let's just say July 3rd here and you'll get this little menu and based on the users that are available to schedule here, you could scroll down the list and select someone to add.
You can also. Select multiple people at once. So if on this day it's going to be John, it's going to be Keith, it's going to be Robert.
We can add all those people to the shift schedule at the same time. We don't need to make like multiple entries and then we can click update shift.
Right? And we can basically repeat that as many times as we need to on the various shifts, whenever we need to.
So let's say on Thursday, it's going to be Preston. It's going to be Eric and it's going to be some guy.
What a great name. So we'll add him there. And so now that's for that date. And you may have noticed there, my list is not particularly long here, but your list of users may be longer.
This is also a search field. So it's pretty quick to find the different users that you need. If it comes down to it, if you're doing a larger.
List, please do use the search field to find the users that you need to. And there we go. We've added some people to the ships and the ship schedule.

How to Add Users to Shifts in Bulk 👥
Hi there, in this video we'll be going over how to add users to a series of shifts at once instead of individually.
So if we go to schedules on the left nav, we'll go to the shift schedules tab, and previously we used the shift schedule to add users.
So we'll do the same thing here except we're going to do it more like in bulk. So let's say that we have a user that's going to be on the Continuity Clinic AM shift, but they're going to do this shift basically every day of this week.
So this week of July 17th, right? So we could go through and add the user individually. Let's just say it's Preston to make it easy.
Right? So we did one entry there. We did one entry there. We did one entry there. And you get the idea.
It might take a little while, especially if someone's going to be on. That shift for a while. So let's just remove Preston from that.
And now we'll do this the faster way. And we'll just do it for the next two weeks to make it clear how kind of easy this is.
So click here. We'll select Preston. And then we're going to repeat the shift until a certain date. So my little video thing is hiding in there for me, but let's say all the way until the 28th.
And so if I click this button to update the shift, Preston will be added to every instance of the shift.
So the content and clank am shift until the 28th. And the cool thing about this is you can also do this for multiple users at once.
So we don't have to do it for Preston alone. Let's say he's going to share that shift with John and Eric too, right?
So if I click update shifts. Now all three of these folks will be on that shift for a two week period.
So I click update. And there you go. So I just saved myself a whole bunch of clicks by doing so.

Hi there. In this video we'll be talking about removing users from shift schedules or specifically individual shift schedules. So to do so we'll go to schedules and then we'll go to shift schedules and then here's where we've made our entries.
So previously there's a contour link on a schedule and so there's a couple of ways you can do this. If you're only removing a few people from the shifts it's fairly easy to just hover over these and hit the little x next to their name and that will remove them from that specific shift schedule.
You can kind of repeat that as needed. The other thing that you can do is if you're, if you're moving quite a few people it may be faster to just click into the shift schedule.
Click that x button in the corner of this field right here where you select the users and then that will effectively wipe it out and then you can just hit update shift.
So if you have quite a few people that are part of each shift schedule that might be a little faster for you than actually just hovering over each and clicking the x.
But if it's still one off changes like that, that doesn't take much, much time at all. So keep those in mind if you're trying to remove.
Users from individual shift schedules.

Removing Users from Shift Schedules Automatically
Hi there, in this video we'll be going over removing users from a series of ships at once. So to do so we'll go to schedules on our left nav, go to the shift schedules page, and we have some users on shifts here in the continuity clinic schedule, so we'll have a look at that.
And in a previous video we have added the users to a series of shifts automatically, and we're basically going to use that same function to remove them from that same series of shifts automatically.
So we can see here that Preston, John, and Eric, they're basically on this shift every day for the next two weeks here, and so if I click on this, and then I can remove the users individually if I only need to remove some people, or in this case I'm just going to remove everyone.
So I'm going to remove all items, and then I'm going to take my action and extend it to July 28.
So for these two weeks here, instead of just removing them one by one from each shift, I'm deciding, hey, I need to start over.
That was wrong, or for whatever reason, I need to remove them. And so if I do that, I can click update shifts, and this will remove them from all those shifts automatically.
So I don't need to do it individually.

How to Edit Shift Times in a Schedule 🎥
Hi there, in this video we'll be going over how to edit the times of a specific shift in a shift schedule.
So to do so we'll go to schedules on our left nav, click the shift schedules tab, and we've got some entries here on this continuity clinic schedule so we'll click the shift schedule Hi there, in this video we'll be going over how to edit the times of a specific shift and so in a previous video we created
the shift templates basically a morning shift from 8 am to 12 pm and then sometimes a afternoon shift from 1 pm to 5 pm but let's just say on this specific day while this is normal the case and we don't really need to make this change overall that for this specific day we need to change the timing so
in the same place where I am adding users to a specific shift I can also change the times so let's say in this case it's actually gonna be 7 am to let's go with 11 30 there's three so 7 a.m.
To 11 30 a.m. Update shifts and so for this specific shift now the times are different and I can always change it back if I need to but this is good practice to create the shift template to just have the shifts available when you need them and then if a specific shift has a time difference then you
just edit that specific shift you don't want to be messing around and click creating multiple shift templates each time some little change occurs for a specific shift you're better off just editing that specific shift to have those time changes

Automatically adding users to shifts based on their rotation schedule
Hi there! In this video, we're discussing automatically adding users to your shifts based on the rotations that they are scheduled to.
So this requires a little bit of beforehand knowledge about how rotations, rotation scheduling, and shifts, and shift scheduling works. But once you have a sense of how the two work, you'll see that they can pretty easily work together.
And there are many scenarios where you can handle, I have a student. They are on the clinic rotation, so that means that they're in clinic at site A from 8 to 12, and then they move to clinic at site B from 1 to 5.
Something like that, right? And so to set that up in metrics, you can go to system setup, rotations, and so you'll get a list of rotations here, and let's use that clinic as an example.
So what I'm going to say here is I'm going to create a shift schedule automatically based on if someone's on the clinic.
Rotation or not. So find the rotation you want, go to the actions column, and click this calendar icon that will take you here.
And so this is where you could set this up. So the shift schedule and the shifts themselves will need to be created beforehand because you're just selecting them here.
But we'll do that. So we'll go and select we're going to use the clinic schedule shift schedule. We're going to say on the morning shift am shift.
And so for any day that a user is scheduled to the clinic rotation, we will put them on the am shift in the clinic schedule.
And then we pick the days of the week this applies to. So let's say on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, they do the am shift.
Create that. And then we can do the same thing with the other shift. So let's say on pm shift. They do that on Tuesday and Thursday, right?
Something like that. And so when we add this rule on a nightly basis, the system will go in and look at who is on the rotation schedules.
And for any user that is scheduled to the clinic rotation, it will put them for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, on the AM shift under the shift schedule called clinic schedule.
And same idea for the PM shift, Tuesdays and Thursdays, PM shift on the clinic schedule. So if you have a shift schedule that is pretty regimented like that where, hey, if you're on this rotation, we pretty much know what shifts you're going to do and when you're going to do them and where you're going
to do them, you can practically automate the creation of those shifts by just using this feature and adding the student to the rotation.

Best Practices for creating shift schedules and shifts within them
Hi there. In this video we're going to discuss some best practices for creating shift schedules and the shifts within them.
So to do so, let's go to schedules on our left nav and then we'll go to the shift schedules tab here and we'll start with the shift schedules themselves.
Helps. There's a couple of things to keep in mind here. So when it comes down to it, a shift schedule is just a calendar and the shifts within them are just events that you can add people to.
At its core, that's all it is. And so if you're utilizing metrics at a relatively small program if it probably doesn't need to get any more complicated than that.
But if you are utilizing metrics for an institution where perhaps you send your trainees to a variety of sites perhaps those sites have their own reporting requirements.
Perhaps there are slot sharing agreements between sites for your resident's time. Things can get more advanced for some programs and that's when it's good to adhere to a couple of best practices.
And one obvious one here when it comes to creating shift schedules themselves is making sure that they are linked to an appropriate site.
So site submetrics are just places, right? And so you could see here that my clinic schedule is currently not linked to any site whereas my continuity clinic schedule is.
It's linked to Metrics Hospital North. So that means that any shifts that I put on there, any people associated with those shifts, I'll be able to pull reports later on that say hey where I can answer a question like how many trainees did I send to Site X to do Continuity Clinic this year, something
like that. I could answer that question by making sure I do data like that. When I don't have a site attached to my shift schedule, then I can't as easily do that.
And again, perhaps you're you're in a program or an institution where everyone rotates internally. And maybe it's not that important to necessarily care about the site because everything's at the same site anyway.
And that's just sort of understood by everyone involved, but that may not always be the case. And there are options here.
Like, for example, get public link. You can share a link to this schedule to other places. And so if you share to those other places they might not be aware of all the different ways you've set up metrics, whereas people in your own program are.
And so you have to keep them in mind as well. So the other thing, if you are going to link shift schedules to sites is you also then have to be considerate that you don't create shifts in that shift schedule that actually occur at other sites.
Because as you might imagine if you give this public link to someone, that person may not have a metrics account, probably doesn't know what metrics is.
Maybe they're just a nurse at another site and they need to know who's around on any given day. They, they might not know that.
Oh the PM shift is actually at a different location. That's not your PM shift. That's a different PM shift that we send our trainees to that it's not your site.
You know, they won't have that context. So a good rule of thumb is to not mix and match shifts that occur at different sites within the same shift schedule.
And if you're doing some more advanced reporting, I'll obviously that would be bad because you might associate shifts that don't actually take place at that site with that site.
And now the report is incorrect. So that's good practices to keep in mind when it comes to shift schedules and just to be clear to add you can add a site to a shift schedule when you make it but you can always come and change it if you need to.
So if I go to edit the clinic schedule here, I just have a dropdown where I could select the appropriate site that all these shifts take place.
So that's the big thing to think about for shift schedules. For shifts again, these things are pretty simple. They are just events that occur within a shift schedule.
But this is primarily on talking about the shift template. So a shift template is just a series of shifts, right?
It's like a repeating calendar event. So something that you want to be aware of. You might want to consider extending the end time, or the end date, for shifts instead of creating new ones.
So I see this with clients sometimes that reuse the same shift schedules year to year. So if you're doing something like that, what you want to avoid is basically creating the same shift names for different time periods.
Because over time, the amount of shifts that exist here will build up. They'll have different dates. Sometimes and it'll get confusing.
So it's much easier to just extend the existing shift and save that change versus making a new one and giving it the same name.
So that's the big thing with the shifts is just managing this and trying to avoid things that could cause duplication or confusion or you know, making a separate.
So let's say for, for some reason, one of these weeks the shift occurs at a different time. You probably don't need to make a separate shift template to occur to, to capture that.
You might want to do instead is just go and change the times here for that week. And so this way you're not duplicating the shift templates.
And now, oops, like I have the one week shift template here and now it's here forever. Cause I had to deal with it.
In that case, it's easier to just go. To the shift assignments themselves and change the times for an individual shift versus making a whole new shift template to deal with capturing that change for that one week.
And it never happens again. So those are just a couple of tips and tricks and best practices when dealing with creating and managing your shift schedules.

Adding a new faculty user in Medtrics
Today we will be talking about how to add a new faculty user into Metrix. So from the admin portal you will go to the users page which is the default page when you log in.
And you will select add person faculty. And then there are a few required fields here. There is first name, last name, email.
And there is home institution where the faculty will be at. And then there's the role. So the role will not be available to select if there's no home institution selected.
Clicked, we'll select preceptor. And then you have to ensure that you select an activation date. It could be a future date or a past date, just whenever you want this faculty to have access to the system.
Once you do that, you can save and close or you can save and continue to add additional information. You can, this is just a reminder to not forget to send them an email invite from the invite page.
So additional information you can add is personal contact information, address, birth place, salary. Emergency contact info, and there's additional information that is set up using the custom demographics, and that will be discussed in a different training video.
So that's it. Click save. And then the invite page here is where you would go to make sure that they get that invite email with instructions on how to log in.
You would select the checkbox, click the invite actions and then invite and send email. And that's it.

Adding a New Trainee in Medtrics
In this video, I will show you how to add a new trainee to Metrix. You would start from the admin portal, from the users page, from the left navigation.
Select to add a person and we will select a resident and ensure that the proper program is selected. The next one is a required field and then any additional programs you would like to add.
This resident to have access to as well. And there are a few required fields here. First name, last name, email, home institution.
And once home institution is selected, you will have access to as well. Select PGY1. And the activation date is required.
And it could be a future date or whenever you would like for the student or resident to have access to the system.
The class of field is institution administrator and they can make it option or required. A required field. If it's required, then it needs to be entered there.
So we're going to put here first name. Last name and email. And we're going to save and continue. And this is a message to remind you to send them an email invite.
Providing instructions on how to log into metrics for the first time. So it'll take you to the next page, which is personal contact information where you can enter additional birth date, address information, etc.
Emergency contact information. Citizenship status can also be entered. And then there's additional information that can be customized using the custom demographics settings.
And that would be under the. Institution portal. And that is for another video and that's it. Click save. And you would go to the invite page to send that email to the student.
So let's see here. I guess I already sent one, but what you would do is you'd click on this box here.
You'd have to register, more actions, and then invite and send email. So that's it.

What is a home institution?
Hi there. In this video, we're going over the concept of a home institution. So you're going to see that in various places in Metrics, even right here on the user's page, you'll see that the home institution is the listed for a number of these users.
And it is what it kind of sounds like, where you identify what institution effectively employs or has this training enrolled in their program.
And this can be useful for filtering reports and various kinds of demographic filtering and also just identify who's around and where they come from which can also be useful at times.
So two quick things about home institutions. If I go to edit Cole Aronson's profile here and go to edit demographics, if we scroll down to the bottom, we'll see that we have a list of home institutions to choose from.
I'll have to unlock the field first to let the system know I want to make a change to this. And then you can look through the list and select the appropriate home institution.
So this is where you'd go about changing it. I'm not going to go over where in the system. You might find it because it's all over the place and usable as a filter option in a number of places.
Well, speaking of filter options, let's actually head back to the user's page and just identify that there is a home institution filter that you can use here.
And you can use that to quickly identify. Who in your program comes from what institution? So we can see a number of people come from Metrix Hospital North here.
And then the last thing I want to address is how do we make or edit new ones, right? Or get rid of some if we need to.
And the trick here is that home institutions are just different. So if I go to sites here on the program portal, I won't have access to actually edit them.
So that access is limited to the institution portal, but you can see the sites that are available here. So if you're a program admin and you need a new site created because you have people coming in from a new place, you'll want to contact your institutional coordinator, GME office, something like
that to get them to make one for you. But you can view them here so you can know at all times which ones do exist.

Best practices for use of Roles
Hi there. In this video we're discussing best practices when it comes to deciding what kinds of roles you should have in the system.
So if you've been watching some of the other videos in these trading video series, the concept of roles is found throughout metrics and is used to decide who shows up and what places, who gets evaluations and who doesn't, who sees announcements and doesn't, who gets access to resource folders and who
doesn't, and basically everything. Roles are a central part of how we distribute information and create information in metrics. So it's important to consider that when you get started, what are my roles?
Going to be, and so we already have a basic setup of metrics here, so I can go to users and from my users page, I will have this drop down for role.
So here it functions as a filter for my users page, but this allows me to see all the different roles that are available for a program.
And so really the best practice here as with a lot of things is to keep it as simple as possible.
So easy example of that. I, let's say I'm a residency program, do MS1 and MS2. MS2 medical students rotate at our program?
Chances are no. So why do we need them here? It only increases the chances of us accidentally selecting something, not selecting something, and making something happen that we didn't want to happen.
So, looking through your list of roles on occasion and seeing in the next video. And thinking, do we actually need that?
Do we use that for anything? And if the answer is no, you should probably ask your GME department or whoever is in charge of setting up metrics for your program in terms of what roles are available and have them remove that if it is not being used this way.
One less thing, right? Always good. And if you don't have someone that necessarily manages that for you, you can always contact the metric support team directly and we can also help out with that.
Another thing to consider is basically how granular do you want to be when you are creating roles? So a good example is the concept of residence, right?
We have residents in our program, they are set as PGY123. That makes sense, because we are going to do things differently, we might assign evaluations differently or a different evaluation entirely if the resident being evaluated is a PGY1 versus a PGY2 or 3.
So that's separate. But separating the idea of this person as a resident into several different things makes sense. And so here we have another example, this one is not a trainee but a person that might interact with our trainees, a nurse, right?
And so here we've gone with what is for most programs probably an appropriate setup. We don't really, It doesn't matter what kind of nurse you are.
We're having you fill out an evaluation of a trainee as a nurse. You're a nurse interacting with our trainee, please fill out this evaluation.
The type of nurse or the type of setting, where that interaction takes place is not as relevant as you being a nurse.
So what you might want to avoid in a case like this is making several different nursing roles when your evaluations or none of the other setup that you're using in metrics actually would, it would matter whether or not that person is nurse X, nurse Y, nurse Z.
The type isn't relevant, it's just that they're a nurse. And so by keeping it as a single role instead of splitting it up by, you know, I guess you could say people's job titles.
This way you keep your list simple, makes it less likely for you to select the wrong thing or forget to select one of the three things.
I got nurse X, but I forgot nurse Y. Now nurse Y did not get an evaluation, but if we may just made them all nurses in the first place, it wouldn't be a problem because I just like nurse.
So really just, it goes for most things, right? Keep it simple. The simplest application of the concept of roles is probably the best one for the program.
You can always make more later if it comes up that yes, we do have a use case where nurse Y is going to get a different eval than nurse X.
Okay. Makes sense. We'll make nurse Y and you can utilize that, but it's usually better to start simple and work your way up than starting more complex and then simplifying because then you've probably created a bunch of data already that use that more complex setup.
And now that has to be dealt with. So if you just start simple and work your way up to more complexity, you can avoid having to do that kind of extra work.

How to use filters on users page
In this video I will show you how to use the filters on the user's page under the people tab. Click on the filters and click on any options.
One of them, roles, program, and they'll disappear from the list as you add them. So if you're looking for user type, you can say I'm looking for a resident and it will show all the residents if you want to filter down.
Even more, you can select the program. You can remove the filter by clicking on that X and then the role.
We can select PGY one and now we've got it filtered down even more, but let's say we want to select a home, it's find the home institution.
So we're going to select that and we have a more narrowed search. You can also use filters such as user status, staff status, and if an invitation was sent.
Different programs and affiliation status. All of these can be used to narrow your search when you're looking for a user in metrics.

Affiliate people to program
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about affiliating people to our program. So we're here on the program portal.
In this case, we're on dermatology. And this whole concept is mostly going to be for metrics users that are part of institutions that have multiple programs.
You don't really have this need if you're the only one. You're the only program using metrics because, well, you're going to have all the users anyway.
But if you're at an institution that has a number of programs on metrics, this can be a really helpful tool to not have people create like multiple accounts or anything like that.
You can just have the same account affiliated to multiple programs so they could be used in each of them. So if we go to users here, you'll see that in my program, I only have 13 people.
So a relatively small program right now, but I know that there's other people that work at, you know, metrics medical center and they need to be affiliated with my program because I need to use them for various things.
I need to. Make schedules for them. I need to make them rotation supervisors. I need to have them approve cases, you know, if they're attendings.
So any number of things that you might need to get done in metrics. And so instead of making them a separate account, all we need to do is affiliate them with our program.
And we do that from the users page here. We just click the. Affiliate people to program button. And what this will do is you see here.
I have 123 people at my disposal here. So whoever I need that already exists in the system. I can just go find them using memo search filters here.
So I know John Dorian's in the internal medicine program and he's gonna do some stuff in my program too. So all I gotta do is find them, click affiliate, and then we're done, right?
So this now affiliates John Dorian with my program. So I can do whatever I need to with his user account the same way I would do with users that are part of my program as their primary program.
And just like you see here you can also manage affiliations in general from this little pop-up. So I've added John Dorian and I can also remove him from the same place.

Deactivating and Reactivating Existing Rotations 🔄
Hi there. In this video we're going to talk about deactivating and reactivating existing rotations. So maybe for some reason we've changed something about rotations and we don't want to keep using the same rotation we made previously in metrics, we do allow you to deactivate those.
And deactivating also helps keep historical data preserved so we're not deleting. Things, we're just kind of keeping them out of your way unless you specifically go looking for them.
So, ah, to do so we'll go to system setup and rotations. And so here you'll see we have our list of various rotations for our program.
And all of these are by default active, right? So when we create one, a rotation is considered active and that is also the default tab that we have, ah, set to the page.
If you click on inactive here, this will show you all of the, ah, previously deactivated rotations. So let's stick with active here and let's learn how to, ah, deactivate rotations.
So you could see. There's actually going to be two buttons here. There's going to be a delete and then there's going to be a deactivate.
So you are not allowed to, ah, delete rotations that have schedules applied to them. So you could see here this little user schedules column and we could see a number in there.
So if you. You're going to see a number in there. You can only deactivate, ah, the rotation because we like to preserve, ah, that rotation, right?
We want to keep all that data intact instead of getting rid of it because who knows when we're going to need that data.
If we look at this here, cardiology rotation, there's no user schedules tied to it. So we can just. Delete it.
Easy peasy. And that goes. However, again, because there's data linked to save this clinic schedule in that same position, we have a deactivate button.
So if I click deactivate, that's exactly what happened. So it just kind of moved to the next tab here. You can see there it is.
I figured it was clinic or yeah, it was clinic. And you can see here right now it's got this little green activate button for me here.
So if I want to reactivate it, I just click that. And now it's going to be back. Right. And so it's just that.
Simple to deactivate or reactivate rotations. And the key thing here is going to be when you do this, right? So if you have offered the rotation in the past and you're just slightly changing something about it, you probably don't need to deactivate an old rotation and make another one.
But if you are changing something about it, that's like pretty substantial then you may want to consider deactivating the old version of the rotation and making a new one.
So in cases where the curriculum has totally changed, right? But you want to keep a historical record of what the curriculum used to be.
So in that case, you would want to create a new rotation for the new curriculum but deactivate the old rotation.
So that allows you to preserve everything as a it was when it happened, but allow you to move forward with the new rotation.
So there are various reasons for doing so. But this is the method that you can use to deactivate or reactivate rotations as you need to.
That's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.

Users filling in their own custom fields
Hi there, in this video we're discussing how users can fill in the data on their own custom fields. So this is typically utilized in MSP purposes for noteworthy characteristics, that is a common use case.
There may be others, but that is certainly the most common and pretty efficient way to do things in Metrics to collect that information.
So, in a previous video, I showed you how to create custom fields and metrics, and one of the options when creating, custom fields is to allow users to fill it in themselves.
So, what does that mean? That means that when a user logs in, they're able to go to My Profile, then they can click Edit Profile, and they will see, any of the additional, uhm, custom fields, whatever they might be displayed here and they can edit them.
So you can see noteworthy characteristics here, are long text fields so they have plenty of space here to go ahead and do whatever they need.
To to add in this information. But this can also apply to other types of fields, perhaps multiple choice, in which case they'll be presented with drop downs where they can pick the appropriate choices.
So they can make whatever edits they need to make, they can then click save changes, and then they'll be saved to those custom fields under demographics.
Now kind of a best practice here is to put limitations on what time period this can happen, and that's as simple as turning the checkbox on the custom field on and off.
So many schools will choose to have kind of like a period of time, one month, couple months, whatever it might be, where these fields are open.
They'll create some notifications around that, let people know, hey you have until this date to actually fill in the noteworthy characteristics, at which point we're gonna take that field away from you, right?
We're gonna turn that setting off, which will hide it, it will not allow users to that enter new noteworthy characteristics after that point, and that's important because at some point you do have to kind of cut things off where you can actually generate the document with the latest available data.
